When we don't humble ourselves, the Universe does it for us. Gosh, it's so much easier and friendlier when we learn to do it ourselves.
Intent is the root. Where action &amp; results sprout from. If you’re not happy with “what is” (results, feelings, responses), get curious about your intentions.  A friend hand-lettered this excerpt from my book, Renegades Write the Rules. #MondayMotivation https://t.co/ZdrdyunAZk
@timweston @imyke I was just checking out @toggl. I'm checking it out now. Thanks, Tim!
I'm seeking an app (for iPhone) to track/audit how time is spent. Not just screen time but time in general on everything from work tasks/categories to every day life things. Any suggestions?
Healthy tension conversations, when rooted in respect, are what fuel innovation. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. It lends great ROI.
You don't brand yourself.  You are yourself.  That creates a brand.   My top 5 tips on "Personal Branding" shared by @Bumble Bizz. https://t.co/OwGoG52EZH
@sueizzo Awww. Thank you, Sue! See you in a few days. #RenegadeBrandBootcamp here we come.
@nandoism Ha. Love to hear this! Thanks for listening.
Innovation is not for permission seekers. Ask for forgiveness instead of permission.
@nataliapetrzela @AnnRodriguez_20 I have that book too &amp; I am excited to dive in. Also Small Fry by Lisa Jobs-Brennen (Steve Jobs daughter) is very good. Currently reading Educated by Tara Westover. Very good. Both non-fiction but read like fiction.
@AnnRodriguez_20 @nataliapetrzela Thank you, Ann! Huge compliment. Appreciate you listening to the show. Hello, Natalia! Hope you found some good options.
When hustle meets alignment it turns into a dance instead of a fight.

Don't let anyone rent space in your head (or your social media feed) for free. It's valuable real estate. Be intentional about who you choose to follow.
@jmkelly This club is allergic to 3am workouts. ;)

You know that thing you've been thinking about doing but you think you can't because $ is a challenge?  Have you run the numbers? A simple spreadsheet can shine logic &amp; attainability on what seems unrealistic.
"Our brand isn't what we say, it's what people say about us."  - @jennifer, co-founder of @away on the Why Not Now? podcast, episode 119
@mattdelao Exactly! I find it gets comical sometimes when I follow things all the way through to me sleeping on my parents couch and eating Top Ramen. It would take awhile to get there.
1. Realistically, what's the worst thing that could happen? 2. What's the best thing that could happen? 3. Is this safe enough to try?  Three questions to ask when considering a "Why Not Now?" idea.
@AvishSood You googled!!
@AvishSood No guesses?
@johntmeyer @1MillionCupsSF Oh neat! I am familiar with this. Will let you know when I’m out east.   #spreadserotonin

@ShellyMccutcha1 It's amazing how we can gain momentum when we do that!
@GiggemMoore Yes and they freaked me out a bit. I've never seen bats that large. Wow.
@sueizzo Awwww. Thank you!!
Sometimes the pain of the procrastination outweighs the pain of just doing the darn thing. Deep thoughts as I procrastinate ...
@briannekimmel Thanks again for your recommendations. I may have had gelato from Messina 4 times. Ha. The best!
@GiggemMoore Check check. Did both and played checkers at the botanical gardens. thanks, Bill!
@AdamEsendex This was a common recommendation. Next time! Thank you, Adam.

@CoMoJoe @reddusfoximus yes! I’ve been doing this for years and it’s a great way to remember while having a decorative talking piece too.
@GiggemMoore @AndyStanley You bet. And of course! Otherwise, there’s no point in my opinion.
@allahdini Thanks for the list! I got Subtle Art on audible and need to revert back to it. Appreciate the reminder! I'll check the others out.
@TravisHigherEd I'm jazzed about Fast &amp; Slow. Creative Quest was good.

Lots of DJ references. ;) @bethcomstock is a badass!
@BobBurg @AnnieDuke @tom_peters @JamesClear Thank you for the heads-up! Atomic Habits has come up often as a recommendation. I am going to look for it at the airport. Any plans for 2019 books?

A little healthy tension never hurt anyone. It can actually be quite productive if good intentions and respect are the foundation.
@RichardGrewar @RayDalio @HardballChris Solid! It was amazing to interview @KerryKennedyRFK recently on my podcast. Fascinating, inspiring family.
@BobBurg @RayDalio Thanks, Bob. Books make amazing gifts. I like to highlight what I found interesting and write in the cover ... makes it more personal.
@TheRobbeo Nice. Yes. That's a definite staple.
Two books I'm giving away as holiday gifts: 1. Principles by @RayDalio  2. Surrender Experiment by Michael Singer  What were you favorite books this year?

@RyanKruegerROI Wow. This is awesome. Give her a huge high five for me please!
@MichelleKaneSD @SDCEO @LodgeatDeadwood Thank you for the opportunity, Michelle! Congrats on a successful event! Keep going. You’re doing important work.
You don't brand yourself. You are yourself. That creates a brand.
Personal branding is an inside job because we have to let go of what people want us to be. And the point when you finally drop that, is when you’ve arrived, at being you. You are you. You don’t brand yourself.
Don't let anything rent space in your head for free. It's valuable real estate. Take 100% responsibility as the landlord.
@AllisonMaslan Congrats on your book launch, Allison! Enjoy the ride.

@LennoxLewis Dallas!
@TravisHigherEd Wonderful!
@JonChiriboga Humanize as much as possible.   Are you crystal clear on the value you provide? And can you diversify the types of mediums you use to deliver that value?   Good luck!
@TravisHigherEd Facebook Group algorithms are more kind to us than being out here in the Wild Wild West. Ha. 😉 Upload your native video to a facebook group and you’re gold.
@rodrigoj_el You can also go through the exercise of “what’s the worst thing that could happen if I left my job?” Map that out literally.   Or start with “what if this doesn’t work? Then ask “Then what?” answer. Then ask “then what?”  Follow that through to worst case.
@mattdelao You bet! And at a super early stage, you might consider that everyone interviews everyone. Meaning you let your current team (at all levels) meet with candidates. That’s a way to explain/demonstrate your culture.
@rodrigoj_el If you had 24 hours left on this planet would you look back and wish you left your current job? That might be a place to start. Sounds trite but your gut reaction to that Q doesn’t lie. And it doesn’t mean you have to leave today but you can start making plans/moves today.
@jdgonzales Wowza. That’s a big one. Having a business partner is like having a spouse or life partner.  Chemistry, complimentary skill set, aligned visions, 100% honesty &amp; they MUST be fun to work with, otherwise what’s the point?
@TravisHigherEd One of my best tips is to try &amp; gather feedback early &amp; quickly after you get started. People will tell you what is helpful &amp; what resonates. Just ask them! And have social outlets where they have access to you on a regular basis. Might also consider a facebook group.
@mattdelao Do you have a profit sharing program  (stock options) or have you considered one? Great incentive for employees to feel ownership and be encouraged to stick around &amp; vest.   Otherwise, Culture. Culture. Culture. The entire team makes/decides the culture, not just leadership.
@Brett_Hughes Thank you, Brett. Lots of re-dreaming &amp; re-doing over here. I appreciate your note.
At the airport. Got nothing but time. Let me know if there’s anything I can attempt to do to help you.

@ScottONeil Sounds like a powerful event. What's you number one takeaway that you plan to implement, Scott?
@BobbiSue @darcangel21 @chrisguillebeau Thanks, Bobbie Sue! And Chris has actually been on my podcast too so you can double dip. https://t.co/FSMPO1YcsP
@baby_chicane It's brain activity via an EEG.
Your brain after sitting quiet for 20 minutes vs. your brain after 20 minutes of walking. This is why we should schedule walking meetings.  I share thoughts in this article: https://t.co/3TJLjeuNcb https://t.co/Cmc20wSTp8
@mistersterling I'm glad it resonated with you, Jon! We tend to say "yes" to things that we know should get a "no".
What would it look like if this were easy? - @tferriss   I’m experimenting with asking myself this question before beginning big projects or figuring out solutions to challenges. Powerful tool! Give it a whirl.
Me: Maybe I should do ___, it’s technically a good opportunity, it might lead to ___,  it will be profitable.  Intuition: Stop doing sh*t you hate. (In a quiet voice I clearly can’t hear.)  Rumor has it that there’s this quiet mystical voice inside of us that tells us what to do.
When you let go of who you are,  you become who you might be.  - Rumi
@seancarp @AlexBanayan Wonderful. I'm glad you enjoyed it, Sean! Thank you for listening.
From hacking into Warren Buffet's shareholders' meeting to chasing Larry King down in a grocery store, @AlexBanayan uncovers how wildly successful people have broken through and launched their careers. https://t.co/TyZPS5LB80

@NeonKnightChef Thanks for giving this episode a spin and for your note! One of the first that I did solo so it was a little spooky. #WhyNotNow #WhyNotNowPodcast
@AnneKScott Good to hear, Anne! Thank you for the note. Anything specific resonating with you?
@TTS401 @WWEDanielBryan @questlove Nice! I did the same thing Sunday. Rained all day. Enjoy.
A five degree shift changes our entire trajectory.
She went from climbing the corporate ladder to climbing the highest peak on each continent and skiing to the North and South Poles. Alison Levine talks about leadership, failure &amp; the danger of standing still. @Levine_Alison https://t.co/NB1qJ9I3vG
Votes are in! Next #WhyNotNowReadABook club book is @Questlove's 'Creative Quest'. I just started the book and I'm diggin' it. Just use the hashtag if you want to join us. @WWEDanielBryan &amp; I will review the book on the Why Not Now? podcast in a few weeks. https://t.co/dSf2URS0NK
@AIAofCanada @Twitter @Forbes Thank you for having me! I thoroughly enjoyed speaking with this group of women &amp; all of their questions. #EngageToElevate
@RunnymedeCap @WWEDanielBryan @Flatironbooks Welcome to the club, Andy! And thanks for giving my book a spin. You’re the best.
Every time you post a photo, or update your status, you are contributing to your own digital footprint and personal brand. Social media is changing the way we communicate and the way we are perceived, both positively and negatively.

@NeedsOfThe1 @WWEDanielBryan @Flatironbooks It is real. Find Your Influence is our partner.  Thanks for checking!
@WWEDanielBryan @TTS401 Here are the book options! See poll above.
@stuartdgreen87 @WWEDanielBryan You can vote if you'd like. We're doing a twitter poll tomorrow.
@stuartdgreen87 @WWEDanielBryan Thanks for listening to the review, Stuart. You'll like this book. Very powerful. Welcome to the club. We're picking the next book tomorrow!
@themartincox @WWEDanielBryan Hilarious. I was just talking about this little icon the other day and trying to remember if it had a name. Thanks for bringing back the memories. Clippy was a Word Doc stalker.
@themartincox @WWEDanielBryan Agreed! Incredibly generous. I hope college grads take him up on the offer. It's a powerful book.

@yazjd89 @WWEDanielBryan @Flatironbooks Anyone, anywhere, is welcome to join!
@GoodMangoes2war @SHAQ It's been a wild ride to see the space shift. That's kinda crazy and funny at the same time when we think about what did and didn't exist back then.
We announced Shaquille's retirement on social media 7 years ago today. Oh how the twitterverse has changed. @SHAQ https://t.co/TMvJP7o74l
@andylassner You’re three things to me &amp; my Twitter feed: Real. True. And Funny. I realize you’re a loyal NHL fan but is there any chance you could dabble in the NBA too? We could have used you tonight for some comedic relief. It’s only game 1 so there’s still time. Cc @EdGlavin
@mowheeler Absolutely not. However, don’t ya think we need a little diversification when it comes to offense? What one player has ever won a championship on their own?
@GavinRamblesOn No clue. I still have the “taking my talents to South Beach” days fresh in my mind only because I worked in the NBA in those days and took a step back (and break) after. Regardless, I admire his affinity to his Ohio roots &amp; going back.
@GavinRamblesOn Yep. He sure did. Still can’t do it solo! And I agree he’s unmatched. All the other unmatcheds had sidekicks.
@DIRECTV @NBA Also, ESPN isn't working either. Just a heads-up.
@DIRECTV @NBA Hi Maria, why is ABC not available? We have done a workaround and set up our Apple TV to an online stream for this game. Thank you.
@joesgotcrohns @DIRECTV @NBA @ABC Yeah, @DIRECTV still isn't working. Had to hack AppleTV and an online stream. I like your idea though!
@MatLaVore @WWEDanielBryan I couldn't agree more, Mat, and I actually highlighted this section. That's one of the things I appreciate about this book, it not only educates us about the facts but also on how we can learn to shift our thought patterns. Makes us more self-aware.
@romello78 Kanye is there recording an album and it appears there's a stunt to listen to the album in Jackson Hole, WY. All I know is that Mr. West is the reason for Wyoming trending. Thoughts, given you're another Wyoming native?
@WillSch Thank you for making this happen with the books! @WWEDanielBryan and I are jazzed to get to give these books away!
Heads-up readers, we're giving away copies of our 1st book for the book club. To win a copy of Factfulness, share a photo of you reading any book &amp; use the hashtag #WhyNotNowReadABook. @WWEDanielBryan &amp; I are picking winners randomly. Thanks for the books @Flatironbooks! https://t.co/NWiGeQwNdt
@RunnymedeCap @ValerieSimon @SHAQ @TheRock Hi Val, nice to meet you. And thanks for the kind words, Andrew. If you decide to read the book, Val, let me know what you think.
@IanGertler @jennakutcher Glad you found value in the email update, Ian! It was great to connect with @jennakutcher. Many gems in that episode.
How to have the best brainstorming session ever. @SimonSinek shares the science &amp; secrets behind the sometimes productive (sometimes not) meetings.   A valuable one-minute listen. Or listen to the full podcast episode here: https://t.co/nH1a8Fl3N0 https://t.co/VMSrbwdlR6

@BridgetteRobles @YPSportsChat @adlandiapodcast @AmaraBaptist @ShahbazMKhan @kfgwinning @SparklesSports Honored to be in this line up. Thanks, Bridgette! Appreciate you listening to the Why Not Now? podcast.
Interviewing Laird Hamilton tomorrow for the Why Not Now? podcast. Holler if you have any questions you'd like me to ask. @LairdLife
Have we taken the concept of 'Personal Branding' too far? The danger is that the highly polished, static image can start to elbow out the real us.  https://t.co/9WO8c6I6Er

@FEEZYDoesIT @RichardGrewar Whaaaaaa?
@RichardGrewar @FEEZYDoesIT And it feels more Australian! Ha.
@peterstringer Hummmmmmm.
@FEEZYDoesIT @RichardGrewar Yep. That's what I'm living with - The "___" (enter 'sport' there).  Yup.
@LoungeOfficer @RichardGrewar No. You're watching hockey. Not 'The Hockey". ;)
@BobbiSue You are so funny.  I always think I know what you're talking about but then question --- Do I?!?!?
@ideabloke @celtics That's hilarious because at first I wasn't understanding what you meant and then realized the tile in my floor *kiiiinda looks like parquet? Ha. Hope you're well, my friend. Good to see your name pop up.
Him (from Australia): Are we going to watch the basketball? Me (from America): Uh, I'm planning to watch the basketball game.  That's the difference between Australians who discuss sport and Americans who discuss sports.  cc @RichardGrewar (the Australian)
@RMCPositive @celtics For sure not. It's all nonsense. Yeah, for sure.
@huskyjr1201 @celtics We should introduce our friends. This is such an important topic in the world of sports.
Does anyone else look at the @celtics parquet flooring &amp; think of Parkay butter? Asking for a friend. #CLEvsBOS https://t.co/rQnylt3zuO
@darrenrovell When you see the @celtics parquet flooring, do you ever think of Parkay butter? I'm asking for a friend. She's kinda weird. Very important stuff though. #Nba #celticscavs

@hhumphrey123 Great article. Especially the part about leaders refusing to micromanage. There's such a difference between leading and managing. Thanks for sharing, Holly!
Heads-up book lovers: @WWEDanielBryan &amp; I have started a book club! The 1st book is Factfulness by @HansRosling. We'll review it together on the Why Not Now? podcast in June. To join us, just read the book &amp; share your thoughts using the hashtag #WhyNotNowReadABook https://t.co/c5mE3OeTvo
@AKGarcia331 @BryanLDanielson This is awesome, Andrea. Ironically, I typically do TM but this morning I tried the 100 deep breaths instead and found it useful. It was a bit of a mix between TM and deep breaths actually. Whatever works to quiet our minds is good!
For anyone who's considering making the leap from the corporate world to building your own world: @JennaKutcher shares exactly how she navigated the change after buying a $300 piece of equipment. She now runs a wildly successful business. https://t.co/x1qzRlehK8
@stuartdgreen87 Thanks for this incredible review! Appreciate you taking the time to share and to listen on a regular basis.
@DDSotelo Thanks! Glad it resonated with you.

@BFormals Nice. Welcome to the club!
Social media algorithms. This sums up the ridiculousness, frustration &amp; humor of marketers chasing the mystical algorithm. It's like trying to herd cats. @AwakenWithJP strikes again: https://t.co/dsUv2dFnMd
@NikHarrMusic @WWEDanielBryan I was also surprised about the 4 levels of income. It was well mapped out.
@NikHarrMusic @WWEDanielBryan Welcome to the club! Enjoy the read and keep us posted on what you think of the book.

In case you were wondering what the results were on this important, worldly topic.   I disagree with the consensus and believe ninjas hacked the poll while pirates were busy being tough. https://t.co/3W1ID5oM0X
@WWEDanielBryan @TonySeigh Yeah, you should really focus on that ambition. Only 54 books a year? That's only an average of 3.78 million words a year. Get it together, buddy. ;)
"Comparison is the thief of joy." - Theodore Roosevelt  There's a difference between real life &amp; the highlight reels we share on social media. Just a friendly reminder as we scroll down the rabbit hole.
@Andrewrosch Wow. I had no idea. Thank you for sharing that with me.
@cescobar78 Pirates and parrots like two peas on a pod. Ha.
@alfabloodtype You picked up on the key word in the question - "Tougher". That's different than "who would win?" Agreed. Pirates are tougher.
@craymonddd Agreed. I'm team pirates as well.
@GoodMangoes2war Oh wow!
@IndiemarchFilm Very interesting answer, although I'm team pirates. The Prius vs. Roadster is quite a clever analogy.
@WAD1980 Thanks for sharing, Will. I enjoyed the conversation with @WWEDanielBryan. And he reads a book a week! Incredible.
@Lagana Thank you, David! It was a blast interviewing @WWEDanielBryan. So many layers to him.

Pirates or Ninjas.  Who's tougher?  And why?
@devoNOTbevo I hear ya. It was typed because I found myself worrying. Self-awareness is power though! We often share what we need to hear the most.

@BrianKapur @ShaunJay @TheRock That's awesome and I bet you do a great People's Eyebrow after all of that practice. Good thing it didn't get stuck that way?!

@IndiemarchFilm Gotcha. Are your current clients asking for these other areas of service?
@HashtagChad @kennytomlin Thanks for listening, Chad. Agreed, Kenny has a ton of value to offer!
@IndiemarchFilm As for the talent component, there's a private facebook groups I could add you to that has some pretty incredible set up for talent seeking/finding in this area. Also, I recently lived in Vegas so I'll give it some thought!
@IndiemarchFilm Hummm. I have lots of thoughts on this. And Q's for you. When you say, "we really need some senior leadership experience in the growth + branding development field" - what's driving that need?
@IndiemarchFilm Congrats on your growth! Is you question about strategic direction or where to go to source talent?
@mattdelao If you warm up a conversation online using social media first, then call ... then it's not so cold? Also, creating a database of email from customers can help generate leads too if you haven't already done that. Our best customers are existing customers! Hope that helps.
@mattdelao Also, definitely have your own insta account, if you don't already, and you can test or weave in some biz-centric content there too - especially if you customers, or potential customers, follow you personally.
@mattdelao I'd check out certain instagram hashtags relative to your industry &amp; audience to gauge the existing volume of content and authors/accounts for that content. Do the same for peripheral industries. If you feel you can offer value through that channel then absolutely!

@BigEastSilver Little bit of this, little bit of that and FOCUS is written in large letters on the top. It's a combo of personal items on the right and business items on the left. And what's on yours?
There's a difference between a "To-Do" list and a "To-Do Today" list.  If my To-Do Today list doesn't fit on a 3"x 3" sticky note then I re-prioritize. It's one of those days where I need to remind myself of this concept!

@TravisHigherEd Great question. I was advised to release at least 3-4 right out of the gate to build momentum. To gain momentum, maybe as an incentive you could tell listeners that the first XX people who subscribe, rate and review the podcast, get a copy of the book when it's out?
@RichCampbellPhD Thanks, Rich! Could be much worse. If airlines gave points for airport delays I'd be Platinum. Ha.
@romello78 Thank you, Richard! Could be much worse. I'm an airport delay expert.

@mattdelao Some advice would be... to be real vs. just showing the highlight reel. Connection is more important than a static "image" we try to create that's not truly alive.
@mattdelao Hi, Matt! I now struggle with the term "personal branding" because to many, it means a static, polished version of oneself &amp; it can elbow out the real you. That said, there are some tips in here that might help. Give it a spin. https://t.co/dROkPJJZRG

@Mark_Hodgkin Thank you for sharing your feedback, Mark! There's been amazing feedback on the @RyanHoliday episode for good reason. He offered a great deal of value. I appreciate you listening.
@ChrisYandle Oh and by the way, please add me to the list of people who have said they want to support you in a crowd-funding campaign. I've seen your book topic, I'm familiar with your work and I believe in you.
@ChrisYandle I understand how you feel and I would also believe the people that want to support you. What's the worst thing that can happen? People ask for investment in their projects/ideas all the time. How is this different? Just curious to hear more about what you're thinking &amp; feeling.
@ChrisYandle Congrats! Have you considered crowdfunding?
I have some free time for a bit, holler if there's anything I can do to help you. It's been awhile since my last attempt to spread some serotonin and I've missed it! Let's go.
@ChrisYandle I hear ya. Ryan's book came at a perfect time for me too - a season of humbling experiences.

@mattdelao @jessicaalba Great question. Thanks, Matt!
@_fmanto @jessicaalba My guess is she'd want you to be you. Ha. ;) I hear what you're saying though! Pretty incredible path she's paved for herself.
I’m really excited to be interviewing @JessicaAlba on the Why Not Now? podcast today. Do you have a question you’d like me to ask her? #WhyNotNow

@vickiestevens14 Welcome to the team! How far along are you?
Travel debacle. Plenty of airport time. Book suggestions?
@ROBEW1 @VanJones68 @penguinrandom With all due respect, you could add a profile photo. Not having one makes your credibility, identity &amp; authenticity suspect.

@marco_valera @Jeffrey_Len Welcome to Team Pirates.
@mstrvtkd That's pretty hilarious. Thanks for the chuckle.
@BruceLeeFDN @brucelee Fair enough!
@teesang It's meant to be left to your interpretation. Ha.
I vote pirates, btw. Remember, this is tougher, not cooler, more accurate or scarier. Argh.
It's Friday. Let's get the important stuff out of the way. Who's tougher, Pirates or Ninjas?

@RichCampbellPhD Let's definitely connect on that! Thanks for having my book be a part of the curriculum. I see students tweeting me. Very cool.
@ShaunJay @HubSpot You could make it a goal for next yr! Follow this current one close. There's a stage called Bold Talks at Inbound. Might be a good target.
@ShaunJay @HubSpot I've been fortunate to speak at #Inbound a few times. Biggest stage I've ever had. 10k people in the audience. Bambi legs! Amazing though.

When you commit to making your authenticity a higher priority than managing your image, you no longer need to manage your image.
@Theo_Dimarhos Cool! Shoot me more info via DM.
@TheCozyNE I'd start with your personal Facebook first to build a base but test Twitter and Instagram too.
@execgolftravel I'd promptly depart twitter in this case and seek assistance in the physical world. The virtual world can only help so much in this case.
@mompowerment Using social media channels to tell the story behind why you wrote the book. Not for personal branding &amp; image but to authentically connect.
@Malliard Have you asked your listeners for feedback? Also, @SunGroupWP just got back from a podcast conference. Any golden nuggets, Winnie?
@Malliard I hear ya. Most of ours do. But now I feel challenged! Try me. ;)

@SunGroupWP A13. Voices of authority who are fiercely honest. All of these ones on the Why Not Now? Show: https://t.co/j5EBZ2e4nq #Pm17 #winniesun
@SunGroupWP A12. It's "free" entertainment &amp; education. Edutainment. For publishers, it builds a stronger bond w/ listeners = conversion. #winniesun
@SunGroupWP A11: They don't know their audience, espisodes are too long, try to be too general. #WinnieSun
@SunGroupWP A10: Set an intention or goal and keep your eye on that ball. Focus, focus, focus. ROI doesn't always mean $. #winniesun
@SunGroupWP A9: All of them. Twitter, facebook, instagram (especially stories w/ link) &amp; LinkedIn (don't forget LinkedIN!) #winnieSun
@SunGroupWP A7: I do have one! Why Not Now? https://t.co/j5EBZ2e4nq #PM17 #winniesun

@LoungeOfficer @SunGroupWP At 10pm every evening, my calendar dings &amp; says "Gratefuls". I use that moment to think about 3 things I'm grateful that happened that day.
A7: After 10 yrs in this space, I went on a social media cleanse. I set a new strategy &amp; ground rules: https://t.co/CZH9S3wP2c #WinnieSun
A6a: The magic, often missing, ingredient is purpose. That’s what gets you through droughts &amp; keeps you going. #WinnieSun https://t.co/WixfGSIgLr
A6: Passion + skill aren’t enough. Passions change &amp; just because you’re good at something doesn’t mean you enjoy doing it. #WinnieSun https://t.co/WixfGSIgLr
A5a: Second best $ decision I've made was to better understand what the heck intuition is, how to listen to it &amp; how to trust it. #WinnieSun https://t.co/pgVhW1uaBO
A5: My best financial decision was to stop chasing the money. When we chase things, they run from us. #WinnieSun https://t.co/pgVhW1uaBO
@LoungeOfficer @SunGroupWP I love Untethered Soul by Michael Singer. Will think on others too!
A4: I’ve taken an unexpected path but yes, social media has been a key tool in my financial freedom. Not talkin' online sales. #WinnieSun https://t.co/4JHugl9LDK
@markboothe Agreed, Mark!
A3a: Consumers are fatigued &amp; craving more REAL life vs. highlight REELS. #WinnieSun https://t.co/n8N2j2kuVr
A3: When brands practice (genuine) altruism in this space their social media ROI increases. Consumers are craving this behavior. #WinnieSun https://t.co/n8N2j2kuVr
@SunGroupWP So grateful to be here with you today, Winnie! Having fun &amp; learning alongside everyone else. Thanks for having me!
@ideabloke Thanks, Randy. Lots of falls, scrapes &amp; debacles that led me to that realization!
A2b: $ is energy. When I'm chasing, grasping &amp; clinging I’m operating from fear &amp; scarcity. Not a good strategy. Not a good look. #WinnieSun https://t.co/6iqC87y8Vw
A2a: Where purpose, passion &amp; skill collide, bliss resides. And the money arrives. That intersection is always my target. #WinnieSun https://t.co/6iqC87y8Vw
A2: It's taken me awhile &amp; I’ve learned the hard way but as soon as I realized what enough looked like I became free &amp; wealthy. #WinnieSun https://t.co/6iqC87y8Vw
A1a: My top 3 social media rules: 1.) Set your intentions for using the space. 2.) Know your value. 3. Deliver your value. #WinnieSun
A1: Social media is the ultimate equalizer. It gives a voice &amp; a platform to anyone willing to engage. It's powerful. #WinnieSun

@GoodMangoes2war @jimkwik Johnny 5! More input!!!!
@antoniosacre @TonyRobbins Well thanks for listening! Welcome to the club.
@EvanRJones Keep me posted! I was meh on it too until I did it. Super simple. Easy and quick to learn. It's worth getting more time back in your day.
In about 10 mins, @JimKwik taught me how to speed read. Increased my retention &amp; pace by nearly 50%. Learn from Jim: https://t.co/V18OG51sjI https://t.co/G3fPRejhbn
@GiggemMoore Check out my podcast with @AdamGrant. He talks a bit about subconscious gender biases toward the last half: https://t.co/tbTnGdNrX3
@Phil_McNamara @TonyRobbins His Unshakable book is great for breaking things down well. Thanks for listening, Phil! "If you want to take the island, burn your boats!"
@IanGertler Yes. Lots of speaking events lately. Some aren't public, more corporate. There's @DigitalSummit_ in May. Atlanta!
@GiggemMoore Have the male leaders in the company mentor the women &amp; focus on addressing unconscious gender biases. Video: https://t.co/lESUqgx69U
@IanGertler Thank you! It was fun taking calls.
@bkmcelroy And listening to the people around you who love you. I wish I would have listened more to my family telling me to take care of myself.
@bkmcelroy Thanks for listening! She talked about mindfulness. I echo that w/ @Headspace. Helps me learn when to make vs. let things happen.
@dcoppeler @jimkwik Thanks for sharing! This episode with Jim really hit home with me.
"Life is happening for you, not to you." @TonyRobbins on the Why Not Now? podcast: https://t.co/zUUHay0XQM https://t.co/M1lqK0QK0W
@GiggemMoore Love it. Such a great question you asked too.
@howeaboutsports Success is defined differently for everyone. For me, a healthy mind is key. That unlocks everything else.
@howeaboutsports People who find that dance between knowing when to make things happen &amp; when to let them happen.
@GiggemMoore How about you?
@GiggemMoore That's exactly when I hit the SOS button on @Headspace. No joke. Priority = get my self talk situated. https://t.co/jta9jtROHG

@ashleymcnamara I'm taking quite a bit from it. Super quick read. I suffer from shiny object syndrome so it's a good tool for me.

@ClayTuckett @Billy @SmashingPumpkin @Lagana Thank you for sharing that, Clay. Glad you enjoyed. It was a special dynamic. We had never met!
@BornBarikor @_Auntie_Zee_ Ha. I'm impressed. I can only do fake push-ups. Well, maybe a few real and then cheaters.
@_Auntie_Zee_ @BornBarikor You can use it in the office and share. Consider it a conf. room that you "book" &amp; take turns. Ha.
@_Auntie_Zee_ @BornBarikor Sounds like a desk is very much in alignment w/ focus on fitness. And then there's this benefit too. https://t.co/jJCvAZQrfX
@_Auntie_Zee_ @BornBarikor I'm exhausted just watching. I've never seen anyone who basically bounces off the ground while doing push-ups.
@lauren_lbc @Billy @SmashingPumpkin @Lagana It's called @Headspace. Happy to give you a 30 day code if you want to give it a try.

@Billy Enlightening indeed. Our chat was hands down one of my favorite all-time conversations. Thank you for being generous with your time.
@cindygallop Agreed. Great @Audi ad. Props @VenablesBell. Is it an indication that the brand will be adding women to their board too?
@ndxcc  It's beyond frustrating when companies use women empowerment as a marketing/PR platform &amp; don't walk the talk.
Hey @Audi, you might consider adding some women to your board. The upside is greater than just optics. Research: https://t.co/oTMIq3ci4X https://t.co/Eqk8nm3ZCv

@themorrisonfam Bernie, Trump &amp; Hillary. Already read Obama. The process of switching back &amp; forth is a bit jolty but it stretches my brain.

@SheBrandLiz Bernie, Trump &amp; Hillary. Already read Obama. The process of switching back &amp; forth is a bit jolty but it stretches my brain.
@naheedR Bernie, Trump &amp; Hillary. I've already read Obama. The process of switching back &amp; forth is a bit jolty but it stretches my brain.
It's powerful to understand differing perspectives. Concurrently reading 3 books from very different politicians to strengthen this trait.

Diversify media sources. Spoke w/ someone who listens to only one TV media outlet. They're unaware of critical things that have happened.
This is a critical time to be doing our own research on issues. Read. Learn. Listen. Understand. Get outside of our Facebook feed bubbles.

@Franny_Pants Thank you for everything! This has been such a smooth experience.
@keithpape @Franny_Pants Grow down, not up!
@AlyaIS Ha. Lady Renegade is currently in San Diego. Although I think her name changed when we sold her.
@JenMitch Yeah, Real Life &gt; Highlight Reel. Our society definitely tends to romanticize entrepreneurship.
@KatPan Yes, there should be a fine for littering online. We need to protect the (virtual) environment too!

@elisaldivar Great to meet you, Eli! Please do stay in touch.
The grass isn't always greener on the other side, it's just that hopping the fence is fun (yet fleeting).
When your airline texts you and tells you that you have a "risky connection" ... is that a thing?
@christianarens Thanks, Chris! Looking forward to the event and catching up with you.

@Evan_McMullin @mindyfinn Thank you for coming on the Why Not Now? show. Props to you and your nobel mission. Inspiring.
@ES_Entrepreneur @tonyhsieh Me too. It's kind of amazing how behaviors can start to shift if you follow it 100%. Hope you're well, Emma!

@DakKnightRises @ByTimReynolds Any tips for Aussie pups who nip? She's so smart and already doing many commands but likes to herd her owners
@DakKnightRises @ByTimReynolds OMGoodness. Love your pup. Those blue eyes. Can't wait for her to play in snow that sticks. How old is yours?

@YogaGlo Thank you for spreading the good word! Brilliant @kathrynbudig offers so much wisdom in the episode.
@Little_K Thank you for helping #SpreadSerotonin, Katarina! You never know what impact you're making by just asking people. @kindness_org
People are skeptical when they're asked how you can help them. Rightfully so with trolls &amp; creepy clowns but kindness is still an option.

A debate can either be a productive conversation, still full of healthy tension, or a negative circus led by time thieves. The former wins.
@edgardneidorf @sophiaamoruso Thank you! Sophia is a badass, eh? I'm very fond of her classy navigation. Glad you're enjoying the show!
@MorganLMartinez Might try helping someone else and talking it through with someone. That POV helped me.

@FerraroOnAir @GarretKramer I'm not interested in a debate about what Sunday Blues mean. Let's focus on solutions. :)
@GarretKramer @FerraroOnAir What is your solution to someone struggling w/ the Sunday Blues. How would you help them?
@GarretKramer @FerraroOnAir It's a signal. A cue. You have to start somewhere. Possibly we are over-thinking? ;)
@JonGStillwell Humanize before you monetize. And listen, listen listen. Define your unique value. Those are a few ...
@MorganLMartinez Might try helping someone else with theirs? Might work. Did you say you took @simonsinek's online course w/ discount code?
If you're feeling a major case of the Sunday Blues, consider it a helpful sign that it's time to rethink what you do on Monday.

@GavinRamblesOn Secretly, this is actually selfish because it makes me feel good.
@byGenevieveB Don't let anything rent space in your head for free. It's valuable real estate. Be a strict landlord.

@peterstringer You got it! Me too.

@AmyTrask Are you from SoDak?! You're guess isn't far off! Beach sounds lovely. I hope to make it there when I land in the other SD.
@admanchris See you there!? On my way.
It's colder than a polar bear's toenails in South Dakota. First frost this morning. Bring on San Diego! https://t.co/1noIXgKE0i

@MissyBuchanan Mine are 2 and 5. SOOOO cute and a little feisty for the 5 year old who just started kindy.
@whallgren @mcuban I vote for POTUS not Veep. He could get more done.
@CLuong708 @Headspace @mcuban Ha! Now if only I could stop taking calls like him too. Not quite there yet ;) Baller, strategic move though.
@Hospitalityfan @mcuban Thank you, Jim! It's a labor of learning. This interviewer role is new to me but I'm enjoying the process. Challenge
@AdamEsendex @iTunes @Headspace Thank ya. Safe travels back to the UK. It's great to reconnect with you, Adam.
@CLuong708 @mcuban @Headspace Good to hear, Carol! The @mcuban episode is resonating. It's refreshing to hear honest, smart opinions. Thx!
@_SDU_ Deal! Thank ya.
@MissyBuchanan Niiiiice. Not too shabby. I have two nephews and I would love to spend more time w/ them. How old are your gkids?
@pearceweb Thanks Tucker! The @mcuban episode is on FIRE! Appreciate you sharing and listening.

@disguyyy Thank ya, Tony. Appreciate your support and get your zzz's though! Sandman will haunt us otherwise.
@whallgren Yes! #MC2020 I'm sure there's a more clever hashtag &amp; campaign name than that. Crowdsource? Kidding @mcuban. #CubanRevolution2020

@SunnyLenarduzzi Thanks, Sunny! It's been a labor of learning for sure. Excited to improve and grow. Keep the feedback &amp; reviews coming pls!
@tea2sugars @Headspace Ahhh. The brilliant @simonsinek. He has a new book that launches Sept. 12th, btw. It has scents. Little bit o trivia.
@tea2sugars @Headspace I love asking that question. Figure if there's one thing we can study we might as well know about mindfulness, eh?
@AmirAsias @iTunes @Headspace Nice. Keep truckin. ROI increased over time for me. I'm on the anxiety pack. ;) LOVED the focus pack.
@eddietomalin Distractions. Any notifications from your calendar, social media, text messages, email, updates, etc. It's the 'quiet' button.

@Saltedslug Wow! Pretty incredible.

@AmyJoMartin That would be entrepreneur not *entrapreneur. Still not following the rules. I'm not deleting it though. Stronger lesson. :)

@Saltedslug Really? I'd love to go to Egypt sometime. Thanks for reading the post. That trip was life-changing.
@CarmenLovelace Hello!!
@andypuddicombe New morning routine: I don't look at my email or social media until after @Headspace &amp; journaling. Simple game changer!

@MorganLMartinez Wonderful!!! Love it. Thanks for the photo.
@ChloeCountertop @Headspace Same. And there are days when the SOS button is pushed a few times. 😉
Sometimes the grass is greener on the other side because it's fake grass. Know the diff. between real life &amp; social media highlight reels.
@msjwrites Yasssss! Come visit me in the Black Hills, please.
@replikate @Headspace Same here! I have been using the on-the-go walking and commuting (on airplanes) too.
@joeDmarti I missed your chat. Bummer. Personalized marketing as in custom consumer marketing or personal branding?
@joeDmarti @Headspace @Adobe Very cool! Have you ever used it?
@ThePeoplesDr What I would give to be there! Maybe I can join you next year. #GSummit
That moment you realize you're overcapacity. @Headspace SOS button to the rescue. My 3 min cure. Ready, set, stop. https://t.co/P5uILE69py

@ambermac How old are your kids, Amber? I was thinking about this for my nephew.
@topwop3 @ambermac @Headspace @AmirAsias This is incredible, Jordan. Do you like to use a specific session/pack for your pain/stress relief?
@Roll_Tide22 Ummmmm. Pretty much. Something like that among other inventions.
@AmirAsias @ambermac And in a few days I'll have a @Headspace month free subscription offer too alongside my podcast launch ...

@Cu_As Same here! Dr. @michaelcrow is a badass. Oh how things have changed since we were at @ASU. It was cool back then too though ;)
@Austin_Brown_ True. Also, I'd actually say our 'purpose' (WHY as @simonsinek says) is what gets us through droughts? My passions change.
15 yrs ago I graduated from the #1 party school in America. Now ranked #1 Most Innovative School. Nice hustle, @ASU! https://t.co/jcfhE6mkrp
Often times our hustle factor is our biggest differentiating factor. Build some sweat equity.
@MorganLMartinez Nice! I'll keep an eye out. Have fun with this.
@rebeccalounyc @taniakatan @Aleenaslemonaid @axosoft The cape is classic awesomeness.
@justlikeharmony Always makes me feel better and scientifically it does spread to whoever is exposed to the experiment.

@sfhosley Thanks, Sean. Secretly, it's selfish actually because it makes me feel good. Don't tell anyone though. ;)
@karaboseane Please do! Looking forward to hearing from you. Don't forget. I won't!
@coolbearcjs And I know it's stating the obvious but the number one key is to make sure the influencer truly does like &amp; use the product. :)
@coolbearcjs Focus on the long-term too. The one and done transactional stuff doesn't lend sustainable ROI. Flash in the pan doesn't work.
@coolbearcjs My best advice for influencer relationships is to have equal value exchange. Figure out what can help them with beyond $.
@michellezaffino Thanks for giving the book a spin. Interesting concept you have there w/ helping solve crimes via digital. Curious.
@karaboseane Awesome. I'd start here: https://t.co/dROkPK1AJe and here: https://t.co/90sSgKB6Hh for tips. Keep me posted! #SpreadSerotonin
@pauljeremiah Very cool ;) #SpreadSerotonin &amp; musical memories too.
@coolbearcjs Have you reached out to influencers already? If so, what has the response been?

@HeidiJannenga Thank you for all of your support @Heidi and Brad! @aleenaslemonaid and I are so grateful.
@paullyoung @ForeignCinemaSF Wonderful food, atmosphere &amp; company! And agreed, our server was great. (He had brown &amp; teal glasses.)
Social Media is the ultimate equalizer. Lends a voice &amp; platform to anyone willing to engage. Also lends infinite opportunities &amp; challenges

@joeDmarti Those dark DOS computer programmers. SMH.
@MatthewWitt Yes! And it was heartbreaking when someone would die of dysentery even though I had no clue what that meant at the time.
@KJMediaDarling Smart. It's an instant mood-changer, eh?
@joeDmarti And why the heck couldn't Mary have gotten a cold instead of dysentery? Hummmm. Maybe the DOS game programers were jokers.
@joeDmarti Yes! Encyclopedia Britannica. My family set was missing a few letters which was always an issue when school reports were due.
@joeDmarti Those were the days! It was always so emotional when Mary broke her arm or when oxen wandered off. Simple fun.
@Kaufmak Yeah, there's no way it's the same without floppy disks and pressing the spacebar to continue! ;)
Warning. Do not Google The Oregon Trail game images like I did. A lovely time-stealing trip down DOS memory lane. https://t.co/n4Twot4DJl
@joeDmarti Exactly. There was ONE computer for about 45 kids so we got to play about once a month. Darn measles &amp; dysentery. Ha.

Social communication is a dialogue, not a monologue. Yet more &amp; more we show highlight reels instead of real life. Humanize &gt; Romanticize.
Be the type of person that when your feet hit the floor in the morning the devil says, "ahhh sh*t! They're up."

@emilymcdowell_ Stood in line to chat with ya yesterday, rockstar. Had to run but would love to connect soon. Loved, loved, loved your talk.
Can one 'write' in a library book without getting in trouble? Asking for a friend. 😉 Shhh https://t.co/t2ssRk2M8d
@timweston @jonathanfields @mrmoneymustache @emilymcdowell_ Thank you, Tim! I am in good company. Honored.
@KerriKingDurham Thanks, Kerri! Appreciate the photo too :)
@romeara1 Thank you, Rachael! It's powerful to think about what we can do with the concept. Micro actions make up macro results.
@mcdanielsara Thank you, Sara! Glad it resonated with you.
@mattragland Thank you, Again! Very cool. And so fast!
@Andrewlock Thank you, Andrew! Always appreciate the feedback. Hope to see you out here? Also, check out Why Not Now? on iTunes 3 weeks. ;)
It's unacceptable to litter in the physical world. Why not the virtual world? Don't let hatred clutter where you spend time. #WDS2016
@mattgersper Thank you and great meeting you! Sorry you couldn't get in but I can tell you all about it.
Grateful. Just delivered a talk at the World Domination Summit about the science of serotonin &amp; its impact on social media. Thx, #WDS2016!
Scientifically, acts of kindness boost serotonin in the giver, receiver &amp; everyone who witnesses the act. Kindness can go viral. #WDS2016
@mattragland Wow! I love your talent. Thanks for sketching &amp; sharing, Matt.
Did you go out of your way to help someone today? (Hint: the day isn't over yet &amp; you can answer later!)
@erinkbaileyy It's great to be brave when we address it directly but it's most important to be safe.
@erinkbaileyy @iamemilynolan Recently in Seattle, I told this man, in a voice full of healthy tension, it was unacceptable. Surprised him.
@erinkbaileyy Love your bravery and empowerment for others!
@erinkbaileyy Other than having the conversation, I'm not sure what the solution is going to be. @iamemilynolan was just talking about this.
@erinkbaileyy Wow! Full circle. I read your post last night after a run outside when I experienced the same thing you wrote about. Thank you
@jennramsay I've thoroughly enjoyed the conversation with the team, Jennifer! Thank you for hosting and I'm looking forward to the next.
@jayohwhy @SHAQ I remember that photo! Throwback. Great to meet you.
@mrxinu @LoisRussoNYC Hooray for books. 😉
@LoisRussoNYC I'm glad you enjoyed the read. Cheers to designing your own day!
@rachelpolish @Dolby Thank you for hosing me, Rachel! Great conversation within the Q&amp;A. Good group!
Micro actions combined generate macro results. I'm reminding myself of this daily lately ... sometimes hourly.
@erinkbaileyy 💥👊💥
@vntwit Well said!
@CoolhwipPoker @RealKidPoker Agreed. Fortunately, the climb ended fairly peacefully &amp; the message that you can't get away with this was sent
You're never too young to change the world. I'm so proud of &amp; inspired by this young girl: https://t.co/vjNvSFNJXV
@reallyjoco @RealKidPoker @realDonaldTrump It's beyond viral. Breaking news on every network. The message is he's not getting away with it.
This election is a window into an extremely bizarre time.
@jamescarew08 @Dolby @jbowpr Wouldn't have happened with out you. Thank you!
Just gave a talk @Dolby on the future of technology &amp; its impact on human behavior. Brands play a big role in this! https://t.co/nGnld7AF0c
@jbowpr @Dolby Thanks, Jennifer! I thoroughly enjoyed the comments &amp; questions. It will be exciting to see where you take the conversation.
@jaagrun @DigitalRoyalty @Dolby Great meeting everyone. I thoroughly enjoyed the conversation after my talk!

@sdc1982 Good point. Or Ninjas of the Caribbean?
@Paritrooper Okay. Pirates have more fun though?
@WildCardKing @GinnyFuchsUSA Arrrrrrrgh. I vote Pirates but I appreciate your rationale.
Very important question: Pirates or Ninjas. Which are tougher and why?
@chuckbox1969 Thanks for giving it a spin! Just starting or done?
Peace is achieved in a micro sense through every person you meet in your day. - @birbigs on @tferriss show (macro is made up of the micro)
@DigiDeleon @peterstringer For sure. Not saying it wasn't a smart move by Insta. Just fatigued. Yet, the simplicity of insta WAS gold.
@mistersterling My recent re-adoption of snapchat might be short-lived. Exactly what Insta wants. #OverCapacity
@DigiDeleon @peterstringer Thought of that too. My prob is that I was JUST starting to snap again after boycotting for awhile. What timing!
@peterstringer Very funny, Stringer. You might be right. Or maybe the Dakotas don't really exist? There's a theory on that.
Yes, I'm a huge fan of the power of social media. Yet there's a point of diminishing returns. People get fatigued. Only 24 hrs in a day.
@peterstringer Social media seems to jump the shark and then redeem itself over time. I'm a big fan but also only have 24 hrs in a day. :)
No instagram stories for me yet. Makes me anxious. Do I have the capacity for yet another social media bucket? Never thought I'd say that!
@stuffJWsays Score. I'll take all the book recommendations I can get. Thank you!

@JeffreyTimmons @RichardGrewar @BruceLeeFDN I happen to be headed to Calgary. Meeting Richard there. Any suggestions for Banff area?
@iamemilynolan @chelonione @Ski_Tamarack Don't think so. But other things!!
@united We haven't boarded yet. This doesn't seem accurate. 😁 Just letting ya know. Text updates need attention. 😉 https://t.co/RKTsK9QIBD
@terri_cole @iamemilynolan Just started listening. Thanks for sharing!
@JeffreyTimmons You bet! @RichardGrewar can help answer q's. He's my husband &amp; runs @BruceLeeFDN. Today is his b-day &amp; that's his campaign.
@cpoalmighty @mcuban He did say he's been tracking his sleep. You'll have to check out the podcast in August.
@akejabrams @Headspace It sure is, eh? @andypuddicombe &amp; team are on point.

@Y_Abdourazakou @united Hiking and exploring Banff as well as Lake Louise! And always 'working' on the road. If you call it that.
@egebhardt We didn't dissect the definition but knowing his personality it's definitely not a pushover if you know what I mean. ;)
@IslandBuggies It launches in Aug on iTunes. Not available quite yet. I'll be sure to spread the word when it goes live. Thanks for asking!

@NaoStern Nice! I forgot about that. I'd love to make it back to Italy soon. LOVED it. What's the best time to visit Milan?
@JeffreyTimmons Very cool!! Have you tried emailing your friends &amp; family? Just asking b/c it's worked the best for me to raise $. ;)
@Y_Abdourazakou @united More like an airport-hanger-outer. Ha. ;)

@michaelwolf Absolutely. When's your next episode coming out? ;) Keep them coming our way!
@michaelwolf Mike, I loved your podcast with Cuban. Great resource as I prep to speak with him today. Such great Q's. Thank you!
@justinweniger Ha. Are you generalizing about 'younger generations', Justin? ;) Check out @ErinSchrode if you haven't already. Impressive.
@justinweniger Ugh! Noooooo.
@PIASTANCHINA That's definitely true right now and unfortunate. What would/could change that? What's the catalyst need to be?
@ChrisOfCoins How do you define mainstream acceptance? # of users/fans? Revenue?
@spaceVtime @mcuban Fair. Between internet trolls and patent trolls, there are too many trolls on my list of Q's.
@PaulBaechtold @mcuban I'll explore. Tech bubble, NBA bubble ... Pretty sure we're all just in one giant #PokemonGo bubble.
@BrooksToday It launches mid-August. iTunes and I'll be promoting heavily ;) Thanks for asking!

@Stareagle There are obvious pros and cons to term limits. Don't you think?
@mgxvlden We don't have time to wait for that.
@Stareagle Agreed and also there's a time for some legislators to be moving on though.
How do we make politics more attractive to the younger generation of progressive thinkers? Policy changes? New term limits?

@GoodMangoes2war @espn @darrenrovell Good one. I'll ask. I'd love to know the answer as well b/c I'm trying to get better at interviewing.
@VeeckAsInWreck @espn @darrenrovell He's been known to unblock pretty easily too. He has a philosophy on blocking which I understand.
@VeeckAsInWreck @espn @darrenrovell Maybe he should. Quite a bit has changed since 2011. I think we'd all agree? ;)

@mistersterling Yep!
@heidibraun Yeah, sometimes we forget a My Little Pony can be just as fun and enjoyable as a unicorn.
@heidibraun I'm working on that. The main question is ... what should I write about? ;)
@mistersterling Solid point. Talk about perspective! Maybe we should rebel against the current 'time' structure/system. Start a new trend.
@mistersterling Well thank ya. Age is a % of awesomeness, right?

@atime4truth @SSIReview It's different when facebook algorithms decide what content is served &amp; what is not. And it's not just news.
@atime4truth @SSIReview Re: printed press, although there's still influence in what's printed, everyone will receive the same final product.
@atime4truth @SSIReview There's a difference b/c some people will never see some content &amp; only see certain content based on their profile.
@atime4truth @SSIReview The difference w/ this &amp; self expression is there is psychological manipulation involved via what algorithms serve.

@MiaCate I've been here!
@eThrive Entrapreneur for nearly 8 years. Angel investor for 2 years. Boat is 42 feet. ;)
@eThrive As soon as they possibly can. It's usually not possible in the beginning but there's a tipping point when it must happen.
@eThrive And it's important for entrepreneurs to focus on what they're uniquely qualified to do as soon as they can. Vs. wear all hats.
@eThrive My advice for entrepreneurs: Create a business that represents the intersection of where your passion, purpose &amp; skill collide.
@DanielleWarby Have a great day. Love the zest.
@eThrive Well thank ya. How can I help? Jokes onboard. ;)
@MassageForPros I can see that happening a bit but it's pretty simple to just head out. (Haven't used PITA used in a bit. I'm stealing it!)

@eebzzub Poor thing. Where in Australia? My favorite place is Byron Bay. So beautiful.
@KyleWGreene You're welcome. And I'm not but hopefully things are going well on that end!
@vikreds I believe where purpose, passion &amp; skill collide, happiness resides. Seek there? And be kind to yourself! We so often forget that.

@marcystews Inspiration is a two-way street! Thank you. I get so much out of this. It almost feels selfish.
@ItIsSaraWithAnH I feel the most confident when I'm exercising my creative muscles, surrounded by an awesome team &amp; have a sense of purpose.
@ItIsSaraWithAnH Interesting Q. Those moments have been balanced with a ton of humility. Sometimes unsolicited humility. ;)
@marcystews Also, for breaking through creative walls, Big Magic by @GilbertLiz &amp; Originals by @AdamMGrant are great!
@marcystews Going on long walks &amp; listening to NPR's TED Radio Hour is great. Walk somewhere new &amp; listen to something outside your norm.
@_janiceclark Best PR agency in LA for a sports company? That would be @StantonCompany led by the brilliant @amykstanton!

Being excellent earns an audience, keeping them requires something more personal.
@BarrettAll @rtacademy @shortyawards Thanks, Jeff and everyone who participated! #RealTalk
@BarrettAll Be where your feet are. #RealTalk
@BarrettAll Q6: It’s too bad that many innovative leaders feel they can make more change in the world by NOT being President. #RealTalk
@BarrettAll Q6: An innovative, proven leader who can surround themselves w/ experienced, trusted advisors. @mcuban or Zuckerberg? #RealTalk
@BarrettAll  Q5: Hillary &amp; Bernie. Yet I cringed when Madeleine Albright did this https://t.co/HfvgyW3szT. Again, out of touch. #RealTalk
@BarrettAll A slogan is for advertising &amp; it's also a Scottish Highland war cry. I'd stay away from both. #RealTalk
@BarrettAll Unfortunately, with this campaign it's as if candidates are playing not to lose vs. playing to win. #RealTalk
@BarrettAll Also, to demonstrate more care in the voice of the brand. (And less spelling errors.) #RealTalk
@BarrettAll Q3: Listen &amp; learn. Candidates seem so out of touch. Ex: They way they speak about technology is concerning. #RealTalk
@DavidAPortney @BarrettAll Trump is entertainment.
@Osphere @shortyawards @BarrettAll Ha. I get it now. Yes, 'on board.'
@BarrettAll Show more of who the person is behind the personality. Focus on a two-way dialogue vs. the loud monologue. #RealTalk
Q2: Voters want to connect. Candidates need to be more relatable &amp; show more human qualities. https://t.co/sLKjGItVJW #RealTalk @BarrettAll
Q2: Why do I think all candidates need to humanize their brand? Because Humans connect with humans, not politicians. #RealTalk @BarrettAll
@BarrettAll Q1: Trump &amp; Bernie are not your typical politician &amp; people are craving a different approach. #RealTalk

You can color outside the lines without crossing the line. Disruption and destruction have two different outcomes.
@lannadelgrey Yeah, agreed. She's physically present. I just finished her new book. Hope that comment was a one-off mistake.
@lannadelgrey Rightfully so. I've been holding my tongue about her comments &amp; some of Madeleine Albright's too. They sound so out of touch.

Deep change happens when the less powerful speak as much as they listen &amp; the more powerful listen as much as they speak. @GloriaSteinem
