Okay Los Angelenos!  Maybe it was too hard to find, but google this: location + wayne's world + mu store and find my 2 tix!
@LindyBooth Why thank you Miss Lindy! You certainly do have this twitter thing down already!
@DonovanPraigg Aww, thanks! Too bad you're not here to find my 2 tix and come to my show!
Last clue for location of 2 free tix to my Dec 4 concert: Dana Carvey rocked out for real here! Take a pic when u find em! Behind WW poster.
Clue #3 to win tix: The music in this scene was not cleared for license and had to be changed.
Clue #2 to find the location of 2 free tix to my Dec. 4 LA concert: In the film, there is a key scene that involves music...
I'm going to have to make my clues a little harder.By Thursday you're gonna wanna keep the answer to yourself so u can find the tix!
Clue #1 I did a film about 2 guys that run a cable-access show from their basement.
Giving 2 tix to my Dec 4 8pm show in LA! I'm hiding 'em so watch here for clues all week around 11am PST! Okay, so I'm a lil late :-).
