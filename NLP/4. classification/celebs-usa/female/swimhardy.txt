Lady Gaga’s speech at the Grammys last night was amazing. Like artists, athletes know the burden of mental health issues too well. We are perceived as some of the “strongest” people on the planet, but it doesn’t make you weak to ask for help. We’re all in this together. https://t.co/MPMeToilMe

I know I sound crazy, but NO SUPPLEMENTS are safe. Read your labels, if it doesn’t say “nutritional facts” vs “supplemental facts,” you’re responsible for the ingredients. NOT worth the risk as an athlete. https://t.co/DIdblBQAKz
@Sport_Nutricia @swimswamnews Or finding natural nutrients rather than taking supplements. I broke 12 WR’s without a single supplement.
