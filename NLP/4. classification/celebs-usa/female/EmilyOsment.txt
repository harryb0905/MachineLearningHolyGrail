@jim_jimlipp @MrJonCryer 40
@bc_candles more so about the age. young enough to be lithe and old enough to know what they’re doing
@jbragg1977 @MrJonCryer they don’t turn around, it’s just one single stampede of death. like the lion king!
@WarriorsLoves oh at least twenty i’m thinking
My uber rating isn’t at 5.0 and it bothers me endlessly. However, last night I was casually discussing a hypothetical revenge murder in the back of the car and was using extreme detail of just how many horses I would use to trample someone. So maybe it isn’t a glitch on the app.
@nwkeyes i will take it thank u
@freddyscott love you fred fred !
love you thank you!!!!! https://t.co/agcOeHi84l

I have long since grown out of bickering with my sibling, however the one thing that pleases me dearly is just how much it aggravates @HaleyJoelOsment that i keep my cups in a large drawer in my kitchen. Hope you’re having fun in sundance come home soon!!!
Currently in my purse there is a ziplock bag of dog food and a ziplock bag of clip in hair extensions and you best believe I grabbed the wrong one when I dropped off my dog for boarding. Joe’s going to be the talk of the town this weekend. 💁🏼‍♀️

@itsninaj1 totally taller than i am talented
@ironheart_9 wait who is mikey
@LouiLae neither did i, but i figured it out a little bit at a time. don’t cut your own bangs. don’t date someone who honks their horn upon arrival. don’t change yourself for someone temporary when you are yourself forever, and totally take your vitamins
@JerryDaponte my facialist asked me if i have ever considered botox last week to get rid of my forehead wrinkles, but thank you!
@itsninaj1 I am 5’3” but thank you!!

Headed to LACMA and then arriving to learn LACMA doesn’t do rain. There was actual security protecting us from three inches of water. Two guys! With night sticks! My friend flew from rainy portland to rainy LA but at least we can laugh about it. https://t.co/pIpU4WXAy2
I wish there was a way to alert an instagram ad that yes, it worked, I bought the matching pajama set last week you can stop advertising it now. I’m literally wearing it at this very moment. IT WORKED! GO AWAY! Fine MAYBE my mom wants one too!!

@Keither37 awesome! they sound nothing like that song so i hope you still dig!
@DisneySchroeder @TheAdamGoldberg all new songs. nothing from those days.  hence the new name.
@wolfielarsson it’s not available yet, HH won’t be out till this summer most likely. few songs lined up for release before that
Just got my first single mastered as my new alias BlueBiird. Please welcome ‘Black Coffee Morning’ into your hearts this February and stay up to date with my new project by signing up for our mailing list  BlueBiirdMusicOfficial@gmail.com cover by @TheAdamGoldberg coming soon
@lexmesr February !
@lexmesr right now we’re deciding whether to release it before ‘Sailor’ or after ‘Good Girl’ but definitely after ‘Black Coffee Morning’ 😉 #BlueBiird

@claire_hickeyy @TaylorMelissa11 i did not get myself........ i don’t understand. it’s almost like buzzfeed doesn’t watch me get dressed every morning. and if this camera crew isn’t buzzfeed then ...who are they....

When I was a kid I saw a picture of Rod Serling sitting on a ladder and writing on top of his upright piano. Does anyone know where I can find this photo? Maybe it wasn’t in fact Rod Serling? Does anyone know what i’m talking about? Heeelp.
@danibearsays they are they’re just dainty
Netflix wants me to watch The Christmas Chronicles with Kurt Russell more than they want me to breathe or  nourish myself, so I won’t do it.   Maybe tomorrow.
happy birthday, muck! @MikeSleathDRUMS lucky to have you in my life for the past decade. Always proud of you/impressed by you, but honestly more so impressed by @bradyleffler who managed to make us look not half bad against this seemingly seedy background. https://t.co/4HGVr4KUM2

@Markus_Hill @Shar77mee @hallmarkmovie oh you already know i’m in
Overwhelming love for our Hallmark movie last night. Thank you for watching, posting about it, and letting us start off Christmas for you. Glad to be apart of a channel that makes movies that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Sometimes we really need those flicks. ❤️

I’m not addicted to my phone, but I did just say “hey Siri, put on the kettle”. Needless to say, you do in fact need a human for that.
@sagittariusnake Figuring out how to watch six hours of tv in one day took quite a bit of work tbh

@JMHarrington91 @itsissJessss this person was kindly providing explanation and you told her to f off? let’s all try to be a little nicer to each other today!
@itsissJessss @JMHarrington91 Thanks you for clarifying this tweet Jess! Felt it pretty obvious I meant no sense of entitlement with it. And you’re right! Australia doesn’t have pennies like we do in America and she didn’t really know how to use them. I think we all can agree we have a change purse somewhere!
@TheAdamGoldberg @realDonaldTrump how about we blame climate change, you know, that thing you don’t believe in.
@MiaSerafino my exact thoughts. or the creature from spirited away.
You know you’re stressed when you let out a light chuckle and your whole back cracks in response.
. @MalloryJansen : “i’ve got all this brass colored sh*t i can’t get rid of”   Me: “you mean pennies?”  Mal: “yeah, those”  😳

also it’s “you’re” https://t.co/JR1D0jyjES
probably. but mostly it means my brain hopefully formed a little differently, I got outside more and I wasn’t constantly comparing myself to other people I saw on the internet. It was a gift. https://t.co/JR1D0jyjES
Thirty minutes into Eighth Grade and I keep having to pause it and take breaks because it’s giving me so much anxiety. There is no amount of money that would convince me to go back and do middle school again, and I didn’t even have social media then. Terrifying.

flight attendant just looked me straight in my eyeballs and asked me if i was through enjoying my orange juice.  enjoying my orange juice.  enjoying.   “wow, I THOROUGHLY enjoyed that nancy, please leave the glass here as a reminder of it!”

In better news, I saw some cheese at the grocery store that expires in November, so it’s fall bitches!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The only retort I had was “wow sir you are not very friendly.”  wow. sir.  you are not.  very friendly?!??  jesus.
Stepped one foot out of line to grab a lemon at the store and the man behind me stepped over my basket and CLOSED THE GAP. I said “excuse me I think I was in front of you” twice and he pretended not to hear or see me as I dragged my basket out from under him.
“So. You can ride your absolutely BLASPHEMOUS and REPUGNANT “Bird Scooter” the wrong way on a busy street without a helmet, but I can’t ride my motorized, unlicensed, not street legal vintage scooter at a safe speed in the bike lane??” she said to the kettle.
me at dinner, knife raised at friend  *owner approaches table*  ....oh....hello. how is. everything?  “oh sorry, i was just pretending to murder her. can i get some more water?”
this movie made me call my mom and tell her i love her. get your tickets!! https://t.co/YO00wpiJ6o
Last night I had a dream I was eating at a sushi restaurant down the street and Obama came in to pick up an order to go. The restaurant then charged a 66% tax on my meal because of it. “I didn’t even meet him!” I screamed. “Your sashimi is now $80” she said. Then I paid with yen.
thanks for the back massage, los angeles! #earthquake
@kymwhitley i’m good! you guys okay? ❤️
@MiaSerafino i took my turbie twist off in case i had to run outside. that was the extent of my evac skills
after watching Captain Fantastic:  “Dad, why didn’t you raise me in the forest?”  Dad: “Because I can’t get the NFL out there.”  T R U E
@Mrtimrock @kymwhitley @RexLee_ @aimeecarrero absolutely!
But I did conquer a three mile hike today. The incline was moderately sloped and I stopped to give the dog water like nine times when I’m positive he was already completely hydrated. So. You know. We’re all just doing our best.
Sometimes instead of working out I just watch a bunch of videos on the internet of girls killing it in the gym and i’m so tired after I just call it a day. You did enough for the both of us FitGurlJessicaGymMonkey or whatever your handle is. Good work. Where are the cookies.
@WhatsupDanny UGHHHHHHHHHH DAMN YOU
Met a Young &amp; Hungry fan at the dodger game last night and she approached me with “what’s up bitch!” Hey. If I don’t know you, please don’t call me bitch. If you do know me, it’s ‘Ms. Bad Bitch’ only. Thank you.
My brother @HaleyJoelOsment is on the newest ep of my favorite podcast ‘R U Talking REM RE: Me?’ Which is where I delightfully found out he was willing to BAIL on our joint bbq at my house last month to be on the show. But honestly, I get it. @mradamscott @ScottAukerman
@RexLee_ hahaha i did it on purpose!
@smilelove180 i thought it covered a lot. white people trying to adopt black culture. big corporations, consumerism and pop culture literally turning us into slaves. and generally “if you ignore the problem long enough you get used to it”
Saw Sorry To Bother You last night and somehow didn’t have nightmares about centaurs. They very much hit you over the head with the symbolism, I feel like if you watched it with the sound off and without your glasses you would still get it. Great commentary on our current America
@RexLee_ never don’t do these type of tweets

Mercury retrograde is an optical illusion. We all understand that, right? If you have time to reorder your life according to what Mercury is doing you have time to read an astronomy book. Oo I am saucy this morning.

Google Maps is so linked up when i’m driving I can look at directions on my phone, the screen in my car, and my apple watch vibrates when it’s time to make a turn and you can bet one hundo p (100%) I will still miss my exit.

Special shout out to mental health. Your own sanity is so much more important than anything else. Weird seeing this season’s young and hungry from over a year ago when I was 20lbs heavier and deeply sad. Get yourself right. Get yourself first. It all falls in line. 🤗

@sadowski23 not surprised by any of this hahaha
He asked me to come over and watch a movie. When I got there he was watching a full series of a show he was on by himself and asked me to wait till commercials to talk. I think I was 19? #datinghorrorstories
@EmOsmentTeam @MikeSleathDRUMS no way
@MikeSleathDRUMS my favorite ex boyfriend is probably laughing very very hard at these
@Burgley yeah and i was also in high school and stupid
Doing this #datinghorrorstories series because first of all, it’s hilarious, and second of all, it’s better to try and fail then not try at all. I regret nothing and neither should you. Plus, if you don’t have bad you don’t know what good looks like.
He went through my closet and said “no, no, no, no, oh my god is this from Old Navy? no. do you have any prints in your wardrobe? I’m going to take you shopping” and then cheat on you. #datinghorrorstories
One time, on a date gone very wrong, we both made excuses to go home early and then accidentally ran into each other at the same bar an hour later. #datinghorrorstories

Just filled up my car at Shell and it was the same price as the flight I just booked to San Francisco. So either I got a great deal on Southwest or gas prices are insane. JK it’s both. (great tweet, emily!) (thanks, i know)
you must have mistaken me for my mother sitting next to me, but thank you https://t.co/Vy6POujwmo

@popelijah1 yeah but like. it was a joke?
“I paid 120,000 to be told to go read Jane Austen and then I DIDNT” -@mulaney on college in Kid Gorgeous is MEEEEEEEE
i can easily live without my iphone. i just won’t be able to unlock my house, change the thermostat, turn on my tv, my lights, or listen to music. but it’s okay, there’s always sitting in the dark and playing thumb war with myself.
@MikeSleathDRUMS this photo of you actually made me lol
@kylie_robison i don’t remember this but i completely believe it
@dnmurph99 yeah this is pretty mundane. they have good shrimp though.
@Tshimanga369 pass
@devbostick yahoo! uke party!!
@crickerr no that’s the only one that’s actually okay. you can’t say ‘avo’ or ‘Cali’ but ‘guac’ is totally allowed
The same people who say “avo” instead of “avocado” also say “Cali” instead of “California.” Oddly enough they’re all in the same acting class too.
happy thursday from your friend emily, who will always tell you the truth https://t.co/E0ZwLaLA1Y
There’s a big difference between “you looked good out there on the dance floor” and “saw you out there on the dance floor.” I know because I got the latter last night. 💃🏼
I heard Beyoncé rehearsing her set all week on the Sony lot so basically I can say I was at Coachella right? My friend saw one of the twins drop a bottle on the ground and no one picked it up they just gave her a fresh bottle instantly from NOWHERE. You can’t make that up.
@ChaseHayley @Dodgers omg omg omg omg
I just spent three hilarious weeks with this ridiculous human. You would never know we took this at four am last night. Chris Koch you’re everyone’s hero/mascot and one hell of a director. Thank you!!! ❤️ https://t.co/3CdRkmyt8u

@JoshRamsay omg back when i thought “gonna” was spelled “gyunnah” 2011 was 26 years ago, right?
@teachrlois rancho santa margarita, lois!
I just used cruise control for the first time. I should clarify-in my CAR. Can’t control all the cruisin I do in my actual life. Why do you follow me.
@MalloryJansen you f-ing wish
@freddyscott I never knew this was a thing i needed so bad until right now
@MalloryJansen really enjoying our mirrored head in hand pictures.
@MalloryJansen i’m right here, mallory
Can I read “I’ll Be Gone In The Dark” and not be terrified alone in my house at night? Asking for a friend. Signed, someone who didn’t watch The Shining until age 23. Once again, ASKING FOR A FRIEND, OKAY??
@MalloryJansen @BirdRide I said I was sorry Mallory, jesus...
I read a lot of books on acting in college and none of them spoke to me like this one. And it’s not even a book about acting! “If your home life is sane, it allows you to go insane in your work.” TRUE STORY. Thank you, @BryanCranston. Enjoying it to the point of destruction. https://t.co/3NCu5G9ZhO
i am deeply concerned by the amount of people that think i’m serious right now
I love when people subtly change the ambient music in their store to the Hannah Montana theme song when I walk in. It will never get old. Seriously, please never stop. Really. I love it. I always find it funny. I’ll come back to your store all the time. Like. All the time.
@freddyscott that was pretty good

I don’t early morning or late night text unless I see that you’ve recently liked something on instagram. It’s called stalking courtesy. You all do it. I’m just the first one to say it.
A couple rats moved into my attic during construction at my house, but I don’t think im going to use a typical extermination method. Just going to psychologically break them down by playing every speech Trump has ever given on a constant circuit until they leave voluntarily.
@0828Maria @aimeecarrero YES!!!
. @aimeecarrero I could have texted you this but I think it’s too funny not to share. should have grabbed you and been like “she’s not for sale because she’s the only one that pays the rent around here even though I work for a millionaire!”
. @aimeecarrero the other day at target I saw someone buying a 3ft tall doll version of you as Elena. I thought it was hilarious cuz 3ft tall is such a strange height choice. Somewhere btween ‘American Girl Doll’, ‘Life-Size Barbie’ &amp; real Aimee lives Elena of Avalor. &amp; she cute

@taylabatchford haha no, probably could have worded that better. in my dreams I am.
@ChristopherJCy1 you know a “whole” lot. and never did I claim all men were this way. important to not disregard red flag with anyone. good, bad, male or female. it’s more of a trust your gut type of thing.
Finally watching the globes. What an important and terrifying time for women. Why does it take disaster to elicit change? Rest assured the truth always reveals itself. Watching so many women stand together in unity with such bravery is so powerful. Thank you for leading the way.
There is no better arm workout than driving a classic car with no power steering around Los Angeles. Also carrying the weight of a dark secret. Also push ups.

Parents, explain to your children what's happening. They can change this. The future CAN be kind. It MUST be kind or we will not survive.
@prtendimnothere because I can't bring myself to type his name

@animalxer42 so being trans is a physical problem? seems to me it's a solution to a lifelong problem of being someone else.

So many Mother's Day commercials in between watching Handmaid's Tale and now I can't stop thinking about what Trump is getting Melania.
Sorry Handmaid's Tale* this show freaks me out. Also where is Clive Owen. This is Children of Men the sequel, right?
I need an entire show just about the creepy pregnant lady with one eye in the Handmaiden's Tale. And it has to be a comedy.
