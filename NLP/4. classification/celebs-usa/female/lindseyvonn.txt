Today I won a bronze medal that felt like gold. It was an amazing day that I will never forget. Thank you to everyone who supported me and helped me get to this point. Love you all ❤️🙏🏻
More of myself....however there’s only one thing I can guarantee;  I will give everything I have tomorrow. Count on it.
Tomorrow I will push out of the starting gate in what will most likely be my last Olympic Downhill race. I’m trying to enjoy the moment as much as I can and I am thankful to share this race with such amazing teammates. I know everyone expects a lot from me, and I expect even...
I’m visualizing the course. I’m old but not that old 😜 https://t.co/7i4Y1oF9rp
Very well writen Tim. Thank you 🙏🏻 https://t.co/68By4jDS7W
Beyond disappointing that my family flew 6,000 miles to watch me ski and they aren’t even allowed to watch my downhill training runs. Access has been denied to all families and spectators. @fisalpine tried to help but access was still denied. Sad.

Frustrating to be so close to the podium and to have made such a big mistake...but that’s ski racing. I’m proud of the way I skied and how I attacked the course. I gave it my all and came up short. That’s life. Now it’s on to the Downhill! 💪🏻
Well...start is already delayed an hour due to strong winds. Hopefully it will die down so we can have a fair race 🙏🏻
Tomorrow it’s game time! I will give it everything I have with no regrets. This is for my Grandpa! I have bib # 1 and start time is 11am here so 9pm est. Watch it live on @nbc . #allformyGrandpa 🙏🏻❤️ #allornothing

We are not funded at all by the government. We rely on donations and sponsors to support our programs. Which is why I am such an advocate for promoting ski racing and I continue to help fundraisers for our team. I also have a foundation. #fyi https://t.co/KRLjvtXs9s
Finally on a new plane! Have to give a BIG thank you to all of the flight attendants for working overtime to stay on this flight. They all volunteered and we wouldn’t be able to fly without them! Now let’s hope we actually take off tonight🙏🏻
Yes, that’s what I’m trying to get to 🙏🏻 https://t.co/6qXRwCtd8p
Well we are now off the plane... they are trying to find a new plane and hope to take off in an hour...🙈 how many hours, door to door, will it take me to get to Seoul?
Well hopefully we get to Korea....apparently we don’t have the right documents to fly??? About 2 hours on the plane so far and just siting at the gate. Some Germans and Italians on the plane too. 🤷🏼‍♀️@lufthansa #canweflynowplease
Yeah for sure! https://t.co/gpBqcchCoY
Ok so this is weird...the poor guy next to me wasn’t feeling well so he deplaned....was it something I said?🤷🏼‍♀️ (but I didn’t say a peep 🙊) #feelbetterdude

Since I’m on the plane heading to Korea, I’d like to share why these Olympics are so special to me. My grandfather recently passed away and I will be competing for him, I will make him proud. Here is the last visit I had with him before he died. https://t.co/9TXAC9zfGi
Totally not awkward all when the guy next to me on the plane is trying to take a pic and his flash accidentally goes off and I catch him... 🙈

Sorry. I get emotional sometimes. Thanks for listening
I think about the loss of my Grandpa every day, but today I miss him more. I wish he was here with me. I wish he could watch me in the Olympics in S Korea where he served in the war. I just wish he was here. I want to make him proud.
It’s crazy that 60 seconds can tell so much about my life; my family, my love for skiing, my success, my pain, my will to never give up...but in the end, I’m just a kid that loves to ski fast. Thanks for making me cry @NBCOlympics 🙏🏻❤️
https://t.co/f7nsLWiZQw
Oh and I forgot... Ricky Bobby! https://t.co/sbOf1e3yLE
Bro that’s what I was doing. Jeez Louise. Read my other tweets. I agree with you, each GOAT should be recognized bc there isn’t just one, there are so many incredible athletes that have inspired us. https://t.co/ewlZzzxNdF
Hahah well they are the greatest male and female athletes in their sport but I don’t think there should be just one. Both should be recognized.... maybe we should say OOTGOAT ;) https://t.co/6OgPywObdd
There are so many it’s hard to name them all. Of course Wayne, Valentino Rossi, Michael Schumacher, Pelé, Ronaldo....it’s a long long list. https://t.co/AEEsh9Z0GI
More GOATs; Steffi Graf, Simone Biles, Michael Phelps, Tiger Woods, Katie Ledecky, LeBron James, Tom Brady, Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson, Bill Russell, Billie Jean King....and so on. It’s not always about the number but about the impact they had on sport and the world
I think there is a long list of GOATs; Roger Federer, Michael Jordan, Serena Williams, Muhammad Ali, Annika Sörenstam, Usain Bolt, Ingemar Stenmark... and many more. I think Serena and Rog are the greatest tennis players of this generation though. https://t.co/2KcwPfssIf
Close...but I tore my ACL for the 2nd time right before the Sochi Olympics, not an MCL sprain... but otherwise 👍🏻. You just can’t beat the person that never gives up :) https://t.co/MLnkf38VL1
And that my friends is why Roger is my hero and a LEGEND!!! 100% the GOAT!!! No question about it!!! 20x grand slam titles 6x Ausi Opens! #lifeinspiration @rogerfederer 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
This match is giving me major anxiety 🙈 come on Roger!!!! #AusOpen @rogerfederer

RIP Warren. You’ve done so much for the skiing and I’m privileged to have met you. 🙏🏻 https://t.co/f1NawmmjRw
In all likelihood, yes. I would love to ski longer but unfortunately I don’t think my body will hold up. So I’m preparing for this to be my last games. https://t.co/1qnMNkrROB
I’m not dating anyone, just married to the game. Skiing is my one and only until after these Olympics. No distractions, have to put myself first this time. https://t.co/gV3x3wblPY

Oldie but goodie! I know the feeling! Let’s go TB!!! #teamUA https://t.co/ili1cUjrZ2
Also tough race considering most of the athletes are still qualifying for the Olympics and wind is dictating results. Still, it’s an outside sport and all we can do is our best. Can’t change it unfortunately
Well an unlucky day...never had such a strong wind gust in a race ever in my life. Oh well, can’t change it. I’ll save the good luck for February I guess. Now go USA!!!

Another tough day and even tougher conditions, but it’s not February so I’m not stressed. I’ve been waiting for these Olympics for 8 years so being healthy is my #1 priority. Next weekend is cortina. Should be a little easier on my knee 😜
Yup that’s the plan. But we MUST inspect tomorrow before the training run! Otherwise it’s not safe. https://t.co/ZVCJElnWs5
I agree. Tim is very knowledgeable on ski racing and I’m sure he’ll write an amazing article on Shiffin, and well deserved. https://t.co/ITYhq9XHqf
Solid result today in tough conditions. Lost a lot of time on the bottom but generally happy to have made it down safely. Downhill training run and race in the same day tomorrow. Should be interesting. #focusedonFebruary
It always amazes me how quickly people forget. Thankfully there’s plenty more to come.
Congrats @MikaelaShiffrin and @MarcelHirscher on an amazing weekend!

Unfortunately I will not be able to race today. I am extremely disappointed but my biggest goal this season is the Olympics and I need to take care of myself now so I can be ready for next week, and more importantly, for February. As always, thank you for the well wishes ❤️🙏🏻
Our @usskiteam doctor checked me out and no imaging is needed 🙌🏻 just need the joint and the muscles to calm down so I can move again.
Looks like i have an acute facet (spinal joint) dysfunction. I got compressed on the 6th gate and my back seized up. Rested and had a lot of therapy tonight. We will see how I feel tomorrow and then decide if I will race. Thanks for the support 🙏🏻

Unfortunately after getting food poisoning and crashing today I don't feel healthy enough to safely race tomorrow so I will not be starting😔
Low energy but feeling better. Nothing some anti-nausea meds can't fix! Snow looks great today too so I'll be racing :) will do my best
Hopefully I'll feel better tomorrow. #tomorrowisanewday
I'm sorry I couldn't attend the bib draw tonight. I got food poisoning or some stomach bug and have been puking all afternoon. 🤒😕
I didn't race because I thought the conditions weren't safe.It has nothing to do with wanting to race the men. Safety should be the priority https://t.co/xKMPNgXY1m
Lowering the start was a good move. However, I don't think it will change much. Snow is too soft. Sad for #Denise who can't restart 😔
Well that's enough. I'm not racing today. This is not safe. Please stop this @fisalpine
