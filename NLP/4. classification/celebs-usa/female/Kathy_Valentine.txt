@John_Royal thanks John. reading
@TimothyHorrigan I thought the amount of white men looked a little off on that stage for that particular film. reading the @esquire piece now
now I have to go read about the controversy surrounding the best picture.  good job julia roberts wrapping up an awkward end
another great speech! alfonso cuaron. I rarely watch the #oscars but I'm so glad I did tonight. Loved so many of the films, want to see the ones I missed.
Olivia Colman RULES. How adorable was that acceptance? Amazing performance in The Favourite
never liked that Shallow song much but that performance won me over to it. @ladygaga killed
i love this #Oscars2019 because of how much the GOPS would hate it üòú #representation
@megsamthx no, the usually perfect Jennifer Hudson
@natasharothwell horrible song and she's gorgeous but yikes yeah. loudly pitchy
@JeffReddKross I didn‚Äôt know that! We need to have an Egypt convo! Best adventure
@MollyJongFast such a nasty disposition. I wonder if she'd even recognize joy.
@VincentConnare No I went by myself to Egypt. Huge adventure
@TheDebr1 @mikelrouse @MotuDP Yes indeedy!
@IAmTheRealNickP @NeumannBerlin @rodemics MUSIC SOUNDTRACK
@Nox_Amicus @mikelrouse @MotuDP DP has tons of sounds and surprised at how good the Apple stuff is on this new computer. I ran PT on Mavericks system for several years, wasn't supposed to work and finally didn't. Couldn't open one track. Ran to Apple store and started over.
wall hanging is from trip to Egypt, a tent canvas like a lot of the stalls use. I wanted to bring one home desperately! looked at tons, most had gorgeous Islamic designs, but this one had traditional Egyptian motifs. Weighs a ton, lugged it around the desert for 2 wks. worth it.
@Nox_Amicus @mikelrouse @MotuDP I have built in tech support and expertise w/Mikel and we will be collaborating a lot. But also Logic looked like glorified GarageBand to me, and I always feel very confused with that program. I'm liking DP a lot, but miss being more adept as I was with PT
For those interested, very simple but effective set up: iMac- still waiting to add more RAM, DP working well w/stock Mac. API mic pre, UA 1176, @neumannberlin vintage U67, a few ‚Äò57s and @Rodemics NT1. Need to add my prior Waves bundle from PT, right now enjoying the DP plug ins
Finally got my new home studio set up thanks @mikelrouse for converting me to @motuDP which I‚Äôm now learning since #ProTools isn‚Äôt compatible w my new Mac&amp;OS. Ready to make a soundtrack! https://t.co/u5uwWs4mPq
@NekoCase i use MS Word for Mac, broke down and got the license after using for years and I'm happy with it.

@clairec345 I liked her since the Kavanaugh hearings. To be honest I‚Äôd never heard of her before that
@Chris_Huff His declaration was great. Like her SO much
@den_down_unda I really really like her and think she‚Äôd make a great president. But Trump has poisoned her candidacy from his bully pulpit. I can‚Äôt stand it but I think he has managed to fuck things up for her
@ThatTonyH Yeah I just thought I‚Äôd have an inclination by now!
@linle23 I really liked Bernie‚Äôs candidacy declaration, but man I‚Äôm feeling the same way as you

@adamcbest omg this is frighteningly true
@joecoscarelli @melenar 2nd - when I was young, I had the support of many male musicians I looked up to. It was incredibly validating. I can't even imagine the VERY different course my career would have taken had these guys used my interest &amp; passion for music as an access point to hustle me for sex
@joecoscarelli 1st, thank u Joe and @melenar for this story. I hope the women you spoke to can withstand the gaslighting and assholes who are surely going to rain upon them. Everyone who is so inclined, please send mega support to counteract the fallout.

@ElizabethofR many people develop tinnitus after taking meds. I didn't know this until I got it
@ElizabethofR crowdsource asking is my last resort usually. I talked to 3 doctors and researched for months and came here to supplement what I've found
@ElizabethofR I did.
@ElizabethofR maybe it was both then. I had a bone graft oral surgery, I took the pain med a little, and the antibiotic, but it gave me heartburn and I stopped. The pain lasted 2 wks and I have a very high pain threshold. The tinnitus started somewhere in there.
@rodstewart absolutely right @rodstewart ‚ù§Ô∏è
@dreamwithfaith just making sure!! lol
@BruceBrager no I haven't made his acquaintance! good trivia though
@Mazdafun2 @TheWho thanks!
@dreamwithfaith that's actually great to hear. mine feels louder lately and I think I've been slacking on the water. thanks. wait, you mean the more water depleted you are, it's worse right?
@mikecher How much do you take? I have some in a multi but it‚Äôs prob not enough
@schigodi Yes I‚Äôve been told our brains adapt to it. I‚Äôm much better than I was, and pretty much accept it but look (calmly) for solutions. Nice to hear from others who have it
@JohnKelly I LOVE THE SHOW!! so happy you are seeing it. So much joy.
@DavidRiley62 really! ok, I will make it a practice. thank you
@automatics1im @mollie1961 I haven't heard of pink/brown noise, I'll check that out. I use a combo of my Oasis Air filter on high and a water sound app.
@csonsini thank you for this link!
@DavidRiley62 I'll get some zinc and GB. Did that you tube thing, it helps for about 5 seconds!
@pegkeady always had perfect hearing, this happened right after antibiotics, ones I'd never had before. Tinnitus is linked to many different causes. And, yes youre right, Ive reduced sugar and caffiene drastically. Still there.
@Moonspinner55 yes I did that. I didn't have any wax build up though
@RobLowe It's so tragic. I can't imagine from your perspective
@jenbourgoyne But the sound is inside my body, not outside. I don't understand how headphones could help tinnitus?
@ChazReddBear @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump We got a free pass. Can you imagine what Trumps deranged speech would have been like??
@Sauvignon64 like a few drops in each ear? regular HP or special kind?
@SeanRobbins13 yes daytimes I keep busy and stay distracted. I used to drive in silence, now I need music. And night times are a drag. I stay up until I'm exhausted so I can fall asleep. My sympathies to you
@Bjornapoor I used to do TM now I can't meditate. But I do some neck exercises etc.
@realcbj @TheRyanAdams it's not a cut and dried symptom of any one thing. Linked to that, also: viral, stress, toxic metals, actual damage (I've played loud music since age of 16) thank you for reply!

Twitter friends: Asking. After a round of antibiotics a few months ago I ended up w/tinnitus. Sounds like a swarm of cicadas in my head 24/7. Done due diligence Google research, talked to docs. Won't do pharma/surgery. Anyone know of nature help w/this condition?

@jpierce0101 @BettyBuckley @Acosta He didn't do anything to her. His arm was up as he turned from her repeated grasps and came down as he made his point talking, then he said "Pardon me, Ma'am" when it made contact with hers. Zero aggression on his part. If she'd been harmed, Trump would've squawked on the spot.
@KeatonPatti these bot scripts are the best thing in the entire twitter. I don't know how to make a bot do anything, but keep doing it, please.

@mactavish I looked on gop influencer twitter. they show a close up of his arm moving down on her arm while she's trying to wrest the mic away. And they are calling it a karate chop
*all I can do

@nowhitenonsense @deray it's abortion. that's why Christian white women vote R. The other abhorrent policies could sway them, but very difficult to change someone's mind about "baby killing" narrative
@JRaney213 @rgay It's abortion. @lizzwinstead has been saying this for years. It's the single issue, not a wedge issue. This is why white women vote R.
we need to think a long game. it's what the gops have done since Reagan. We see the problems in this country, the underlying cause, the racism, fear, lack of education. Abortion is a HUGE issue, what drives many white women to vote R. Big probs to address before change comes
@rgay Same in TXSen race. I thought change would come by working to GOTV for new voters. Now I see it's about changing the mindset of these white women voters and I have no idea how to start, how to do this for next election. But I have energy and passion and focus to put on this goal

@CarlCassCash1 @BetoORourke it's not all people, it was greater numbers of white people. most others voted for Beto. it's fear and racism. whites think Beto is going to herald a new era for darker skinned people and many whites are desperately trying to keep things maga, ie, suppressed
@realswordawg yes that was poorly worded, jumbled out sad tweet crossing over from different uphill election issues that progressives face!
@Rschooley that'll be the best burn
Beto is a really good guy and came within a whisper of unseating a tea party gop in a gerrymandered state. He met, face to face, countless Texans and they turned out for him. His sincerity and authenticity is the antithesis of cruz and he inspired millions. ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/UV8C2Q1Pks

@DogRescueDallas the context was in relation to the thread, that it's can be hard to imagine victory. I manifest things in my life all the time, and believe in the power of a lot of people visualizing and feeling victory
We've been beaten down so hard by the lies, corruption, indecency and injustice of this administration. It can be difficult to conjure up the immensity of victory. Time to stop hoping and wishing. Let's believe it.
Imagine the campaign staff who have worked tirelessly for months and years to support, raise money, help candidates. Imagine the candidate, how she or he feels overcoming huge odds. Imagine the joy and the celebrations.
Make fun of me all you want, but it doesn't hurt a thing. My life experience is one of clear visualizations and manifestations! Seriously!! DO IT!!
You've taken actions, right? voted, donated, more. Now, stop for a minute, several times for the next 3 days. Use the full power of your imagination, let yourself feel what righteous victory on election day would feel like. Picture the headlines, the news tickers, the tweets. 1/2

@Ryan0666 Exactly
I stayed off the internet &amp; news today to celebrate daughters 16th birthday. For one day, it felt normal to live in this country. Then I found out, no, it's not normal, it's an ever escalating worsening nightmare of lies, violence, rhetoric and gaslighting. #TreeOfLifeSynagogue

@BridgidOD Thanks! I love the way the demo sounds too, not taking anything away from how the band did it, there‚Äôs just a cool vibe thats different
@MassageHarmony I still have unused package I paid for, it would have been nice to get some notice so we could use them first. üò†
Make sure you have a No Regrets November!! I have shifts every day next week. Taking weekend off for daughters sweeeeet 16 üòç The outrage and disgust is so unhealthy. We've got to enjoy life, take care of ourselves, and work work work right up thru Nov 6th
I sure hope all the tweets I see exhorting their followers to VOTE are being made by people who are actively working to help Democrats win. Got some campaign or volunteer shifts on your schedule? It's not too late. SIGN UP #activism
@BridgidOD If you haven't heard it, you might like hearing the original demo! https://t.co/0rfSYF2Q4x
@tedcruz But it's fine, healthy, civil &amp; respectful to suggest putting @BetoORourke in a jail cell with Hillary Clinton? You aren't better than this, you ARE this. Stand up to Trump. Do the right thing if you want to represent Texas. If you can't, you don't deserve 6 more years.
@o_o_lbphoto_o_o As little as 2 years ago I never thought things would come to this. Now I'd be surprised by nothing. The worst horrors that have happened everywhere else can and probably will happen here. Millions chant about jailing opponents from 2 yrs ago. It's insanity.
it's Ireland when Protestants and Catholics were at war with each other. Our only hope is US voters/Dem party or GOP politicians realizing they've lost control of the Frankenstein and take their party back. https://t.co/O1YEzNOcFY

@JLawPA Not saying FDI isn't a good thing, of course that's how global economy works. Talking about Saudi and Russian blood money from autocratic regimes. Surely everyone can agree that $$ talks and any policy, value, moral or ethical concern can be bought and we should do better
@toknobbit exactly
@JLawPA Sorry to be unclear. My point is that the nationalism people espouse doesn‚Äôt extend to caring about how much foreign money and influence is corrupting the US. If you can‚Äôt tweet at me without insults then don‚Äôt bother.
So, I think I understand now: It's OK for major US assets to be bought by Saudi &amp; Russian riches. And basically, if immigrants coming illegally over border had the money to pour into their coffers, GOP would be fine w/no wall, no documents.
sick, brutal, brazen coverup by Trump, Pompeo, Kushner. no doubt. https://t.co/kIKJSpMWqN
@BILLKEYWEST They will NEVER do the right thing or take the righteous side if money is involved.
@RLanetteS @johnpavlovitz I have a little bit of the last one: feeling worried abt situations, events. Things like kids in cages, gutting earned programs, people dying w/out healthcare, women losing body autonomy, nuclear war, economy crashes, deficits, murder coverups for Saudi $ ~ to name just a few
@KennethWReid @johnpavlovitz I'm sorry. stay in the now. I suffer mainly when I imagine the future years, how I'd possibly handle 6 more years of this clown/nightmare show
@johnpavlovitz Yes. Struggling w anxiety and never have before. I‚Äôm going to go lose myself in making some music
@KariCares4U @BrookeBCNN I used the word ‚Äúmob‚Äù as a joke because Cruz used it in the debate, along with every other fear baiting tactic the GOP relies on to keep the base riled up and scared of their fellow Americans.
@survivecollapse I don't watch cable news or TV. I read reports from a variety of legitimate sources, both US &amp; worldwide perspective. I'm grateful each day for my blessings, yet still able to have compassion &amp;concern for those less fortunate who are going to suffer most under these policies.

STOP calling millions and millions of United States citizens an angry "mob." Your fearful and violence inciting rhetoric is DANGEROUS. @realDonaldTrump  @PressSec
@IamCoznoz @DaveOnTap @royalviking04 You and all MAGA people are the most hateful, bigoted, misogynistic individuals the rest of the country has experienced. your leader holds power for now. Minorities have been subjected to your mindset for ages, bless them. Look at who you follow to see unbridled hate
@IamCoznoz God kills babies every day, and your beliefs kill women. So, you're a hypocrite. Have a nice evening, I'm done here.
@IamCoznoz @DaveOnTap @royalviking04 How sad are you about the children who are unwanted, uneducated, uncared for, can't get medical help, can't get adopted, have addict or incarcerated parents? You best be spending lots of time, effort and money helping them if you care so much about babies being born.
@IamCoznoz Women will never have equality if they don't have the self determination to make major decisions abt their careers, homes, families and lives. No woman wants to have an abortion, believe me. But it must remain an option if men aren't going to share responsibility. and they don't.
@IamCoznoz @DaveOnTap @royalviking04 https://t.co/kRsLQTcXnt
Dude has picked the WRONG FUCKING time to tango about this. So sick of men like him and Bratt and Donnie and Mitch and Chuck and Orrin and Ted and John and ALL OF THEM  #RiseUp https://t.co/rGzNHTLPIO
@IamCoznoz and, if the young girl you got pregnant thought of abortion, and wanted one instead of making your irresponsibly deposited sperm wad into a baby, she should be able to. If things were the other way around, you'd all be crying for legal abortions.
@IamCoznoz Exactly. Government has no place telling a woman when she should have to put her body through excruciating pain. You have no argument for YOU taking responsibility to NOT get a woman pregnant. Get a freaking vasectomy, all of you. No more abortions. end of story.
No, you don't know how it works at all. A woman has as much right to sex as you do to stick your dick wherever you want. Government mandated condoms or vasectomies bring EXACT SAME results as what you say you want--no abortions. Why won't you argue for that? Too INCONVENIENT?? https://t.co/cuSHFPpTAt
@IamCoznoz @royalviking04 This is where we differ on what the difference is between a baby and a fertilized egg--which would never be fertilized without sperm, therefore a man has no right to order a woman to grow the zygote into a baby using her body.
@IamCoznoz @royalviking04 I suggest you read this thread and find one valid argument against it. https://t.co/NJhf9FiMhI
@IamCoznoz @royalviking04 Shouldn‚Äôt men like you get vasectomies if you are against the right of a woman to have an abortion? Your rich republican ladies will still be getting them, safely. The poor will suffer
@IamCoznoz @royalviking04 what are you most excited about? Stripping away LBGTQ rights, forcing women to carry babies to term, or removing all obstacles for corporations and the wealthiest to make more money at the expense of health, planet and least fortunate? Or is it the protection for Trump?
Senator Cornyn, I am a constituent, native Texan. Where's the evidence that anyone was paid to do this?

To vote NO &amp; confirm another conservative justice seems like a no brainer. But doing so would demoralize the base. The GOP is terrified of midterms &amp; losing control. This "win" will energize the base. Drunk w/power &amp; lib ownage, they will flock to polls. CRUCIAL FOR DEMS TO VOTE!

@staypufd It was A cotton gin, one, in ONE example he cited. Your point is pointless. The reporting is completely false and the actual quote and video proves it. Read the actual quote not what the Breitbart spin lie says. Beto said nothing racist. If you can't do that, stop tweeting at me.
@staypufd Bullshit. His point, very clearly stated in that right wing article even, is that illegal immigrants are doing jobs that no one else in the community will do and helping the economy. What do you find "disgusting" in this quote? https://t.co/JxIHX7DQl9
Say something nice about your opponent, Beto says he respects Cruz service and sacrifice. Cruz says. me me me then, he respects Beto's passion for socialism, like Bernie Sanders-. #TeamBeto responds: True to form. BOOM
"You tell me who can miss half their days at work and still be rehired for their job" #TeamBeto abt Cruz missing Senate votes. Cruz evokes Bogeyman Soros, Pelosi, HRC every chance he gets whether it's relevant to question or not.

@Snets99 @benchten I could be wrong, but from my understanding, Ford was unwilling to be named, which puts reveal at a disadvantage. you're right, Garland was treated terribly &amp; left a very bad taste so there's a case for "payback." But Kavanaughs past suggests some contempt for women
@Snets99 @benchten I think that's why she wanted an investigation, to ask witnesses as to whether he was there, determine if lies are being told. He has exhibited actions that make Dem women worry about equality and misogyny. I get that Rs nominate conservative judges.
@Snets99 @benchten Fords coming forth isn't the only strike, there is possible perjury &amp; the normal protocols of doc examination were shorted. Obviously the main Dem/GOP conflict re this confirmation is RoevWade concerns. Which is a topic unto itself
@Snets99 @benchten This isn't "payback"-his confirmation falls in an era where women now ask men to be accountable for acts or aggression &amp; intimidation, whenever they happened. It's abt character, responsibility. A SCOTUS judge should have both. Surely adult you recognizes &amp; regrets wrongful acts.

@JackieFox1976 Hey Jackie!! ‚ù§Ô∏è too long since we connected
Sometimes, if you get really quiet, you can hear the rustle of hush money checks being issued by terrified studio &amp; tv execs who used their position to coerce women for sexual favors or be sidelined into non-careers.  I've heard plenty of stories, wondering when their time is up
@_CarterRedd @MJW_resist @webradius @SenatorCollins I'm referring to the protocols of confirming a SCOTUS judge. They've gone out the window for this guy. No one is trying to get an indictment for her story. There's a statute and it's not provable.
@_CarterRedd @MJW_resist @webradius @SenatorCollins Why? There doesn't need to be an indictment. Just the normal protocols would suffice. If he stands up after going through what every other justice has gone through, so be it.
@_CarterRedd @MJW_resist @webradius @SenatorCollins He's not being charged with a penal offense-he's about to be appointed for life to the highest court in the land. After showing little regard for women in other instances, perjuring himself, no document oversight. It's enough to #DelayKavanaughVote
.@SenatorCollins Many women, D&amp;R, recall being teens in exact place as Christine Blasey Ford--getting cornered, felt up, dry humped &amp; worse. None of us should stand for her being labeled a liar. Many of us have teen daughters who go to parties. What message do we want to send?

@KevinPo41997393 @janewiedlin then their solution needs to involve men, and not punishing women. I believe the GOP agenda is to keep poor, minority women out of the work force, compromised and non-voting. I don't believe the evangelicals issue is human life either. It's about women being unequal to men. 2/2
@KevinPo41997393 @janewiedlin I don't think she is saying all men are "bad" or poorly behaved. The point is that women's rights to have a say as to whether she carries an unwanted pregnancy to term is under siege by the "pro-life" evangelicals &amp; GOP. If their agenda is truly stopping abortions 1/2

@lornadiane1 @Chicago_Reader @JAKEandRATSO this is a widely read free rag and you're right, I hate giving them any publicity or bringing attention to the stupid story. but it it so wrong. This is a perfect example of what Trump has brought our country to. Belittling and taunting.
This is @clem_burke. When he's not drumming w/@BlondieOfficial he drums w/other bands 'coz it makes him happy&amp;whole. He's on a short list of people I can count on for anything, anytime. The @Chicago_Reader published an article saying he had "Trump Face,"appearance shaming #WTF üò° https://t.co/ENKpX6Ya5H
Furious at @Chicago_Reader @JAKEandRATSO for mean spirited, public platform bullying a beloved musician who happens to be in his 60s &amp; GOD FORBID, aging. #ClemBurke doesn't look like fucking Trump you assholes &amp; even if he did it's still not ok to publish your spiteful "story"
@Chicago_Reader WTF is wrong with @Chicago_Reader &amp; @Jakeandratso publishing this? You targeted &amp; publically shamed a human being who looks nothing like Trump. Compared an innocent guy to a man universally accepted as hideous. Taunted him for his age and appearance. Lowest of the low bullies
@clem_burke Hey Jake Austen @JAKEandRATSO I hope you're happy trying to make a human being's appearance into a shits and giggles stupid piece of writing. How dare you? How would you like someone to go after your son this way?
@ShawnTexas1968 I don't think it comes off as liking him. It looks like veiled hostility and outrageously vindictive--for what I don't know. Maybe he got slighted when he was sucking up to Blondie one time
Meanwhile, people like Les Moonves raked in $70 mil A YEAR in salary. Here's something I do for fun sometimes. Go on @YahooFinance, pick any company. Any. Obscure small one is great. Click on symbol.

@JAKEandRATSO wtf was that piece comparing Clem's appearance to Trump about? What did he do to you? Do you think Johnny Marr looks like Trump too? Paul McCartney? What is wrong with you attacking someone's appearance publicly? Asshole.
@clem_burke what an absurd comparison. Trump has a butthole mouth, frog eyes, a scalp tuck w/bleached combover &amp; oozes evil narcissism from every pore. Clem on the other hand has a nice mouth, kind eyes, gorgeous hair and good natured enjoyment of his talents. That writer is a stupid fuck.

@FredReitman @officialgogos @MrleeTx @BetoORourke wrong. Beto will not "do as he's told." Ted Cruz will continue his legacy of lining pockets and ensuring that the rich get richer and the poors stay that way
@officialgogos jeez 90mph!
@realDonaldTrump EVERY insult and complaint you claim against others is a blatant projection of the transparent truth about yourself. YOU are Crooked Donald, YOU are Cryin,' Lyin Donald, YOU are FAKE. The truth means nothing to you. And the enemy of all people, your followers included, is YOU

@rowdyh1 @TexasGOP I think less war would be the most effective way to keep our military undead and unwounded.
@rowdyh1 @TexasGOP Your dogs are adorable! Those candidates were elected to public office and abused their power and tricked people. Beto has come clean and answers every question put to him, unafraid to meet and talk to all Texans, whatever party. And he cares far more about veterans than the GOP
ran out of characters to include WAR CRIMINAL https://t.co/u7dT1I1zbe
Hey @TexasGOP trying to discredit #Beto -Really wanna go there? Ok, our turn: Ken Paxton/securities fraud, Tom DeLay/money laundering, Steve Stockman/fraud-28 charges, Blake Farenthold/lewd, abusive, owes us 84k, Joe Barton/YIKES,LOL, Rick Perry/abuse of power, George Bush/DUI

@MichaelYarnell2 @DonnaHulsey4 @johnlegend John Edwards, Bill Clinton shattered me w/ their poor behavior, judgment. Keeping a world view that's all abt "them" &amp; "us," unable to see nuance, shades, individuals w/out generalized stereotypes or lumped characterizations keeps people divided and unfocused on real issues.
gag. https://t.co/x3fDaaoBF9
@TheDebr1 @rockhall @officialgogos @officialschock @belindaofficial @Charlottegogos @janewiedlin thanks for saying it right! Often reporters say that we say we were the first all fem band to play instruments &amp; write our own songs. No. We don't claim that and know that's not true. The crucial part we ALWAYS say is: ...."to have a number one album."
Can‚Äôt believe this isn‚Äôt a bigger story. Outrageous. Trump warns evangelicals of 'violence' if GOP loses in the midterms - https://t.co/H9t1XjkjGt
@toby_dorena @BetoORourke @POTUS also, I appreciate your tone, you discuss your convictions without name calling and trolling. I hope we all can be represented because we are not all the same. Cheers Toby take care
@toby_dorena @BetoORourke @POTUS Both parties have had corruption, not kept up w/Infrastructure, tech, long game for future. corporate greed &amp; unchecked capitalism hurts everyone-left&amp;right. GOP distracts w/fear &amp; fake bogeymen. Neither side is going away, so we either learn to live together or?
@toby_dorena @BetoORourke @POTUS Texas is my state too, born&amp;raised. I don't share your opinions but good leaders can bring us all together. We all want to thrive, have our savings intact, our healthcare, education and jobs for our kids, clean water.
@TexasTribune #unroll @threadreaderapp
@DonnaHulsey4 @johnlegend Misdemeanor infractions are past mistakes that he openly discusses, regrets &amp; is grateful for 2nd chance to serve constituents. No burglary-went over fence w/some pals. The DWI, driving a drunken friend&amp;admits poor judgment. Beto is honorable, hear him speak before you judge.
If people would  show up, just show up to hear him, he‚Äôd win. The message of hope and positivity and decency and fairness is SO powerful. @BetoORourke https://t.co/mP2necRVgN

I don't use the "F*** N**** phrase that Trump invented to destroy democracy. The way @CBSNews handled the false and inflammatory headline that did @BetoORourke a huge injustice made the situ WORSE. Their social media person, oversight person or editorial process needs replacing https://t.co/pWjPA6qHiJ
@CBSNews OMG. With your "correction" you've now managed to restate the offensive and false headline 2 more times. Wtf is going on there??
@peterack @CBSNews I don‚Äôt use that phrase, I believe it‚Äôs a harmful trope invented to perpetuate FUD and destroy democracy. @cbsnews either knowingly or stupidly wrote a bad headline
@CBSNews MASSIVE FAIL @CBSNews -congrats on making a false, reductive soundbite out of arguably the most eloquent statement that has been made about the peaceful protest of racism and injustice by these athletes.

@BILLKEYWEST let me know your reaction. xxlove u Bill
@BridgidOD @bstettin He spit on Ness, was disrupting show, harassing all 3 bands on the bill. A NeoNazi looking to cause trouble. Artists are supposed to keep their mouths shut and perform? Punk rock ones at that? Never heard that rule.
@TonyRenner @jessedayton @BootsRiley @Sorry2BotherYou It's an excellent story &amp; hugely important film, urge you not to miss it! The intensity is something we should experience. Until WP fully accept, acknowledge &amp; act upon POC lives &amp; reality, society will continue to devolve.
Best picture #Blackkklansman #Masterpiece GO. Everyone go. This IS America.
@MaroonedInMarin He's from El Paso not Ireland. it's a nickname-some people actually grew up w/Latino pals. But if the name a good candidate goes by is the most important issue in your life, you have a privilege few can claim. Hope you troll Rafael Cruz supporters just as hard.
@MaroonedInMarin @peterframpton I support a candidate using whatever fucking name he wants as long as he cares about veterans, jobs, healthcare and education, and shows up, unafraid to meet constituents or take questions and criticisms.

@Jimmy93756504 as I said, I wish I hadn't commented but I'd been up late writing, tired, and love me some Social D so just put it out there w/out thinking about the political action I was endorsing. I agree 100% w you and thank you for respectful engagement here.
@Jimmy93756504 tbh, I wish I'd never commented, but I'll stand by what I said &amp; just finish w/this: you're right! but there's also more to this than this guys story. He was a massive threatening neoNazi looking for a fight, spitting on a performer. He knew Ness wasn't gonna take that.
@alolmost @laurenduca @WeDemandJustice @wendydavis No Roe=telling a woman she must carry a pregnancy to term IS controlling her body. No access=unsafe procedures, deaths. Keeping the poor w/out options. Privileged will still get them easily.
@alolmost @laurenduca @WeDemandJustice @wendydavis Advocate for education, healthcare, etc for already born&amp;hopeless. There are actual babies and children that need your passion &amp; commitment! The adult responsibility you demand is not shared by men, therefore unequal, oppressive to women.
@bstettin @jessedayton I agree. I'm a lover not a fighter. But didn't you like it just a tiny bit, for instance, when NeoNazi Richard Spencer got clocked on film that time? üòáüëäüèº
@bstettin @jessedayton @mikeness @SocialD1 @JonnyTwoBags that's what I'd do. but... a)performers are vulnerable, exposed onstage. fans don't realize what that's like. b)touring's exhausting-show is the fun part and he was ruining that c)tough guys who fuck w/other tough guys might get punched and they know it when they do it
@RWitherspoon @HOHmusical This Go-Go (and my daughter) LOVE you @Rwitherspoon, have shared many wonderful hours enjoying your films. Hope you love @HOHmusical and thank you for getting the word out!
@alolmost @laurenduca @WeDemandJustice @wendydavis No, protecting rights for women to self determine their own bodies and destiny. Mandated condoms and voluntary vasectomies would help unwanted pregnancies, maybe you could make that your cause?
@Jimmy93756504 Assault is never ok, but when a huge tough guy is antagonizing, provoking and disrupting a performance, some artists might take issue with it. That the big toughie boohoos to the press to wallow in his 15 min of attention&amp;fame is telling.
I‚Äôm at #RiseUpForRoe with @laurenduca @wedemandjustice @wendydavis et al https://t.co/7f6OlptoGg
@AllisonSommer1 He's onstage trying to put on a great show for the fans and one huge tough guy is antagonizing and ruining it, so my guess is he felt provoked and threatened. Being onstage performing puts artist in a vulnerable place. But, overreact, yea maybe
@PDHSki @mikeness @SocialD1 @JonnyTwoBags no but have had people who clearly aren't enjoying themselves who seem to want to stay and let you know that
How lucky we are to have the gift of ArethA https://t.co/v3Xv0yTkNX

@Amy_Siskind Legitimizing Sarah Palin, putting her on a national stage did nothing positive for women or the US. Just a gateway drug to Trump with her moronic bs. More importantly, WOC are the greatest allies we can have. WW going to do what they do. WOC got the fire
@lizzwinstead @Amy_Siskind @AngryBlackLady it begs the question--would she (Amy S) be supporting Trump if he was a woman? Her hero Palin paved the way for him.

@SandraHelena39 @NekoCase I'm not refusing to grasp anything, I remain open and willing to learn and educate myself and do the best I can to gather info. Maybe I'm not in the know as much as you are, but it's certainly not from "refusing to grasp."
@popscribe @NekoCase I think you're right: same mistakes will be made by the same "we." So the "we" needs to be different. BUT. GOP think tanks worked for decades ensuring Dem "we" got gerrymandered, jailed, marginalized, repressed. it's corrupt. &amp; so FUCKEDUP
@NekoCase All this popular vote vs EC, non-voters, 3rd party voters stuff is practically irrelevant compared to the fact that a diabolical, frightening and far-reaching picture has emerged: The GOP must, will, &amp; did destroy Democracy, norms, institutions to win and stay won.

Reductive thinking. Women's march isn't a 1 issue cause. We march 4 solidarity: against policies, injustice, misogyny, oppression, bigotry, racism. We march for freedom &amp; equality. To support BLM, DACA, CHIP. For health care, environment, education, the poor. https://t.co/t1tAu4myrE
@dhruval_1 Women are strong and able to work hard, support and care for families, make progress in life, have full careers, be productive and creative. And still make time to exercise their right to protest laws and policies they disagree with. Your trolling is a waste of time.

@royalviking04 because he‚Äôs a good guy and did what was best for him and family and party w/lynch mob after him. Ethics investigation would have been enough.This is a side show. The country is being raped, robbed &amp; assaulted while an imperfect but great politician goes down
@royalviking04 1 said he grabbed her waist &amp; squeezed in the photo. not harassment. 2 said he "tried" to kiss them-of those, 1 said he was walking towards her like he was "going to kiss her."

@bjdzyak @ReaganWorld wearing a low cut dress isn't exposing breasts. do you get harassed if you wear jeans that accentuate your junk? Didn't think so.üòÇ
@bjdzyak @ReaganWorld I'm not blaming men for being attracted to women-that's absurd. He states that women should expect harassment if they wear a low cut dress.
@bjdzyak @ReaganWorld point wasn't to equivocate. it was taking, to an extreme, the notion that a given person is responsible for another person's conduct
@angrykittenpaws @ReaganWorld I'm sorry, I didn't think about that. Reactive to his idiocy.

@marlareagan63 no one cares Hillary lost. and you just proved yourself incapable of reading comprehension
@marlareagan63  I tried to engage with you &amp; you twist my words to make me look bad when my intentions were clear. done. enjoy your day.
@marlareagan63 i said i DONT judge millions based on the actions of few.
@marlareagan63 you misread. i did not say that at all. i said the opposite
@marlareagan63 the president let Putin and Russia infiltrate our security and you're worried about Madonna?!
@marlareagan63 i did not see those images because i get my news from reputable journalism. any crowd of 100k is going to have some nuts
@marlareagan63 I don't judge millions of conservatives based on the actions of extreme right wingers who hate blacks and worship hitler
@marlareagan63 this is from a right leaning paper: https://t.co/MEfuHkwr75
@marlareagan63 the women's march was the largest in entire US history &amp; also took place around the world. not 1 arrest or act of violence.
@marlareagan63 if you look at this thread, you'll see where hate's coming from. I try everyday to have a connection w/someone on your side.
@bapruger77 i hope everyone tires of that. there are millions of libs&amp;cons, neither are going anywhere. I want a govt that can work for both
@bapruger77 also, appreciate not being name-called, thank you for responding like humans are supposed to
@bapruger77 I didn't hear any address that started that way, but I had issues w/that presidency2. Agree with you leadership, system broken
@bapruger77 I'd be happy with a good, old fashioned Conservative--many in my family share your beliefs but can't tolerate this fool

@cali4tune @EddieWyatt1963 #TillersonExxonInvadeUkraineContolCrimeaPeninsulaTaxFreeOil Connect the dots, you have your guys narrative.
@realDonaldTrump their job is to fight espionage, they have no choice when Congress refuses to act

@prophetbecky you need help, blasphemy to call yourself a prophet. wow.
@cali4tune @realDonaldTrump someone sounds like a parrot
@dnricketts what do you mean? buyers remorse for what? I despise Trump
@PaulDavidBuckn3 have a good day Paul! take care of yourself, you made my day too!
@PaulDavidBuckn3 what we just did is what people need to do.We still disagree, but we tried to listen &amp; understand. much respect for you sir
@PaulDavidBuckn3 you too, Americans have amazing freedoms and rights, let's keep it that way. Thank you for your service!
@PaulDavidBuckn3 how is it that not one of you can see that you elected a dangerous moron? seriously.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 the largest in history. in cities all over the country and the world. it was amazing.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 wtf are you talking about? my real name is plan to see, at the beginning of your tweet. Stop with the name calling, jeez.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 the biggest protest in American history on January 21 had zero violence. Read a newspaper.
@Gitte35 @realDonaldTrump your POTUS is the whiner, you wake up fool
@FallingDog @jpvogt probably going to get audited this year! lol
@PaulDavidBuckn3 you're the one insulting people dude. you think Trump cares about you? that's the definition of delusional, right there
@PaulDavidBuckn3 all I hear from you is close mindedness, an inability to discuss actual facts instead of sweeping general opinions
@PaulDavidBuckn3 Redistricting to deny voting rights to POC is a GOP game. Not ratifying the ERA: GOP game. Climate change denying: GOP game
@PaulDavidBuckn3 I could copy and paste that, replacing liberal with conservative and have just as valid a case as you present.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 definitions of liberal in dictionary. it's not a term that insults me in the least.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 accord w/concepts of max individual freedom possible as guaranteed by law &amp; secured by govt protection of civil liberties.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 liberal: favoring or permitting freedom of action, especially with respect to matters of personal belief or expression:
@PaulDavidBuckn3 liberal: free from prejudice or bigotry. relating to representational forms of govt rather than aristocracies &amp; monarchies
@PaulDavidBuckn3 what I notice is corruption, greed&amp;tax evasion from rich fear&amp;blame from mid-class &amp; dehumanizing the poor-who's winning?
@PaulDavidBuckn3 totally agree. cheers, and have a good evening
@PaulDavidBuckn3 there's millions of people w/different ideas&amp;ways living in 1 country. important to find common ground, I try, you too, k?
@cynh9342 @PaulDavidBuckn3 I didn't like a lot of what Obama did. But delegitimizing our societal institutions is wrong &amp; dangerous.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 @williamlegate @BrendaB56 I just ask: instead of hating "libtards" focus on your candidate's tweets &amp; responses to US probs
@PaulDavidBuckn3 @williamlegate @BrendaB56 I am pissed at Dems, but that's over. What we're up against now is the rise of an autocrat.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 @williamlegate @BrendaB56 Liberals would have rallied to his cause if he'd act presidential, be a leader. Drain the swamp.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 @williamlegate @BrendaB56 you people think it's the winning that bothers us- but it's the lies, stupidity &amp; puppet-actions
@jpvogt hmmm. it looks like it's "attached" to me--I see my response with the others
@jpvogt not sure what you mean!
@realDonaldTrump we don't care. you think your bullshit Mark Cuban, Nordstrom, crowd size tweets will distract us? get a fucking clue

@USABigTee so my initial tweet was more about refugee ban which is another issue, but I do think illegals do a lot of work we need done
@USABigTee is broken too. but they worked hard, paid taxes, saved $,hired lawyers &amp; became citizens. fine, honorable people w/strong family
@USABigTee i've known a few undoc immigrants who came illegally to escape horrible place, to make a better life. the system to help those
@USABigTee appreciate hearing your experience how it forms your opinions. I try to listen&amp;understand other views&amp;dont believe all i read
@USABigTee "you are obviously an idiot"-not a good way to have dialog. I have many GOPfriends I can discuss issues w &amp; not be insulted : )
@USABigTee which federal law? I hope name calling makes you feel like a big man, it certainly has no affect on me or my IQ
@USABigTee @Govtchecker @GregAbbott_TX I do not "tweet blindly"--but if I wanted to, that is legal too. POTUS does it non-stop!! lol! cheers
@USABigTee @Govtchecker @GregAbbott_TX I did read the law. state and local governments are NOT required to help the feds enforce federal law
@Govtchecker @GregAbbott_TX Let's enforce laws that are constitutional &amp; pro-American values. Officers don't need to be Trump EO henchmen.
