@robdelaney i pick number 1 and number 5 for technique.
@ParkerMolloy @pramitheus wo! now all i can see are the cuts! damn
Omg he changed his hair color!  https://t.co/Rq0lyJdK0u
@John_Royal thanks John. reading
@TimothyHorrigan I thought the amount of white men looked a little off on that stage for that particular film. reading the @esquire piece now
now I have to go read about the controversy surrounding the best picture.  good job julia roberts wrapping up an awkward end
another great speech! alfonso cuaron. I rarely watch the #oscars but I'm so glad I did tonight. Loved so many of the films, want to see the ones I missed.
Olivia Colman RULES. How adorable was that acceptance? Amazing performance in The Favourite
never liked that Shallow song much but that performance won me over to it. @ladygaga killed
i love this #Oscars2019 because of how much the GOPS would hate it 😜 #representation
@megsamthx no, the usually perfect Jennifer Hudson
@natasharothwell horrible song and she's gorgeous but yikes yeah. loudly pitchy
@JeffReddKross I didn’t know that! We need to have an Egypt convo! Best adventure
@MollyJongFast such a nasty disposition. I wonder if she'd even recognize joy.
@VincentConnare No I went by myself to Egypt. Huge adventure
@TheDebr1 @mikelrouse @MotuDP Yes indeedy!
@IAmTheRealNickP @NeumannBerlin @rodemics MUSIC SOUNDTRACK
@Nox_Amicus @mikelrouse @MotuDP DP has tons of sounds and surprised at how good the Apple stuff is on this new computer. I ran PT on Mavericks system for several years, wasn't supposed to work and finally didn't. Couldn't open one track. Ran to Apple store and started over.
wall hanging is from trip to Egypt, a tent canvas like a lot of the stalls use. I wanted to bring one home desperately! looked at tons, most had gorgeous Islamic designs, but this one had traditional Egyptian motifs. Weighs a ton, lugged it around the desert for 2 wks. worth it.
@Nox_Amicus @mikelrouse @MotuDP I have built in tech support and expertise w/Mikel and we will be collaborating a lot. But also Logic looked like glorified GarageBand to me, and I always feel very confused with that program. I'm liking DP a lot, but miss being more adept as I was with PT
For those interested, very simple but effective set up: iMac- still waiting to add more RAM, DP working well w/stock Mac. API mic pre, UA 1176, @neumannberlin vintage U67, a few ‘57s and @Rodemics NT1. Need to add my prior Waves bundle from PT, right now enjoying the DP plug ins
Finally got my new home studio set up thanks @mikelrouse for converting me to @motuDP which I’m now learning since #ProTools isn’t compatible w my new Mac&amp;OS. Ready to make a soundtrack! https://t.co/u5uwWs4mPq
@NekoCase i use MS Word for Mac, broke down and got the license after using for years and I'm happy with it.
@anbhc @janewiedlin 🔥🔥🔥
Now I’ll daydream about this too! ❤️ https://t.co/bPtS1zWJdr
@TishLiza @kamalaforPOTUS I check all candidates out thoroughly! no slacker here. It's going to be a wild ride, but hopefully respectful and not eating ourselves
I liked hearing from everyone. Of course it’s too early to decide but it’s not too early for us to be excited and having discussions. My sense overall is that we are feeling good about the options so far ❤️ thx for playing
@MarlenePassaro @amyklobuchar Me too..hi Marlene!! Too long!
@clairec345 I liked her since the Kavanaugh hearings. To be honest I’d never heard of her before that
@Chris_Huff His declaration was great. Like her SO much
@den_down_unda I really really like her and think she’d make a great president. But Trump has poisoned her candidacy from his bully pulpit. I can’t stand it but I think he has managed to fuck things up for her
@ThatTonyH Yeah I just thought I’d have an inclination by now!
@linle23 I really liked Bernie’s candidacy declaration, but man I’m feeling the same way as you
I don’t know who to support yet. What are your thoughts? Not at ALL into hive mind🤡 I follow some cool people and curious what are your thoughts? #2020 Ps I’m a Dem lefty in case that wasn’t blaringly clear by now
@SarahThyre all y'all youngsters! for me: "Rebel, Rebel" when Diamond Dogs came out~ was the goals and the bio and the everything ⚡️❤️

@talking80s yes!!!
@DannyDeraney it's true! this little win made my day! I think it's also celebrating and enjoying the result of determination and patience.
I tried daily for 10 days to get a new water filter into my refrigerator. Had almost lost hope. This morning I got it in by pressing and turning the exact way at the same time 🤓 SUCCESS IS THE SWEETEST, even in little things, tech stuff etc. Know what I mean? #SHaringMyTriumph
@privatear2001 thank you !! have a lovely day 🙂
Happy celebration of *LOVE* today! Me and my LDR BF having a #ValentinesDay date tonight, watching Roma together with Facetime, popcorn, glass of wine (him) and herbal tea (me) and I can't wait! #makinItWork

@darth soulful Tux https://t.co/BObeX8ZxVH
@adamcbest omg this is frighteningly true
@joecoscarelli @melenar 2nd - when I was young, I had the support of many male musicians I looked up to. It was incredibly validating. I can't even imagine the VERY different course my career would have taken had these guys used my interest &amp; passion for music as an access point to hustle me for sex
@joecoscarelli 1st, thank u Joe and @melenar for this story. I hope the women you spoke to can withstand the gaslighting and assholes who are surely going to rain upon them. Everyone who is so inclined, please send mega support to counteract the fallout.
@amyohconnor His "leagal eagle" also represents Brian Singer 🤮

@Serendeppity @brandicarlile @Talkhouse insane https://t.co/vlMscglYQx
@leasdef @brandicarlile lol! in my first line of that review I said she made me think for a bit that my entire output was worthless!
SO happy for @brandicarlile --nearly 5 yrs ago I reviewed her 6th record for @Talkhouse and can't believe it took this long for the "industry" to recognize and award her https://t.co/kIpsPcUw4i
Yesterday at @UMG Grammy showcase party. Saw some great performances by emerging and current artists and old friends who have moved up to some very high places. And I played “count the lame Gucci attire and accessories” which was the best part https://t.co/DS1Mo6cYgX

@Kspencer17 that is the nicest compliment and I thank you for saying it, made my day!
People who are desperately wanting to stop or have a nagging feeling that they have a problem may see someone announce their sober anniversary and suddenly have clarity. I’ve had dozens of people tell me they were inspired to get sober after reading a post from me. Not bragging. https://t.co/r9UeFduSWB
@realDonaldTrump Ask your buddy for a tour of his death camps. The ones that are well documented, where  they send dissenters and contrarians. #TrumpBoner

"The foundation of our moral leadership around the globe is free and fair elections, where voters pick their leaders – not where politicians pick their voters." ~ @staceyabrams
ok, i caved and took a look. WHY does he keep doing that weird twisting his shoulder and head tilt thing over and over and over again? BIZARRE. ok bye #StateOfTheUnion
Don’t wanna jinx it. But thanks pals! xo
@leasdef your turn! do it
@debbiecruzbeal @therealosio @factsmatter2020 @AOC I was talking about his abortion mansplain complaining. I didn't mean vasectomies to stop sexual abuse.
@therealosio @debbiecruzbeal @factsmatter2020 @AOC Vasectomies. there's your solution. Men get vasectomies and presto, issue under control. Reverse it when you want to become a dad.
@aaronleetasjan1 @Fly_Norwegian what?! after the crummy check in and refusing carry on instruments they lost the shit???
@TheDebr1 I can only imagine how bad you freaked out!

@SarahThyre gross. don't try that in texas, death penalty big here
@Horustoo 😖
@Fly_Norwegian @aaronleetasjan1 I hope @aaronleetasjan1 issue is addressed with more than lip service. His issue is one all musicians share. Your airline could really help us get overseas and reach audiences, increasing chances for livelihood. Be our friend not our foe
@CheetahdaveDave I hope you prevail and are well represented. Sorry for your troubles.
@clairec345 Dittooo
@kentchicago Sweet!! 😘
@svm_sarah @KennethWReid You're not alone there. I have so many friends who ended up with those kind of legal fees. I sure hope you have recovered emotionally and financially. xoxo
@Donnalou327 When I brush aside my instincts and then look back after something goes wrong it makes me SO mad that I didn't honor them. I'm sorry you got snookered by a shady landlord, ugh.
@Andysoupdragon good choice!!
@devilsrancher doubtful but I'll ask her
@SeanRobbins13 I hope it's a regret you've come to terms with and that you got some wonderful experiences you wouldn't have otherwise ❤️
@TennisSteve88 bless you Steve, what a perfect description of a place so many find themselves. It's a long process and being mindful of the awareness if you're lucky enough to get some.

@BatMorda Oh that's horrible. I 'm so sorry
@MattTheE yes!! lol
mine is going to cost me 14k. I'm sobbing and semi-nauseous
I need to feel better about a stupid mistake. Tell me your most expensive, costly mistake and how you let yourself off the hook. no judgment here, mine's a doozy

@realDonaldTrump We get it. It's better to have people talking about what an utter moron you are than not talking about you at all. But to purposefully lead your base followers away from science, facts, and evidence is despicable. Be a fucking hero for once in your life and take the right stand.

@talking80s Cool. To be clear, I wasn’t born then— and was a teen in the 70s. Regarding my Little Richard post.

@Libs_Disease someone with the twitter handle Libs Disease Trump is Saving America thinks I might have an inability to separate politics from circumstance. lol
I'm not a fan nor do I hate Michael Avenatti. Took him w/a grain of salt and hoped he might help bring Trump down-- the schtick didn't warrant my attention despite the media wanting it to. But something about his arrest seems false and fishy https://t.co/tPQ8nuf0lW

@twittmanda Thank you! I think my lack of water has made it spike lately
@MrPaulLaD I don't have earwax, per doctor exam
this this this! good stuff. read the story, read the story!! thank you @Davis_Hammet https://t.co/ba1mDCu4XY
@ElizabethofR many people develop tinnitus after taking meds. I didn't know this until I got it
@ElizabethofR crowdsource asking is my last resort usually. I talked to 3 doctors and researched for months and came here to supplement what I've found
@ElizabethofR I did.
@ElizabethofR maybe it was both then. I had a bone graft oral surgery, I took the pain med a little, and the antibiotic, but it gave me heartburn and I stopped. The pain lasted 2 wks and I have a very high pain threshold. The tinnitus started somewhere in there.
@rodstewart absolutely right @rodstewart ❤️
@dreamwithfaith just making sure!! lol
@BruceBrager no I haven't made his acquaintance! good trivia though
@Mazdafun2 @TheWho thanks!
@dreamwithfaith that's actually great to hear. mine feels louder lately and I think I've been slacking on the water. thanks. wait, you mean the more water depleted you are, it's worse right?
@mikecher How much do you take? I have some in a multi but it’s prob not enough
@schigodi Yes I’ve been told our brains adapt to it. I’m much better than I was, and pretty much accept it but look (calmly) for solutions. Nice to hear from others who have it
@JohnKelly I LOVE THE SHOW!! so happy you are seeing it. So much joy.
@DavidRiley62 really! ok, I will make it a practice. thank you
@automatics1im @mollie1961 I haven't heard of pink/brown noise, I'll check that out. I use a combo of my Oasis Air filter on high and a water sound app.
@csonsini thank you for this link!
@DavidRiley62 I'll get some zinc and GB. Did that you tube thing, it helps for about 5 seconds!
@pegkeady always had perfect hearing, this happened right after antibiotics, ones I'd never had before. Tinnitus is linked to many different causes. And, yes youre right, Ive reduced sugar and caffiene drastically. Still there.
@Moonspinner55 yes I did that. I didn't have any wax build up though
@RobLowe It's so tragic. I can't imagine from your perspective
@jenbourgoyne But the sound is inside my body, not outside. I don't understand how headphones could help tinnitus?
@ChazReddBear @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump We got a free pass. Can you imagine what Trumps deranged speech would have been like??
@Sauvignon64 like a few drops in each ear? regular HP or special kind?
@SeanRobbins13 yes daytimes I keep busy and stay distracted. I used to drive in silence, now I need music. And night times are a drag. I stay up until I'm exhausted so I can fall asleep. My sympathies to you
@Bjornapoor I used to do TM now I can't meditate. But I do some neck exercises etc.
@realcbj @TheRyanAdams it's not a cut and dried symptom of any one thing. Linked to that, also: viral, stress, toxic metals, actual damage (I've played loud music since age of 16) thank you for reply!
@MickPuck I think absolutely this might help. thanks for the reminder. I'm probably yin depleted
best thing I've read all year. Thank you for spelling out such a legit sounding scenario and damn, I hope this guy is spot on. https://t.co/bDvEfGaxxl
@BeltwayGreg I tried stopping and I still had it, so now I have just one cup a day. Maybe I'll try quitting again. thank you
@David96601481 does it have a name?
Twitter friends: Asking. After a round of antibiotics a few months ago I ended up w/tinnitus. Sounds like a swarm of cicadas in my head 24/7. Done due diligence Google research, talked to docs. Won't do pharma/surgery. Anyone know of nature help w/this condition?
@trappist_e probably both. ignorance cuts a wide swath

@cmclymer where is that amazing thread you wrote some time ago about  enlisting and being trained to learn how to kill?? I'd like to see that again and think it's relevant to the Borderline massacre.
@jpierce0101 @BettyBuckley @Acosta He didn't do anything to her. His arm was up as he turned from her repeated grasps and came down as he made his point talking, then he said "Pardon me, Ma'am" when it made contact with hers. Zero aggression on his part. If she'd been harmed, Trump would've squawked on the spot.
@KeatonPatti these bot scripts are the best thing in the entire twitter. I don't know how to make a bot do anything, but keep doing it, please.
@dreamwithfaith sorry
So filled with sadness and horror at the senseless loss of lives last night in Thousand Oaks after another gunman rampage. We are not safe, our kids are not safe. The atrocities are commonplace and random.
@nordique1972 @thebeaches I wish but too much holiday stuff going on that week

@MrPaulLaD D senate
@MrPaulLaD Yes I know but it affects why our congressional districts stay R and that keeps state R and harder to get R senate. Just poorly worded
@swierczy ❤️
@johnnygoudie @mjhegar do it MJ, you won't regret!!! Johnny is the best
@StanleyJames05 @PressSec @Acosta he said Excuse me, Ma'am. wtf is wrong with that? And he didn't push her arm, she kept trying to pull a mic away when he was DOING HIS JOB, putting her arm in his way. This was a set up. Surprised they didn't tell her to flop on the floor and scream in agony
@PDHSki I'd heard abt these gals, my friend knows them but been too buried in my bookwritin' to dive in. thanks for the reminder!
@thebeaches I LOVE YOUR BAND! 🤘🏾😍🎸🥁⚡️🎶 just listened and watched everything I could find and can't wait to see you gals somewhere on the road. xoxoxkv
@JLawPA He has a right to ask questions at a press conference. He said "excuse me, ma'am" as she tried to stop him from doing his job. I'm done engaging with you, bye

@laurenduca his cult would come after us with NRA supplied weaponry
I looked at some gop influencer twitter feeds (I know, gag 🤮--not just seeing their feeds, but that these jerks are influencers AND the fact I use the word "influencer" 🤮🤮) ANYWAY.  They are saying he KARATE CHOPPED her arm. As she tries to wrest mic away from him.
@mactavish I looked on gop influencer twitter. they show a close up of his arm moving down on her arm while she's trying to wrest the mic away. And they are calling it a karate chop
*all I can do
the @PressSec is a disgusting excuse of a human being. Accusing Jim @Acosta when it is plain to the world what happened. And the MAGAts see what she says, despite video proof. I'm fucking outraged again and I can do is tweet about it. https://t.co/WebWGvCk9o
@rosannecash @camanpour great interview! ❤️
@mjhegar So proud of you and can't wait to support you whatever you do
@nowhitenonsense @deray it's abortion. that's why Christian white women vote R. The other abhorrent policies could sway them, but very difficult to change someone's mind about "baby killing" narrative
@JRaney213 @rgay It's abortion. @lizzwinstead has been saying this for years. It's the single issue, not a wedge issue. This is why white women vote R.
we need to think a long game. it's what the gops have done since Reagan. We see the problems in this country, the underlying cause, the racism, fear, lack of education. Abortion is a HUGE issue, what drives many white women to vote R. Big probs to address before change comes
@rgay Same in TXSen race. I thought change would come by working to GOTV for new voters. Now I see it's about changing the mindset of these white women voters and I have no idea how to start, how to do this for next election. But I have energy and passion and focus to put on this goal
@_NaomiMoreno @RealChrisJaxon @adamcbest right here, via @FireinFreetown https://t.co/puSc8DL7Gc
@CarlCassCash1 @BetoORourke it's not all people, it was greater numbers of white people. most others voted for Beto. it's fear and racism. whites think Beto is going to herald a new era for darker skinned people and many whites are desperately trying to keep things maga, ie, suppressed
@realswordawg yes that was poorly worded, jumbled out sad tweet crossing over from different uphill election issues that progressives face!
@Rschooley that'll be the best burn
Beto is a really good guy and came within a whisper of unseating a tea party gop in a gerrymandered state. He met, face to face, countless Texans and they turned out for him. His sincerity and authenticity is the antithesis of cruz and he inspired millions. ❤️ https://t.co/UV8C2Q1Pks

@DogRescueDallas the context was in relation to the thread, that it's can be hard to imagine victory. I manifest things in my life all the time, and believe in the power of a lot of people visualizing and feeling victory
We've been beaten down so hard by the lies, corruption, indecency and injustice of this administration. It can be difficult to conjure up the immensity of victory. Time to stop hoping and wishing. Let's believe it.
Imagine the campaign staff who have worked tirelessly for months and years to support, raise money, help candidates. Imagine the candidate, how she or he feels overcoming huge odds. Imagine the joy and the celebrations.
Make fun of me all you want, but it doesn't hurt a thing. My life experience is one of clear visualizations and manifestations! Seriously!! DO IT!!
You've taken actions, right? voted, donated, more. Now, stop for a minute, several times for the next 3 days. Use the full power of your imagination, let yourself feel what righteous victory on election day would feel like. Picture the headlines, the news tickers, the tweets. 1/2

@MassageHarmony I still have unused package I paid for, it would have been nice to get some notice so we could use them first. 😠
Make sure you have a No Regrets November!! I have shifts every day next week. Taking weekend off for daughters sweeeeet 16 😍 The outrage and disgust is so unhealthy. We've got to enjoy life, take care of ourselves, and work work work right up thru Nov 6th
I sure hope all the tweets I see exhorting their followers to VOTE are being made by people who are actively working to help Democrats win. Got some campaign or volunteer shifts on your schedule? It's not too late. SIGN UP #activism
@BridgidOD If you haven't heard it, you might like hearing the original demo! https://t.co/0rfSYF2Q4x
@tedcruz But it's fine, healthy, civil &amp; respectful to suggest putting @BetoORourke in a jail cell with Hillary Clinton? You aren't better than this, you ARE this. Stand up to Trump. Do the right thing if you want to represent Texas. If you can't, you don't deserve 6 more years.
@o_o_lbphoto_o_o As little as 2 years ago I never thought things would come to this. Now I'd be surprised by nothing. The worst horrors that have happened everywhere else can and probably will happen here. Millions chant about jailing opponents from 2 yrs ago. It's insanity.
it's Ireland when Protestants and Catholics were at war with each other. Our only hope is US voters/Dem party or GOP politicians realizing they've lost control of the Frankenstein and take their party back. https://t.co/O1YEzNOcFY

Something the base gops don't get: eloquence and command of issues. They love moronic phrases with negative slant. There are intelligent gops, but they're smart enough to stay silent and let the bottom dwellers do their thing. #word https://t.co/X6xloJlNgQ
@PatrickSvitek @tedcruz Moronic little phrases is all the gops can comprehend. If they have negative or violent connotations, even better.

@JLawPA Not saying FDI isn't a good thing, of course that's how global economy works. Talking about Saudi and Russian blood money from autocratic regimes. Surely everyone can agree that $$ talks and any policy, value, moral or ethical concern can be bought and we should do better
@toknobbit exactly
@JLawPA Sorry to be unclear. My point is that the nationalism people espouse doesn’t extend to caring about how much foreign money and influence is corrupting the US. If you can’t tweet at me without insults then don’t bother.
So, I think I understand now: It's OK for major US assets to be bought by Saudi &amp; Russian riches. And basically, if immigrants coming illegally over border had the money to pour into their coffers, GOP would be fine w/no wall, no documents.
sick, brutal, brazen coverup by Trump, Pompeo, Kushner. no doubt. https://t.co/kIKJSpMWqN
@BILLKEYWEST They will NEVER do the right thing or take the righteous side if money is involved.
@RLanetteS @johnpavlovitz I have a little bit of the last one: feeling worried abt situations, events. Things like kids in cages, gutting earned programs, people dying w/out healthcare, women losing body autonomy, nuclear war, economy crashes, deficits, murder coverups for Saudi $ ~ to name just a few
@KennethWReid @johnpavlovitz I'm sorry. stay in the now. I suffer mainly when I imagine the future years, how I'd possibly handle 6 more years of this clown/nightmare show
@johnpavlovitz Yes. Struggling w anxiety and never have before. I’m going to go lose myself in making some music
@KariCares4U @BrookeBCNN I used the word “mob” as a joke because Cruz used it in the debate, along with every other fear baiting tactic the GOP relies on to keep the base riled up and scared of their fellow Americans.
@survivecollapse I don't watch cable news or TV. I read reports from a variety of legitimate sources, both US &amp; worldwide perspective. I'm grateful each day for my blessings, yet still able to have compassion &amp;concern for those less fortunate who are going to suffer most under these policies.

STOP calling millions and millions of United States citizens an angry "mob." Your fearful and violence inciting rhetoric is DANGEROUS. @realDonaldTrump  @PressSec
@IamCoznoz @DaveOnTap @royalviking04 You and all MAGA people are the most hateful, bigoted, misogynistic individuals the rest of the country has experienced. your leader holds power for now. Minorities have been subjected to your mindset for ages, bless them. Look at who you follow to see unbridled hate
@IamCoznoz God kills babies every day, and your beliefs kill women. So, you're a hypocrite. Have a nice evening, I'm done here.
@IamCoznoz @DaveOnTap @royalviking04 How sad are you about the children who are unwanted, uneducated, uncared for, can't get medical help, can't get adopted, have addict or incarcerated parents? You best be spending lots of time, effort and money helping them if you care so much about babies being born.
@IamCoznoz Women will never have equality if they don't have the self determination to make major decisions abt their careers, homes, families and lives. No woman wants to have an abortion, believe me. But it must remain an option if men aren't going to share responsibility. and they don't.
@IamCoznoz @DaveOnTap @royalviking04 https://t.co/kRsLQTcXnt
Dude has picked the WRONG FUCKING time to tango about this. So sick of men like him and Bratt and Donnie and Mitch and Chuck and Orrin and Ted and John and ALL OF THEM  #RiseUp https://t.co/rGzNHTLPIO
@IamCoznoz and, if the young girl you got pregnant thought of abortion, and wanted one instead of making your irresponsibly deposited sperm wad into a baby, she should be able to. If things were the other way around, you'd all be crying for legal abortions.
@IamCoznoz Exactly. Government has no place telling a woman when she should have to put her body through excruciating pain. You have no argument for YOU taking responsibility to NOT get a woman pregnant. Get a freaking vasectomy, all of you. No more abortions. end of story.
No, you don't know how it works at all. A woman has as much right to sex as you do to stick your dick wherever you want. Government mandated condoms or vasectomies bring EXACT SAME results as what you say you want--no abortions. Why won't you argue for that? Too INCONVENIENT?? https://t.co/cuSHFPpTAt
@IamCoznoz @royalviking04 This is where we differ on what the difference is between a baby and a fertilized egg--which would never be fertilized without sperm, therefore a man has no right to order a woman to grow the zygote into a baby using her body.
@IamCoznoz @royalviking04 I suggest you read this thread and find one valid argument against it. https://t.co/NJhf9FiMhI
@IamCoznoz @royalviking04 Shouldn’t men like you get vasectomies if you are against the right of a woman to have an abortion? Your rich republican ladies will still be getting them, safely. The poor will suffer
@IamCoznoz @royalviking04 what are you most excited about? Stripping away LBGTQ rights, forcing women to carry babies to term, or removing all obstacles for corporations and the wealthiest to make more money at the expense of health, planet and least fortunate? Or is it the protection for Trump?
Senator Cornyn, I am a constituent, native Texan. Where's the evidence that anyone was paid to do this?

To vote NO &amp; confirm another conservative justice seems like a no brainer. But doing so would demoralize the base. The GOP is terrified of midterms &amp; losing control. This "win" will energize the base. Drunk w/power &amp; lib ownage, they will flock to polls. CRUCIAL FOR DEMS TO VOTE!

A conservative SCOTUS was a given, once Trump won. We knew that. To frame this confirmation in power abuse and the disregard &amp; subjugation of women by the GOP was unimaginable. Let this be a bellwether moment in our country. If not now, when?
2016 voters, we all tried to say THIS is the main issue. But, we never dreamed it would play out in such an egregious, corrupt, unjust and painful way.

Say something nice about your opponent, Beto says he respects Cruz service and sacrifice. Cruz says. me me me then, he respects Beto's passion for socialism, like Bernie Sanders-. #TeamBeto responds: True to form. BOOM
"You tell me who can miss half their days at work and still be rehired for their job" #TeamBeto abt Cruz missing Senate votes. Cruz evokes Bogeyman Soros, Pelosi, HRC every chance he gets whether it's relevant to question or not.
"how you respond to Trump insulting your wife and dad is your business. how we respond to Trump insulting our US institutions with Putin is our business" (paraphrased) #TeamBeto
"Thoughts and prayers aren't going to save kids, we need action" #TeamBeto
cruz doesn't answer question when asked if unarmed POC being shot by police is a problem in this country.
Beto says economy will benefit with Dreamers, favors earned path to citizenship. Cruz says build the wall, deport. Tough questions. #TeamBeto
@janewiedlin have a great show! is that shot from Art at the SF premiere of HOH??

Sharing this message from #TeamBeto re social media posts on debate. Exemplifies the positive, reflects his entire campaign. "BE KIND &amp; HAVE FUN-- This is a huge opportunity for Beto, for Texas. We're not here to pick fights. We just want to boost our great candidate!" https://t.co/UAX0EsOcAK
@JLawPA How on earth does a gun registry or a background check hurt a law abiding person? Please simply explain. My dad owned 6 guns &amp; had no problem w/any law that regulated firearms. Also, again: TX doesn't require private sellers&amp;gun shows to initiate background check to sell firearms
@Kju1964 Yes, I'm still working on it, should have final draft by end of year
@gogosguy @TheDebr1 @agneimanis @janewiedlin lol! I know who has the rights to our records. #royalties I was joking about who is "they" : )
@janewiedlin @TheDebr1 Who is "they"??? We need to have a talk with them!
@janewiedlin @jonathanpalmer_ @officialgogos @HOHmusical I'm going next Friday 9/28, you should come Yane
@JLawPA TX has no law requiring firearms dealers to initiate background checks. Handgun license holders in TX are exempt from fed background check requirement when purchasing a handgun.TX doesn't require private sellers or gun shows to initiate background check when transferring firearms
A mother loses her daughter to gun violence and the Senator who refuses to even consider background checks for gun purchases lets this happen?? https://t.co/Eu6d09dlpC

@Snets99 @benchten I could be wrong, but from my understanding, Ford was unwilling to be named, which puts reveal at a disadvantage. you're right, Garland was treated terribly &amp; left a very bad taste so there's a case for "payback." But Kavanaughs past suggests some contempt for women
@Snets99 @benchten I think that's why she wanted an investigation, to ask witnesses as to whether he was there, determine if lies are being told. He has exhibited actions that make Dem women worry about equality and misogyny. I get that Rs nominate conservative judges.
@Snets99 @benchten Fords coming forth isn't the only strike, there is possible perjury &amp; the normal protocols of doc examination were shorted. Obviously the main Dem/GOP conflict re this confirmation is RoevWade concerns. Which is a topic unto itself
@Snets99 @benchten This isn't "payback"-his confirmation falls in an era where women now ask men to be accountable for acts or aggression &amp; intimidation, whenever they happened. It's abt character, responsibility. A SCOTUS judge should have both. Surely adult you recognizes &amp; regrets wrongful acts.
it was such a privilege to see Earl play at Chadneys in Burbank with his jazz trio. The best memories from that time https://t.co/frKb5qhNT0

Reasonable Rs know: a balance of power is necessary for Democracy to function as our founding fathers intended. Until GOP went full bonkers during @POTUS44 2nd term, bi-partisanship&amp;compromise were norm. It's in ALL of our best interests to work together to return to those norms. https://t.co/w1If0LMdNw
@JackieFox1976 Hey Jackie!! ❤️ too long since we connected
Sometimes, if you get really quiet, you can hear the rustle of hush money checks being issued by terrified studio &amp; tv execs who used their position to coerce women for sexual favors or be sidelined into non-careers.  I've heard plenty of stories, wondering when their time is up
@_CarterRedd @MJW_resist @webradius @SenatorCollins I'm referring to the protocols of confirming a SCOTUS judge. They've gone out the window for this guy. No one is trying to get an indictment for her story. There's a statute and it's not provable.
@_CarterRedd @MJW_resist @webradius @SenatorCollins Why? There doesn't need to be an indictment. Just the normal protocols would suffice. If he stands up after going through what every other justice has gone through, so be it.
@_CarterRedd @MJW_resist @webradius @SenatorCollins He's not being charged with a penal offense-he's about to be appointed for life to the highest court in the land. After showing little regard for women in other instances, perjuring himself, no document oversight. It's enough to #DelayKavanaughVote
.@SenatorCollins Many women, D&amp;R, recall being teens in exact place as Christine Blasey Ford--getting cornered, felt up, dry humped &amp; worse. None of us should stand for her being labeled a liar. Many of us have teen daughters who go to parties. What message do we want to send?

@ArdolinoAmber 1. idiot. 2. rude. 3. fuck them and love you!!!
@KevinPo41997393 @janewiedlin then their solution needs to involve men, and not punishing women. I believe the GOP agenda is to keep poor, minority women out of the work force, compromised and non-voting. I don't believe the evangelicals issue is human life either. It's about women being unequal to men. 2/2
@KevinPo41997393 @janewiedlin I don't think she is saying all men are "bad" or poorly behaved. The point is that women's rights to have a say as to whether she carries an unwanted pregnancy to term is under siege by the "pro-life" evangelicals &amp; GOP. If their agenda is truly stopping abortions 1/2
@petrahaden day made
@rosannecash @AmericanaFest I cried reading this. love you Rose.
@AngryBlackLady Every single time I suggest government laws requiring condoms to righteous anti-abortion men they say I'm ridiculous/absurd. Gabrielle has articulated these facts eloquently and perfectly. Thank you. I'm showing my 15yr-old daughter this entire thread.
This entire thread is what I've always thought and what I always argue---however I've never laid it out so incredibly and thoughtfully. Read it all. Men can eliminate all need for abortions. NOT by policing women's bodies. (thx to @AngryBlackLady for posting) https://t.co/NJhf9FiMhI

@EthanSVG @clem_burke @BlondieOfficial @Chicago_Reader yep. It hurts
@lornadiane1 @Chicago_Reader @JAKEandRATSO this is a widely read free rag and you're right, I hate giving them any publicity or bringing attention to the stupid story. but it it so wrong. This is a perfect example of what Trump has brought our country to. Belittling and taunting.
This is @clem_burke. When he's not drumming w/@BlondieOfficial he drums w/other bands 'coz it makes him happy&amp;whole. He's on a short list of people I can count on for anything, anytime. The @Chicago_Reader published an article saying he had "Trump Face,"appearance shaming #WTF 😡 https://t.co/ENKpX6Ya5H
Furious at @Chicago_Reader @JAKEandRATSO for mean spirited, public platform bullying a beloved musician who happens to be in his 60s &amp; GOD FORBID, aging. #ClemBurke doesn't look like fucking Trump you assholes &amp; even if he did it's still not ok to publish your spiteful "story"
@Chicago_Reader WTF is wrong with @Chicago_Reader &amp; @Jakeandratso publishing this? You targeted &amp; publically shamed a human being who looks nothing like Trump. Compared an innocent guy to a man universally accepted as hideous. Taunted him for his age and appearance. Lowest of the low bullies
@clem_burke Hey Jake Austen @JAKEandRATSO I hope you're happy trying to make a human being's appearance into a shits and giggles stupid piece of writing. How dare you? How would you like someone to go after your son this way?
@ShawnTexas1968 I don't think it comes off as liking him. It looks like veiled hostility and outrageously vindictive--for what I don't know. Maybe he got slighted when he was sucking up to Blondie one time
Meanwhile, people like Les Moonves raked in $70 mil A YEAR in salary. Here's something I do for fun sometimes. Go on @YahooFinance, pick any company. Any. Obscure small one is great. Click on symbol. Then click "profile." Check out CEO salary. Marvel at the need for such wealth. https://t.co/tXIN5EJPnx
@clem_burke the guy who wrote it is @JAKEandRATSO on twitter. Not sure why he's so vindictive and hostile, it's a really odd use of a platform and it's hard to believe a respectable publication would run such an offensive piece
@RamsesTMagnum @officialgogos @MTV @DavidBowieReal @IggyPop @janewiedlin All of the Go-Go's are huge Bowie fans! Who on Earth isn't?
@JAKEandRATSO wtf was that piece comparing Clem's appearance to Trump about? What did he do to you? Do you think Johnny Marr looks like Trump too? Paul McCartney? What is wrong with you attacking someone's appearance publicly? Asshole.
@clem_burke what an absurd comparison. Trump has a butthole mouth, frog eyes, a scalp tuck w/bleached combover &amp; oozes evil narcissism from every pore. Clem on the other hand has a nice mouth, kind eyes, gorgeous hair and good natured enjoyment of his talents. That writer is a stupid fuck.
it's 9/12 today, not 9/11, but I didn't see this til now. A list of lawmakers who voted AGAINST the First Responders 9/11 bill. Notice the party @GOP, same hypocrites who claim to be patriots, and check their tweets from yesterday. https://t.co/jAooCvgO73

Their social media person, oversight person or editorial process needs replacing https://t.co/pWjPA6qHiJ
@CBSNews OMG. With your "correction" you've now managed to restate the offensive and false headline 2 more times. Wtf is going on there??
@peterack @CBSNews I don’t use that phrase, I believe it’s a harmful trope invented to perpetuate FUD and destroy democracy. @cbsnews either knowingly or stupidly wrote a bad headline
@CBSNews MASSIVE FAIL @CBSNews -congrats on making a false, reductive soundbite out of arguably the most eloquent statement that has been made about the peaceful protest of racism and injustice by these athletes.
@DJDarren4 Don't get many comments like this, THANK YOU! xx
@realDonaldTrump Still having a lot of fun?
@DaveStewart I was thinking today how you and John B were doing email in 1986 and tried to explain it to me and I could not grasp it. At all.
@AlexBorstein I miss you Alex, the only time I see you is on billboards in LA. Will you be there in NYC next weekend for reals?
@Lindoots @HOHmusical Yes definitely. I love the show and doubt I will ever get tired of seeing it!
@jeaniecopes @HOHmusical of course! message me
@Onjimsmind @HOHmusical you buy a ticket, I'll buy a drink
@Craigct5 @HOHmusical I'll be there! In lobby, before and after
@nordique1972 @HOHmusical evening
I'm going to the Saturday Sept 1 show of @HOHmusical -join me for a drink in the lobby!  #HeadOverHeels ❤️⚡️🎭🌈🎶🥁 https://t.co/ZspQdbWhlz
watched @BetoORourke gain over 100k followers today. the MOMENTUM is huge&amp;exciting. BUT. Cruz, GOP, &amp; their corporate overlords will spend millions to smear &amp; discredit as his chances of winning grow. Beto raises 💰 from people not PACs.Please consider supporting his campaign!

@iowahawkblog Caddy for the win on the drives to Palm Springs!
@iowahawkblog right on, lets see pics if you get it! I can't believe I don't have better pictures of mine. I got these from Denny.
@iowahawkblog  thought you might enjoy these pics of me and my Rivi! https://t.co/kk2EmSOkUA
@realDonaldTrump Good lord, he's trying to be clever with the ICE/ISIS wordplay now.
By now everyone has RTd and watched this I hope. And it should be noted that the recognition @BetoORourke gets is from being genuine, respectful, willing to talk and listen--not from PACbux $$ paying for and buying negative ads. #RealDeal https://t.co/3OgdfBszdC
@Kerry_Dougherty no that would mean he'd have to actually look at and read classified info!
@twittmanda Awww, didn't know you were friends with her. ❤️💔
@TedBThompson @officialgogos @HOHmusical @dutsch1 fantastic! I'm going back soon too
@twittmanda that sounds nice, but who is Brenda?
@CheetahdaveDave omg, you're right! Wish I could tweet in that voiceover voice
went offline to do some uninterrupted writing and, WOW. a lot has happened! what desperate and dangerous diversion will that deceitful grifting POS conjure up now??

Today would have been my dads 85th birthday. We spent the last 8 months of his life mending the past, releasing regret, forgiving and loving, until he died 5/11/18. I’m grateful for what we had but wish we were celebrating this birthday together. https://t.co/Z96QmQYl3v
@BridgidOD I have a friend who was there on that tour, and many musicians know the full story, not what the supposed "victim" keeps going to the press with!
@HoustonianAngry go see the film! it's great, you'd probably really like it
@BILLKEYWEST let me know your reaction. xxlove u Bill
@BridgidOD @bstettin He spit on Ness, was disrupting show, harassing all 3 bands on the bill. A NeoNazi looking to cause trouble. Artists are supposed to keep their mouths shut and perform? Punk rock ones at that? Never heard that rule.
@TonyRenner @jessedayton @BootsRiley @Sorry2BotherYou It's an excellent story &amp; hugely important film, urge you not to miss it! The intensity is something we should experience. Until WP fully accept, acknowledge &amp; act upon POC lives &amp; reality, society will continue to devolve.
Best picture #Blackkklansman #Masterpiece GO. Everyone go. This IS America.
@MaroonedInMarin He's from El Paso not Ireland. it's a nickname-some people actually grew up w/Latino pals. But if the name a good candidate goes by is the most important issue in your life, you have a privilege few can claim. Hope you troll Rafael Cruz supporters just as hard.
@MaroonedInMarin @peterframpton I support a candidate using whatever fucking name he wants as long as he cares about veterans, jobs, healthcare and education, and shows up, unafraid to meet constituents or take questions and criticisms.

@psbysp @BetoORourke @AndyKimNJ awesome! 🇺🇸
Just canvassed door to door for @BetoORourke. 1st time to do this &amp; discovered: It made a difference &amp; gets easier really fast. Face to face engagement is SO important. A LOT of people uninformed, apathetic. Being real, going off script works best. https://t.co/zowldTWdH6
the incredible night @officialgogos got to play and help #MohammadAli raise $ &amp; awareness for Parkinsons w/ #RobinWilliams @JimCarrey @MagicJohnson countless others. So many amazing memories I could fill a vault w/ TBT's and FBFs! https://t.co/J28kSvVPfR
@Jimmy93756504 as I said, I wish I hadn't commented but I'd been up late writing, tired, and love me some Social D so just put it out there w/out thinking about the political action I was endorsing. I agree 100% w you and thank you for respectful engagement here.
@Jimmy93756504 tbh, I wish I'd never commented, but I'll stand by what I said &amp; just finish w/this: you're right! but there's also more to this than this guys story. He was a massive threatening neoNazi looking for a fight, spitting on a performer. He knew Ness wasn't gonna take that.
@alolmost @laurenduca @WeDemandJustice @wendydavis No Roe=telling a woman she must carry a pregnancy to term IS controlling her body. No access=unsafe procedures, deaths. Keeping the poor w/out options. Privileged will still get them easily.
@alolmost @laurenduca @WeDemandJustice @wendydavis Advocate for education, healthcare, etc for already born&amp;hopeless. There are actual babies and children that need your passion &amp; commitment! The adult responsibility you demand is not shared by men, therefore unequal, oppressive to women.
@bstettin @jessedayton I agree. I'm a lover not a fighter. But didn't you like it just a tiny bit, for instance, when NeoNazi Richard Spencer got clocked on film that time? 😇👊🏼
@bstettin @jessedayton @mikeness @SocialD1 @JonnyTwoBags that's what I'd do. but... a)performers are vulnerable, exposed onstage. fans don't realize what that's like. b)touring's exhausting-show is the fun part and he was ruining that c)tough guys who fuck w/other tough guys might get punched and they know it when they do it
@RWitherspoon @HOHmusical This Go-Go (and my daughter) LOVE you @Rwitherspoon, have shared many wonderful hours enjoying your films. Hope you love @HOHmusical and thank you for getting the word out!
@alolmost @laurenduca @WeDemandJustice @wendydavis No, protecting rights for women to self determine their own bodies and destiny. Mandated condoms and voluntary vasectomies would help unwanted pregnancies, maybe you could make that your cause?
@Jimmy93756504 Assault is never ok, but when a huge tough guy is antagonizing, provoking and disrupting a performance, some artists might take issue with it. That the big toughie boohoos to the press to wallow in his 15 min of attention&amp;fame is telling.
I’m at #RiseUpForRoe with @laurenduca @wedemandjustice @wendydavis et al https://t.co/7f6OlptoGg
@AllisonSommer1 He's onstage trying to put on a great show for the fans and one huge tough guy is antagonizing and ruining it, so my guess is he felt provoked and threatened. Being onstage performing puts artist in a vulnerable place. But, overreact, yea maybe
@PDHSki @mikeness @SocialD1 @JonnyTwoBags no but have had people who clearly aren't enjoying themselves who seem to want to stay and let you know that
How lucky we are to have the gift of ArethA https://t.co/v3Xv0yTkNX
yaaasss, @mikeness rules, no band or musician has to put up with a fuck you guy in front of you. @SocialD1 @JonnyTwoBags https://t.co/4tnzbQXb2l
@officialgogos the solid gold dancers are bustin some moves!
@Amy_Siskind Legitimizing Sarah Palin, putting her on a national stage did nothing positive for women or the US. Just a gateway drug to Trump with her moronic bs. More importantly, WOC are the greatest allies we can have. WW going to do what they do. WOC got the fire
@lizzwinstead @Amy_Siskind @AngryBlackLady it begs the question--would she (Amy S) be supporting Trump if he was a woman? Her hero Palin paved the way for him.

@FollowingTrend @iowahawkblog I’m a guitar slinger not a singer, never used Botox, might be washed up but what a great career. you MrCrankypants need to find better ways to pass your time than trolling pals who manage despite dif views to maintain basic human respect and courtesy. In other words fuck off
@Onjimsmind @janewiedlin @officialgogos oh for goodness sake. I'm very comfortable with my appearance, it was a lighthearted, self-deprecating comment. the goofy emoticon is used to illustrate that intent.
@janewiedlin @rjheldmann @CBSSunday @officialgogos @HOHmusical Yes indeed, takes nothing away from the Runaways or Fanny (before them) or Debutants (before both of them.) kudos to all women music “pioneers.” But none of those bands had hits they wrote (or didn’t write even) that went to top of charts
@janewiedlin @officialgogos was that me? I thought it was an imposter with a double chin 🤪  seriously, thank you Fraulein! ❤️⚡️🤟🏼

@iantracy79 @Brixsmithstart @clem_burke good point Sir, well taken. opens up a great dialogue. I think perhaps it's common not because one is using as a slur, but because they are both anti-gay. the image&amp;idea would get under their skin. it's more the BDSM subservience aspect, but the 2 players are men, so.
@TheRealTeeMarie this makes me cry. how could we go from such decency and class to such an abyss of stupid and evil

@SandraHelena39 @NekoCase I'm not refusing to grasp anything, I remain open and willing to learn and educate myself and do the best I can to gather info. Maybe I'm not in the know as much as you are, but it's certainly not from "refusing to grasp."
@popscribe @NekoCase I think you're right: same mistakes will be made by the same "we." So the "we" needs to be different. BUT. GOP think tanks worked for decades ensuring Dem "we" got gerrymandered, jailed, marginalized, repressed. it's corrupt. &amp; so FUCKEDUP
@NekoCase All this popular vote vs EC, non-voters, 3rd party voters stuff is practically irrelevant compared to the fact that a diabolical, frightening and far-reaching picture has emerged: The GOP must, will, &amp; did destroy Democracy, norms, institutions to win and stay won.

@HouseOfRakes if it all blurred together I'd have a hard time writing. fortunately it didn't, and I recall tons of events and moments vividly and clearly. Totally Go-Go's was exciting, but the locale seemed odd to me. I didn't get why a high school. 😘
did a 9 city van tour in Germany w/@dominiquediva and #GinaSchock and played to literally nobody night after night. We laughed so much, constantly, I laugh still remembering how much I laughed. Remains one of the highlights of my musical career. Go figure. https://t.co/pAIzui5rYE

@Moonspinner55 yes that's when I met Jodie!
@midlifemixtape I don’t know, the font or lettering is kind of cool. Not for a cover but like that font
@janewiedlin ZIGGYSTARDUST
@Lesdoggg seems like you meet the right guy when you're perfectly happy without him
@ClockHush Thank you for such a lovely message, made my day!

@chuckmoffat @vulture it's his experience and remembrances, without regard to sacred cows. doesn't stop me from loving the Beatles!
@EugeneAustin everyone is focused on the Brando/Pryor stuff. His comments about jazz and music and so much else...love him sharing his life experience
Best interview I've ever read. @vulture https://t.co/e2n3Ktgayz
OMG I ❤️ @QuincyDJones having zero fucks to give.
@dwuori I'm pleased that those shows went so well, and I'm VERY happy with "Hourglass" --thank you for listening.

@k_rad AA worked for me--I understand having trouble with HP. I pretty much ignored that part. Focused on service to others, amends, daily self reflection, honest appraisal of actions and words. I rarely go now, haven't for years. But still utilize the steps
@megsamthx you went to Radford?!
@mrdeepockets it goes fast!! road gets narrower though, all that stuff = true
@DCdebbie that's solid! it flies by, omg. can't believe it.
HEY! forgot to say: Yesterday, 29 years sober. If you think you might have a problem, pay attention. Honor your higher self, and know there is help, and hope, and a day at a time, freedom from addiction. ❤️⚡️🤘
@leasdef Hi Kasey!
@MarkBranson18 yes. you’re right forgiveness and tolerance are best practiced. I wasn’t presuming to know God, I just got annoyed with her righteousness.
@drewscherz hi Drew! that about nails it!
@BenHillmon I wasn’t equating in amounts, just some organizations seem to focus on wealth. Scientology probably has billions though!
and here is the essence of humanity's failure to evolve. I just can't comprehend why any individual, corporation or church needs to single-mindedly amass vast amounts of wealth. Nothing can grow infinitely without squeezing everything else out. https://t.co/HeNyaLTVBb
Reductive thinking. Women's march isn't a 1 issue cause. We march 4 solidarity: against policies, injustice, misogyny, oppression, bigotry, racism. We march for freedom &amp; equality. To support BLM, DACA, CHIP. For health care, environment, education, the poor. https://t.co/t1tAu4myrE
@dhruval_1 Women are strong and able to work hard, support and care for families, make progress in life, have full careers, be productive and creative. And still make time to exercise their right to protest laws and policies they disagree with. Your trolling is a waste of time.
That's @wendydavis up front. Her and @DonnaHowardTX gave great speeches at the rally. "Change comes when Mama Bear gets mad!" https://t.co/8Y8ZQA8kpA

@royalviking04 because he’s a good guy and did what was best for him and family and party w/lynch mob after him. Ethics investigation would have been enough.This is a side show. The country is being raped, robbed &amp; assaulted while an imperfect but great politician goes down
@royalviking04 1 said he grabbed her waist &amp; squeezed in the photo. not harassment. 2 said he "tried" to kiss them-of those, 1 said he was walking towards her like he was "going to kiss her." Read the Moore accusations &amp; decide for yourself what's harassment &amp; what isn't https://t.co/InmVdjhlzR
@royalviking04 I've read all the details &amp; find some sketchy info. As someone who has done tons of meet&amp;greets and photo ops, I can say that they are very quick &amp; awkward. Sometimes to put people at ease, the celeb can be playful. Ass grabbing is not ok, like 3 said, but possibly misconstrued
A lot of extreme black &amp; white reaction to some questionable gray area recollections and accusations. Party needs to work to defeat Moore before running out #Franken
@BridgidOD cool coincidence!
@happyfacemalts wow! if I cross Bobs path I will tell him all about it ; )

@realchristaylor thanks Chris, and you!
the guy at the bagel store called me "miss" instead of "ma'am." it's going to be a good day.
@Newsweek this is nonsense. It's not that similar, and the word "better" is hardly something you steal from another slogan. it's just a word

@bjdzyak @ReaganWorld wearing a low cut dress isn't exposing breasts. do you get harassed if you wear jeans that accentuate your junk? Didn't think so.😂
@bjdzyak @ReaganWorld I'm not blaming men for being attracted to women-that's absurd. He states that women should expect harassment if they wear a low cut dress.
@bjdzyak @ReaganWorld point wasn't to equivocate. it was taking, to an extreme, the notion that a given person is responsible for another person's conduct
@angrykittenpaws @ReaganWorld I'm sorry, I didn't think about that. Reactive to his idiocy.

@macgeek1969 @filmystic the % would be the same, the amt would be vastly different-which I think was his point; ie, why should anyone be embarrassed at lesser tax $

wow nuclear level meltdown going on Twitter tonight from @RogerJStoneJr
@NBCNews #DearMrPresident even if you weren't a cheating, lying, tax-evading, fraud, you'd still be unfit to lead this country, in every regard.

@American_Guy_NY @SWEETY16A go away "Sweety" unlike you, American Guy seems to be conversant with words and able to discuss differences
@American_Guy_NY you may not like him, but Obama won 2 elections with no help from Russia--unlike your billionaire puppet overlord

@becasilverstein really? and how much time do you spend researching facts? oh wait, you need to be able to think critically to do that, never mind
@Bluebugaboo2 @becasilverstein @bfraser747 what kind of patriot is proud of PUTIN?! you do know that DJT would've happily been Dem/Lib win if we were the ones supporting him? #truth
@thebellygod you're on the wrong twitter TL-shouldn't you be reading breitbart, listening to infowars &amp; lapping up your cult leader's lies?
@cindi_kennedy @lauriemallen not being a mindless cult follower to a treasonous dipshit is one of my strongest points. nice try, now go RT the endless lies &amp; BS you read
@iowa_trump an unfounded quote w/no source other than repetition on right-wing web sites&amp;blogs. neither Jarrett nor her parents are Iranian, nor Muslim.
@BobInMichigan45 that's exactly what he thinks of you &amp; all his supporters. If liberals had backed him, he'd be all about MAGA w/left policies #opportunist
@fancy_spancy_22 it's not FROM Podesta-you're spreading lies. it's an email FROM orca100 TO JP email. It's a long-winded spam &amp; primarily anti-Dem rhetoric
@awnesty0117 you're fighting patriots who don't want hostile foreign governments working in our elections. patriots who want to preserve the constitution

@Zeta_Stryker no you've been conned. he has 1 interest fueled by his narcism &amp; ego. he is a puppet to Bannon and Putin. wait &amp; see.
@Zeta_Stryker you mean this guy, right? https://t.co/bVHv3v4X3H
@Zeta_Stryker You have no reading comprehension skills, indicating poor level of intelligence. Quick look at TL confirms. So sorry for you.

I did an interview with #TravelDetective @PeterSGreenberg today from @lakeaustinspa! here we are with friend &amp;PR whiz @dfiske https://t.co/3rnZFAE0Ro
@marlareagan63 i blocked you because you're an illiterate lying hateful person.
@marlareagan63 no one cares Hillary lost. and you just proved yourself incapable of reading comprehension
@marlareagan63  I tried to engage with you &amp; you twist my words to make me look bad when my intentions were clear. done. enjoy your day.
@marlareagan63 i said i DONT judge millions based on the actions of few.
@marlareagan63 you misread. i did not say that at all. i said the opposite
@marlareagan63 the president let Putin and Russia infiltrate our security and you're worried about Madonna?!
@marlareagan63 i did not see those images because i get my news from reputable journalism. any crowd of 100k is going to have some nuts
@marlareagan63 I don't judge millions of conservatives based on the actions of extreme right wingers who hate blacks and worship hitler
@marlareagan63 this is from a right leaning paper: https://t.co/MEfuHkwr75
@marlareagan63 the women's march was the largest in entire US history &amp; also took place around the world. not 1 arrest or act of violence.
@marlareagan63 if you look at this thread, you'll see where hate's coming from. I try everyday to have a connection w/someone on your side.
@bapruger77 i hope everyone tires of that. there are millions of libs&amp;cons, neither are going anywhere. I want a govt that can work for both
@bapruger77 also, appreciate not being name-called, thank you for responding like humans are supposed to
@bapruger77 I didn't hear any address that started that way, but I had issues w/that presidency2. Agree with you leadership, system broken
@bapruger77 I'd be happy with a good, old fashioned Conservative--many in my family share your beliefs but can't tolerate this fool
@bapruger77 here's your troll of a "leader" --the most finger pointing, blaming, crybaby, whining, complaining president ever. https://t.co/RzRCxtv0uQ
@marlareagan63 what's it feel like to be so hateful? have you always been this way or did the whiny babyman president bring it out of you?
only thing wrong with this one is it should be #Putin holding babyman @realDonaldTrump but still FUNNY AF https://t.co/KZD4uk7c1a
@2bblest whatever makes you feel smart honey, go for it. watch Fox, listen to Alex Jones, read Breitbart and share memes. good plan.

@cali4tune @EddieWyatt1963 #TillersonExxonInvadeUkraineContolCrimeaPeninsulaTaxFreeOil Connect the dots, you have your guys narrative.
@realDonaldTrump their job is to fight espionage, they have no choice when Congress refuses to act
@EddieWyatt1963 I keep trying to reason with them but all they do is name call like broken parrot records
@brianartist5 nah just a sign of the times! I keep getting called snowflake, libtard, etc

@cali4tune @realDonaldTrump someone sounds like a parrot
@dnricketts what do you mean? buyers remorse for what? I despise Trump
@PaulDavidBuckn3 have a good day Paul! take care of yourself, you made my day too!
@PaulDavidBuckn3 what we just did is what people need to do.We still disagree, but we tried to listen &amp; understand. much respect for you sir
@PaulDavidBuckn3 you too, Americans have amazing freedoms and rights, let's keep it that way. Thank you for your service!
@PaulDavidBuckn3 how is it that not one of you can see that you elected a dangerous moron? seriously.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 the largest in history. in cities all over the country and the world. it was amazing.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 wtf are you talking about? my real name is plan to see, at the beginning of your tweet. Stop with the name calling, jeez.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 the biggest protest in American history on January 21 had zero violence. Read a newspaper.
@Gitte35 @realDonaldTrump your POTUS is the whiner, you wake up fool
@FallingDog @jpvogt probably going to get audited this year! lol
@PaulDavidBuckn3 you're the one insulting people dude. you think Trump cares about you? that's the definition of delusional, right there
@PaulDavidBuckn3 all I hear from you is close mindedness, an inability to discuss actual facts instead of sweeping general opinions
@PaulDavidBuckn3 Redistricting to deny voting rights to POC is a GOP game. Not ratifying the ERA: GOP game. Climate change denying: GOP game
@PaulDavidBuckn3 I could copy and paste that, replacing liberal with conservative and have just as valid a case as you present.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 definitions of liberal in dictionary. it's not a term that insults me in the least.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 accord w/concepts of max individual freedom possible as guaranteed by law &amp; secured by govt protection of civil liberties.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 liberal: favoring or permitting freedom of action, especially with respect to matters of personal belief or expression:
@PaulDavidBuckn3 liberal: free from prejudice or bigotry. relating to representational forms of govt rather than aristocracies &amp; monarchies
@PaulDavidBuckn3 what I notice is corruption, greed&amp;tax evasion from rich fear&amp;blame from mid-class &amp; dehumanizing the poor-who's winning?
@PaulDavidBuckn3 totally agree. cheers, and have a good evening
@PaulDavidBuckn3 there's millions of people w/different ideas&amp;ways living in 1 country. important to find common ground, I try, you too, k?
@cynh9342 @PaulDavidBuckn3 I didn't like a lot of what Obama did. But delegitimizing our societal institutions is wrong &amp; dangerous.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 @williamlegate @BrendaB56 I just ask: instead of hating "libtards" focus on your candidate's tweets &amp; responses to US probs
@PaulDavidBuckn3 @williamlegate @BrendaB56 I am pissed at Dems, but that's over. What we're up against now is the rise of an autocrat.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 @williamlegate @BrendaB56 Liberals would have rallied to his cause if he'd act presidential, be a leader. Drain the swamp.
@PaulDavidBuckn3 @williamlegate @BrendaB56 you people think it's the winning that bothers us- but it's the lies, stupidity &amp; puppet-actions
@jpvogt hmmm. it looks like it's "attached" to me--I see my response with the others
@jpvogt not sure what you mean!
@realDonaldTrump we don't care. you think your bullshit Mark Cuban, Nordstrom, crowd size tweets will distract us? get a fucking clue

@USABigTee pros &amp;cons &amp; not sure i believe they cost us billions. anyway, i'm more concerned by US divisions &amp; thx for respectful listen!
@USABigTee so my initial tweet was more about refugee ban which is another issue, but I do think illegals do a lot of work we need done
@USABigTee is broken too. but they worked hard, paid taxes, saved $,hired lawyers &amp; became citizens. fine, honorable people w/strong family
@USABigTee i've known a few undoc immigrants who came illegally to escape horrible place, to make a better life. the system to help those
@USABigTee appreciate hearing your experience how it forms your opinions. I try to listen&amp;understand other views&amp;dont believe all i read
@USABigTee "you are obviously an idiot"-not a good way to have dialog. I have many GOPfriends I can discuss issues w &amp; not be insulted : )
@USABigTee which federal law? I hope name calling makes you feel like a big man, it certainly has no affect on me or my IQ
@USABigTee @Govtchecker @GregAbbott_TX I do not "tweet blindly"--but if I wanted to, that is legal too. POTUS does it non-stop!! lol! cheers
@USABigTee @Govtchecker @GregAbbott_TX I did read the law. state and local governments are NOT required to help the feds enforce federal law
@Govtchecker @GregAbbott_TX Let's enforce laws that are constitutional &amp; pro-American values. Officers don't need to be Trump EO henchmen.
@GregAbbott_TX @MyStatesman your petty, vindictive and misplaced retaliations towards Sally Hernandez show your true intent and character

@Cryn_Johannsen I'm not treating you like an idiot! I didn't understand your response. sorry you took anything the wrong way
@Cryn_Johannsen @VV4Change @MayaAMonroe and don't forget to follow https://t.co/nxbCKLE5DE to annoy the "president" peace!
@Cryn_Johannsen @VV4Change @MayaAMonroe I marched with diversity too, awesome day. I got something from her thread, you didn't, ok by me.
@Cryn_Johannsen @VV4Change @MayaAMonroe not sure you understand this was a long thread of maybe 20 tweets? there's no single "that" or case
please internet, can we make this happen? https://t.co/nxbCKLE5DE
Please read this thread. Not to take away from today's joy, but to remember if we need woc for solidarity&amp;numbers better show up for them 2 https://t.co/LfeKX0EQEe

@MayaAMonroe this is all hard to read TY for it I was all high from today, then boom, come across your thread&amp; u make me see new perspective
.@WindleRealty @whitesirenshows the traffic was no worse than when 60k go to ACL fest in a day or 100k go to Longhorns game.
@WindleRealty @whitesirenshows no blocked traffic, it was a permitted, organized march with plenty of advance notice to motorists
So proud to take my 14yr old daughter to her first march. It was a peaceful, inspiring day of solidarity and commitment from us here in ATX. https://t.co/W5GLdnCn0I

@tannenbaumr right? I'm willing to pay more so they can get an education, health care, security in their old age. But I'll pay less now.

@luv4photo @thebluebonnets love her!!! great pic
@JayGordonMDFAAP i had no idea that so many of his supporters held that view. i wish their prudence &amp;questioning carried over to his ethics
@LgFski Being an optimist in these times is a tall order but I try. was over the moon 2 days ago w/the dossier news, but we're still fuckd
@LgFski i guess I just look for any speck of hope I can. maybe Jared will get his Dem conscience back &amp; start advising in a good direction?
@AprilLeigh21 glad you are pleased with your goodies!
@LgFski that is Jared. The one married to Ivanka. His brother, Josh, seems to be a good guy
@mandini76 anyway what do I know maybe the whole family were DNC moles
@mandini76 that's Jared, not Josh
@nov8witness2016 @funder jeez what a cesspool it all is.
@funder Josh Kushner is lifelong Dem, family was disappointed in brother Jared's support of Trump. Call out the bad guys, not the good

@refoman50 ah so you're a nice guy deep down? : )
@refoman50 Tried to convey: Americans pay more attention to Mariah's stupid NYE messed up performance than to GOP gutting Ethics office.
Mariah still getting more attention. We're doomed as a culture &amp; I can't even blame @realDonaldTrump for that. He's the result not the cause https://t.co/5jfDg2ARkp

@occupycorruptDC @TEN_GOP Fake News isn't generated by legitimate news sources, not all Dems are liars. Sweeping judgments don't help US

@gregtutunjian It's probably not lost. I may have sold it to a Hard Rock Cafe somewhere. ugh. never occurred to me it would be sentimental
It's made by the ace himself, Mr. @DannyFerrington to my specs. I don't know what happened to it which makes me ill https://t.co/S1NKkFkdgK

@JimGinter and thank YOU for your devotion and loyalty, and for recognizing and never forgetting what a truly special band it was.
@JimGinter I listened to a live show from 1984 today Jim-I never do that! reminded me of how much changed after we split and BC went solo
@Shaedreams aw, thank you. I would have loved to be there
@HouseOfRakes haha! YOU think it's weird??? imagine how I feel, the shunned one
@HouseOfRakes thx Andy! I'm sure there'll be future stuff, I wouldn't fret too much. remember, there was 10 yrs of nada in the past 31 yrs.
@MarthaQuinn @thebluebonnets I know--I wish it was better quality. I love that interview!

@cornax ha! (you are joking right?)
@berryhill67kim @oreospeedwagon yes it is! I wrote it when I was 22 yrs old
@HouseOfRakes didn't write them off til they didn't ask me on last tour. nothing worse than being "fired" but the mean spiritedness astounds

@chuckmoffat it's going to happen. #fact
@SamBronkowitz nice! it was a great ride. actual reason I'm not touring is  they tried to "fire" me, a full equal partner so: messy. lawsuit
@Joseph100960 I hear that a lot. But I was there for the important years!
@SamBronkowitz stopped in 2012 to pursue a life of leisure. ⚡️😎

@zeldazonked I like your twitter feed, looks different than the usual. following : )
my dad, age 83, told me to tweet this: "Trump has his head so far up his own ass he farts when he speaks." I said that's a mighty fine tweet
@dolphinboy33 I know right? but I don't like them anymore after what they did. we had a good thing going!
@GlamCityRocker I think they just are having us play, no opener
@GlamCityRocker , what's the name of your band
@robdelaney I'm embarrassed I haven't seen Catastrophe, I have some catching up to do on your doings. Please keep me as your fan anyway
@snayl ha! nevah!
who can write when cute paws come creeping over the computer screen? https://t.co/2evygAOEKJ
@McElliMixer it is a series of different problems whereas I usually have none
@casperdrums @officialgogos all good, hope you had a blast : )
@AmazonHelp item I'm waiting for doesn't show up in Am acct. Paid for in APymts. No acct # there, no info. so much time/effort to sort!
@AmazonHelp been a series of frustrations. latest, a delivery notice w/out tracking/order #. AmazonPayments doesn't work w/Amazon acct. 1/2
@SouthwestAir thank you, was hoping to just go to the airport and pick it up, we're in a panic!
@SBak007 @amazon it's customer service, all the different agents that never follow up on issues that bothers me
@SouthwestAir we left our laptop on the flight when we got off plane in Austin last night. Please help? super important
@Kju1964 I'm sorry, all I have is my home address at the moment! new website coming in 2017 with contact address
@TanyaDonelly well hmph. next time I hope! wishing you a great tour : )
@Kju1964 I don't have an autograph address! but sometimes I do giveaways or signed CDs from my FB page https://t.co/rR29OUoMLa
@johnjflan my Delphines gone since 2002.  @thebluebonnets is the band I play in, check it out!
@TanyaDonelly are you playing Austin??
@Roseum3 yes that will be in my memoir! they used all our gear
@ctfromshawnee no you're not because I haven't played with them since 2012 : )
I miss LA. I have so many more friends here than in Austin.
@robertdienelt FWIW, it's Heels : ) I love the honda commercial!!
@PauletteKunisky you're right, you win! have a great day now
@PauletteKunisky It's joke silly, lighten up. it made my teenager happy--which matters, unlike your opinion.
