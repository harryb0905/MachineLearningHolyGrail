@gingersnap599 @AlexRitschel Can you please resend and put GINGER in the subject? I will make sure it gets taken care of. Thank you for your patience.
@greenieangel57 I am always open to it if the script is right. She was a pleasure to work with and Robert is a dear friend ;)
@ct0707 I'm not sure, but I will definitely keep you posted if I hear of anything.
@smiling3y3z @RealCherylLadd Thank you! Yes, I do 💜
@CeeLoGrey Right now I really love @coldplay and @AndreaBocelli. So much talent, such beautiful vocals!
@FalconEric012 I will see little bits here and there from time to time and they always will trigger a memory 💜 So many incredible memories from that show! #CharliesAngels
@navarrete_jesse He was everything could ask for in an actor, inspiring, talented and so giving! He was even more so as a man in general...an incredible family man, devoted...loving and honest!
@Jeff_Styles She calls me Mimi 💜
@imposterRob85 Yes, it was a very challenging role for me...some of that makeup would take 8+ hours to apply. Additionally, it was incredible and daunting to work with Robert Mitchum who I had watched since I was a small child. It was a special project and I will always cherish it.
@BobLiggett There are so many, but I really do love Gone With The Wind!
@CarolynMuse4 I started as a ballet dancer, which brought me to New York. Once I got to the city I started exploring opportunities in musical theater and in commercials. Next thing I knew I was reading at auditions. It's been an incredible journey 💜
@danielskipsey The casting team saw me on the show, "The Switch." I went out on an audition and ended up getting the part. Did you know that #KellyGarrett was initially supposed to be a red head, until they cast me? #CharliesAngels
@drinaldioficial We each had our own hair stylist who helped create our unique looks. Mine was Emma di Vittorio! She was so talented, I loved her so much 💜 #CharliesAngels
@bikinimowing I did some reality TV with Sheer Genius which was a lot of fun. I love the talent competition aspect, because otherwise I am too private to be on a reality show ;)
@loriloriCM Hitchcock movies are always favorites of mine, minus The Birds. I love the way he blended style and entertainment. He was a genius. When it comes to my work sometimes I like to re-watch things because of the great memories I have from filming.
@EmmaJan07708706 Yes and thank you...I loved them too! I think femininity is coming back and you will definitely see more dresses, skirts and some really beautiful blouses. @Kmart @Sears
@fergie672 Jesus Christ would be my first choice, but there are several people throughout history who I would love to have met.
@BuckMitchell11 @dbgottadance one of my favorite episodes of #CharliesAngels was "Angels In Chains." It stands out because of all the funny memories I have of us all being chained up together. There was so much laughter...a lot of work but, but more smiles. It was a great day.
@mallhopper Yes I have done my own stunts on certain projects. It really has depended on the part and the director. For example, my role in The Bourne Identity was very physical and I did most of my stunts myself for that movie.
@EmilyIZSavvy I'm so happy to hear that because I absolutely loved shooting it! The entire cast and crew made me feel so welcome.
@AlexRitschel You are so welcome!
@BerzyPeter Good morning Berzy!
@davidjmordell Hi from Los Angeles!
@gingersnap599 @AlexRitschel It should never take that long. Can you please confirm the email address you sent the request to?
I'm online now! Tweet me your questions with #AskJaclyn ;)

I hope you all had a wonderful #ValentinesDay celebrating love in your life. Did you know that Brad and I have... https://t.co/WkyDDxNJKs https://t.co/XdkWfUOIxP
@bluebird2tweet Have a wonderful day ;)
@jaguarin66 @KFMovieGuy Angels in Chains is one of my favorite episodes because of the memories I have of shooting it. We were actually chained together, we laughed and joked all day. It is something I will always treasure. #CharliesAngels
@brewerdj Dance was always my first passion. If acting hadn't worked out I would absolutely have gone back to it.
@TheDanTheMan58 &lt;3
@CMLeverette Thank you for this beautiful message! I don't have anything scheduled yet, but keep checking in. I always post my scheduled appearances on social media. Have a wonderful day Chante!!
@barrman hello!
@PhilEx @Kazlwells It's beautiful! Great work @Kazlwells!!
@danielskipsey Delicious!
@pruss34 @RealCherylLadd Absolutely and we catch whenever possible. I just saw @RealCherylLadd the other day, we always have a wonderful time together. You can see a photo we took here: https://t.co/GwcK3VGsyR
@LisaOKray @donwan77 I never say never. If the script is right I am always open to new projects and yes we have stayed in touch. Our schedules can all be very full but we see each other when we can. #CharliesAngels
@RUSTYROOFTOP @FarrahFawcettFN You read it perfectly! I was thrilled 💕 #CharliesAngels
@Donna07914609 I love so many! Always a fan of the clip episodes that took you through  highlights from the season. One that really stands out is "Angels in  Chains." We were actually chained together so it was a day full of  jokes, laughter and smiles. #CharliesAngels
@EmmaJan07708706 and... I hope you have a Happy Valentine's Day too!
@EmmaJan07708706 WOW! Thank you! Is it OK that I've loved all of them?
@totosendra @drinaldioficial It would change based on the episode, based on what we needed to shoot.
@Marcelo03 I don't know the exact number...but A LOT ;)
@MABrownStuff I love all the seasons and the changing fashions that go with them.

@DesireeRogers88 So far so good! How about you?
@mybelle0118 I am always looking for the next great script that lines up with my schedule. It is always a possibility and keep checking in with my on social for updates.
@alsamryka My favorite color is green, all shades of it. In terms of fabric I can't limit it to just one. I like it to please me visually and I like it to feel good.
@rjc1960_richard My designs are still being sold online and in-store @kmart. We are already designing for the next season and we are all working together to be a better stronger store.
@SarcasticWonder Now that I am watching things with my granddaughter Bea I think it would be so much fun to do voice-over work for an animated movie.
@bec_zales The people. Their warmth and approachability. So down to earth.
@slayforyou @DrewBarrymore ran into me in Beverly Hills and she asked me to do it and I had so much fun doing it. They really made me feel welcome...and I remember the food was incredible. There was everything you could imagine, it was a great day! #CharliesAngels
@Sincitynv13 Yes I do and I will be there at a speaking engagement in May! It's a short flight and I love coming to see the shows.
@drinaldioficial I'm not sure when I am going to finish, but it will be a biography. It is taking me longer than expected because it's an emotional process. You have to dig deep, but I am still working on it.
@krhugs Honored. Honored! We have worked together several times and he never disappointed. He is also a very close friend of mine.
@RMS_78 I don't think so, but I don't know for certain #CharliesAngels
@orfan4life I loved all my roles, Rage of Angels was great because I was a knew mother and it was a great time for me. Everything fell into place and my favorite role was Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy.
@iamjosephduffy It was such a different part and movie. I didn't think of #CharliesAngels during the shooting, but it absolutely came up after the fact during press for the movie. He had a nickname for me, it was Snow White ;)
@mallhopper It would be a stand in ;) #CharliesAngels
@GlennDodd5 Wonderful! How are you?
@ChiaraLove39 I am so happy for you that it's behind you. I'm proud of you for getting through the treatment. Onward and upward. I'm doing great today and I hope you are too!
@claudia_mutti I love the time right before the sun goes down. I find it beautiful.
@FalconEric012 He was the sweetest, funniest, kindest....You know he was the balancing act between all the girls. He really held us all together through the sometimes stressful 18 hour work days. He loved his candy bars, no one was ever gonna go into his trailer &amp; take his precious candy mars.
@chris_omeara I did not see it can you try to send again?
@maplemouth Do I have to pick one? I love peach cobbler, lemon meringue...and brownies are good!
@kbrow14 My dream vacation for my family is that when Bea is older we are going to do a African Safari. Have never been and it would be incredible to share that with my family.
@navarrete_jesse I had the pleasure of working with him twice. We also did George Washington together, where I got to see the depth of his talent. Not only is he a talented actor, which I knew from #CharliesAngels, but he is also an incredible director!
@EmmaJan07708706 I love comedy! I think the best medicine is laughter. It was challenging for me to do it because I hadn't done it before. There is a spontaneity to it and it is such a departure from the more dramatic roles I've done. I would love to do more...and thank you, I just love my girls.
@charlesbud78 @liquidmassage @YandR_CBS @kristoffstjohn1 It's very sad. Sending love to his family and loved ones.
@liquidmassage @YandR_CBS @kristoffstjohn1 I didn't know him personally, but it is sad and I think when you are a fan of someone...especially for a longer period of time that you do feel a connection to them. Wishing you well Wade 💜
@BrianSLSpringer I have recorded in the past for musicals, but would love to do voice-over work. It could be a lot of fun!
@Jeffery0301 I still get to do everything I enjoy, but one major thing that has changed would be that I can't just blend in with the crowd ;) This can change little things like running to the store into a larger ordeal because there's more to think about.

@DesireeRogers88 telling stories &lt;3
@MesaAZ424 thank you and you are welcome!
@orfan4life uh oh!
@JoeEnglish16 hahahaha! Never ;)
@georgehogan1 No I can't say that I did.
@MesaAZ424 That was me. It took all day long to do that burn makeup and I had to do it more than one day.
@chidrool He was a generous man, he knew everyone's name in the crew. I had grown up knowing him so it was great to work with him. It was a pleasure working with him.
@orfan4life It was one of the more memorable moments because I took it on fully and I think it really threw Farrah. It was one of the first scenes where you don't see an angel you see a crazy person.
@DesireeRogers88 The most precious time is spent with family and most certainly Bea.
@Marcelo03 It was just the way I wanted to wear my hair. I don't have a stylist who created it.
@MarianApgar Pat Conroy is my favorite author, especially Beach Music!
@thekeysmusic Thank you :)
@jobean_1964 I loved the book and went back and read it again to help with the character. I did that with Rage of Angels too, which was my favorite.
@12truewest I will absolutely be watching. We love having homemade chili while we watch it with a lot of yummy desserts.
@PhilEx I have been asked to and I have made several trips. I filmed over there quite a lot and I am sure I will be back again.
@DesireeRogers88 There are too many to limit it to just one. I was blessed with an incredible childhood and I owe it all to my parents.
@phoenix_elvis I love to clean!
@Jody42793627 I loved shooting in Hawaii and we did that twice. I always loved shooting the office scenes as well.
@loriloriCM The Caribbean is my favorite, I love Mexico too and Hawaii.
@lettydelacruz21 Hello!
@gtess123 Maybe one of the trains would fair better if they went south.

@Lundy1970 I love baseball. When my son was in football, hockey, soccer and baseball I was always there on the front line. There's nothing quite like watching your children excel at something they love! I loved cheering him on and would have cheered him even if he wasn't wonderful ;)
@MarkGarrison1 Absolutely ;)
@raul7879 I always felt it was about the three girls and their relationship, not one lead and two supporting. #CharliesAngels
@MCDaisySF Her name is Bea, short for Beatrice. She was two on September 17th and there is no one I would rather spend time with. She is pure light, joy and everything good. She takes me back to the magic of childhood and I now know why they call these the "golden years."
@diaImformegan That I'm still here 40+ years later. I'm still doing it and I'm still showing up! I am blessed with people who continue to watch, follow and support me.
@zainfan1 I felt and still feel truly blessed. #CharliesAngels
@JosephHecht20 It's also what I miss most, seeing the girls every day and their friendship. #CharliesAngels
@DesireeRogers88 The girls...the day to day comradery, the friendships and crossing that bridge together. #CharliesAngels
@rjc1960_richard I'm always striving not to, but I may have broken one or two...
@PVD2SFO Thank you!
@Sincitynv13 I'm doing great! How are you?
@Lizzseven7 I'm feeling great! Hi from Los Angeles, how are you doing?
@hmcsr I know I answered you already, but if you need more info it was a 1976 Ford Mustang II Ghia...what a gift!
@HillPlaceBlog I would have to say John Llewellyn Moxey, he directed the pilot and that truly set the tone for what the show would become. #CharliesAngels
@gingersnap599 I have tons of family in Texas and it will always be home.
@MetalFanInBlack Well I do like @nbcsvu!
@LauschJack Thank you!
@hijproductions There are so many talented directors, but I would love to work with @BillyCrystal.
@Braddtastic I was in Brownie and Girl Scouts, but never 4-H...and boy was I so proud of my first Brownie outfit. I loved it!
@rayg2068 Yes, not lately and I have listened to them all. She used to sing on set all the time. She would burst out into song all the time, she has a beautiful voice!
@chris_omeara I'm not sure, where would I know her from?
@ejenana3 @mamax3xo @Kmart It should redirect to: https://t.co/QlMUwaCMDz
@mamax3xo @Kmart @ejenana3 Strange! It should redirect to: https://t.co/QlMUwaCMDz
@TheRetroPixie If we were playing a character that required it, like a showgirl etc. but in general what we were very natural without fake hair or lashes.

@BornLstn2Cher I love that!
@hmcsr 1976 Ford Mustang II ;)
Going through all the questions I missed last week when I wasn't feeling well ;) #AskJaclyn
@RUSTYROOFTOP @FarrahFawcettFN I can't pick just one as a favorite, but one of the best memories was when we shot Angels in Chains...we were all actually chained together, it was a long work day but we had so many laughs and such an incredible time. I will never forget it. #CharliesAngels
@Jeffery0301 In terms of creating I always wanted to get into choreography since I have always been passionate about dance, but life got so busy and I never had the chance to.
@JChergi I never had the pleasure to meet him, but would have loved to and I think Nancy Drew could be fun if the script is right.
@imjustabill02 I have enjoyed showing up for everything I've done. The Bourne Identity was one of the most physically challenging that I've done, but I loved it!

@BerzyPeter thank you, you too!
@JerZeeJess you are so welcome.
@FalconEric012 I get as much information as I can from the script, then I fill in the rest about my character by developing her myself.
@debbyshanahan it’s a special time that I will always cherish ❤️
@AmandaFan48 thank you! I’m glad to hear it, we all keep in touch. Life, schedules and distance can get in the way, but we talk when we can.

@MelissaTT2000 They are candied ;)
@AngelJ5 @RealCherylLadd It's always out there! We have both been busy and going in different directions, I'm in LA and she's in Texas. Regardless I would love to work with her again and I hope to soon.
@panda41168 Conditioning is the most important, but I think it all starts with a great hairstylist, who can help you understand your hair type and also help you find the right products to keep it healthy.
@BrianSLSpringer She directed a commercial for me that I was in for @Kmart  with Bob Hope and I was with in Battle of the Network Stars with her. She ran before me and she was FAST! She gave the baton and I was so fast I got the nickname Jackie the Jet. She also directed me years later.
@NZGrant4angels She directed a commercial for me that I was in for @Kmart with Bob Hope and I was with in Battle of the Network Stars with her.  She ran before me and she was FAST! She gave the baton and I was so fast  I got the nickname Jackie the Jet. She also directed me years later...
@Dorian47759011 I would say loyalty, because it is something that is very important to me. When I love someone I'm 100% in.
@Marcelo03 I was in awe of working with him, he could do it all. I admired his work, especially Some Like It Hot. He was a giving actor and I learned so much from the experience. We ended up being very good friends.
@IsobelAura She directed a commercial for me that I was in for @Kmart with Bob Hope and I was with in Battle of the Network Stars with her. She ran before me and she was FAST! She gave the baton and I was so fast I got the nickname Jackie the Jet. She also directed me years later.
@HayleyHodge8 When we shot Angels in Chains. It was a long work day, but filled with so much joy and laughter!
@bec_zales My favorite was a new purse as a young girl &lt;3
@BetteDavis2009 I do Pilates and I absolutely love it!
@gingersnap599 @jjsmom2008 No but I get a lot of compliments on it so I have considered making one.
@JustinE58574742 Yes indeed ;)
@SandyH1111 Hands down spending time with the people who I love the most, my family.
@Hillaryfan4Ever @hallmarkchannel Merry Christmas!!

@Sincitynv13 You are so welcome!
@jjsmom2008 I actually blend my own, but I like Light Blue. It's a very crisp, fresh scent!
Kristen I love it!!! You look fabulous. cc @Kmart https://t.co/C3zALp8eKn
@Sincitynv13 I'm doing well! How are you?
@MetalFanInBlack My favorites are Silent Night, Oh Come All Ye Faithful, Joy To The  World...I love the fun ones too like I Saw Mom Kissing Santa Claus! I really love all the classics.
@loriloriCM Well, one of my favorite Christmas movies is It's a Wonderful Life &lt;3
@DrCristianLeite The best way to request one is by emailing contact@jaclynsmith.com.
@AdamMichaelHay4 Good morning! I sure am, are you?

@KristenMtJoy @Kmart Oh I have so many!! I will be posting one a day for the next couple weeks...want me to send a few over to you.
@gingersnap599 @Lindsayfan Beautifully put 💗
@RMS_78 She was the best 💗
@MelissaTT2000 You're so welcome! I can't wait to hear what you think.
@SLBG50 It's all individual to the person, ideally something unexpected. I think it should be fun and be a variety of things. Could be anything from a diamond ring to a piece of chocolate to a pair of sunglasses to a small stuffed animal.
@BBKGLFAN Christmas balls are always beautiful in a glass bowl, a hurricane with a candle surrounded by Christmas balls or a wreath, a holiday floral arrangement is always nice too.
@Stan_Stinson This is great! Thank you for sharing Stan!!
@Lindsayfan It wasn't easy for me. This is a part of life that we all struggle with. As hard as it is she is still a part of everything and will be present with you whether it's from a memory, or a gift or a photo. Thank you for writing me, it's beautiful to see a man embrace his feelings.
@MelissaTT2000 My mother, through the choices she made and the example she set. She lived a life free of regret and got to live to see her great-grandchildren.
@TuckerPeterson_ Happy Birthday!!
@LauschJack Both sounds magical as long as family is there.
@JosephHecht20 I love sweet potatoes with marshmallows and dressing (both are my mom's recipe)...I also love my mom's Christmas Fruit Cookies! You can get cookie recipe here: https://t.co/vPpDwrj3cd
@BobLiggett I love gifts. The act of giving is something beautiful to me. If you want to get her a gift I would say do it! I will be posting some of my favorite gift ideas from my line over the next two weeks. Let me know if you want me to send you some links.
@lugosiwashere The whole month before Christmas we start wearing our Christmas Pajamas and I love the decorating leading up to it. Now with Bea it's so much fun to watch her discover it all for the first time.
@BDiGenova My first thought is to spend more time...that's always the best gift. If they live in Los Angeles I would suggest Love Actually...it's a fabulous holiday performance. I also have several fabulous gifts from my line for less than $20. Let me know if you want me to send links ;)
@phoenix_elvis Happy Birthday!!
@RUSTYROOFTOP thank you!
@RMS_78 There was another time when I was out with my mom shopping and we saw a ring that I loved. I didn't get it, right away and when I got back to get it...it was gone! Little did I know that she had got it for me. It was a beautiful surprise and I still wear it all the time.
@RMS_78 This is a tough one! Although, when my kids were smaller (7 and 4) they gave me a video with shots of our lives and them telling me how much they care about me. It is something I still cherish to this day.
@melaniemorettis Sometimes it can be warmer for Christmas here in Los Angeles, but I love spending Christmas some place cold, with snow and a fireplace.
@BerzyPeter I'm wonderful! How are you?
@CindyKennedy6 Thank you Cindy and happy holidays!
Merry Christmas Del! https://t.co/gaKPFyB9LY
@bikinimowing I love my mom's Christmas Fruit Cookies! They are perfect for the holidays. Here's the recipe: https://t.co/vPpDwrj3cd

I will be online this morning at 10am PT (1pm ET) to chat about easy and affordable gift ideas! Tweet me your questions with #AskJaclyn 😉
Thank you for taking the time to chat with me. I will be back at the same day/time next week: WEDS 12/12 @ 10am PT (1pm ET). I will start with any of the questions that I missed &amp; then take new ones. You can start sending questions now, but please make sure to include #AskJaclyn!
@KendraBCambra It's my family, they are my favorite and the best gift because it's spending time with them that makes the holidays magical. It's that feeling of home that simply wouldn't exist if they weren't there to share it with me.
@Breatheonme2 @Steph78480 Hi @Steph78480 -- Hope you have a happy holiday!
@Donna07914609 They are my mom's fruitcake Christmas cookies...they are so delicious! I will be posting the recipe soon so keep a look out.
@dugsr1 I loved doing that movie and I love that I now get to share it with my granddaughter. Such a wonderful cast and it really has holiday magic in it.
@claudia_mutti I LOVE CHRISTMAS &lt;3
@FalconEric012 I hope you have a fabulous holiday as well!
@KayCo51 @RealCherylLadd I am on for usually about an hour when I do these. I am just wrapping up one right now. If I don't get to all the questions today I will start with whatever questions are left the next time I check in. To ask me a question, simply Tweet me with #AskJaclyn ;)
@rayraynic1 I used to love last minute shopping, but now I like to get it done early. So now if I don't get it done early it really stresses me out.
@ChiaraLove39 In 2002 I was diagnosed with breast cancer and I had a lumpectomy and radiation to treat it. The more time that goes by the easier it is to live with, but I understand what you're saying. My husband still goes with me for every mammogram, which absolutely helps calms my nerves.
@WhitfieldPaul Not at the moment, but I will definitely pass word along that there's interest. In terms of singing I used to sing in musical theater and I loved it. However I had to have a polyp removed and since then I don't sing as much.
@MetalFanInBlack Silent Night is my favorite because it reminds me of my mom, but I love so many of them...Winter Wonderland, I play them year round...lol!
@PerfectTPuglet I sure am, the holidays are always at my house.
@let876 It's normal to have a little tension when you have 3 actresses with 3 different points of view. However, we always respected each other and worked it out. #CharliesAngels
@bravofanlisa I just love It's a Wonderful Life!
@RobTakamoto We all get together the night before Christmas and everyone gets to open one gift. Then we go out for dinner and spend the entire next day at home with family opening gifts and eating good food. I just love it!
@nicoleb21x I love my mother's fruitcake Christmas cookies...which I will be posting soon. It's perfect with hot cider, which is another treat that really embodies the holidays for me.
@BerzyPeter Thank you so much!
@jag_mel I think it could be fun to get her a stylish purse from my line @Kmart/@Sears...in fact growing up one of my favorite gifts was a purse on Christmas.
@Breatheonme2 Currently one of my favorites is @ThisIsUsWriters &lt;3
@BC406 I hope you have a terrific day too ;)
@WCTVNJ Just send me your questions with #AskJaclyn in your Tweets. If I don't get to it in this chat I will answer it in the next one ;)
@MarianApgar The most recent book I read was Female Persuasion. I would recommend Gold Finch, American Wife and I like all Pat Conroy's books, he even has a cook book!
@drinaldioficial @Kmart No plans for one right now, but I will definitely post all my upcoming appearances here on social to give you a heads up.
@EmmaJan07708706 Oh yes! I am going to get some pictures uploaded to share with all of you and thank you for the compliment I do get a lot of questions about decorating ;)
@Lundy1970 I love A Wonderful Life and we absolutely watch it. I really love classics, movies that have the nostalgia and that magic to them.
@EmmaJan07708706 My favorite are these delicious fruitcake Christmas cookies that my mom used to make. We can't keep enough of them around. Everyone eats them...LOL! Should I share the recipe?
@gingersnap599 Opening up one present the night before Christmas to get excited about the rest of the gifts on Christmas day.
@immrstea Christmas Eve is the family gets together and everyone opens one present and Christmas Day we all wear pajamas (even the guys) and open the gifts and spend the day eating and enjoying each other's company. I love it!
@campbellm65 There are quite a few, but one that I have always loved is getting together with the family on Christmas Eve and we all open one present to get excited for the rest of them the next day. We also go out for a family dinner and then on Christmas spend the whole day together.
@Zebbie67 I love spending time with my family, especially my sweet little granddaughter Bea!

@BrianSLSpringer I love @ThisIsUsWriters and would really enjoy being a part of it.
@Pookiemc526 If you are talking about #CharliesAngels my favorite is Angels in Chains. It was just so much fun to shoot it, there was a lot of laughter. I also loved the re-caps where highlights from the season were shown.
@ShaggyJake1 I do love shopping in person, but sometimes it's just so convenient to shop online.
@DrHubbert @Lundy1970 I'm well! I hope you are too.
@bravofanlisa You are so welcome!
@Donna07914609 Well it's going to be hard. I am going to be making my mother's Christmas cookies. I ignore working out because there is so much else to do. Everything in moderation, and the holidays should be about treating yourself. Don't you think?
@bravofanlisa I keep in touch with Cheryl and Kate, distance and schedules can make it hard to see each other, but we have always stayed in touch.
@nelli_molinari It can be layered. What I always say is anything can work if it pleases you.
@Johnwesley2112 Really for me it's wherever my family is...so wherever home is.
@12truewest @hallmarkchannel I have! I love @hallmarkchannel and that could be really special.
@Lundy1970 There's one that really stands out. I wanted this doll, it was called the big doll. I was a small child and this doll was as big as me. There was so much magic in that moment, the feeling that Santa had brought that for me is so special. My parents really were a gift to me.
@jusegu No but I have had to learn some for roles in the past.
@KChervy It was kind of magical making this movie. We shot a lot on green screen which is a challenge, but the actors were wonderful. When we did shoot on sets they were incredible. I'm so glad to hear you enjoy it!
@FalconEric012 He had such a passion for his work, he was so engaged. He committed to the role, knew the script and was constantly giving feedback to ensure that his work was the best it could be.
@LeesaSawyer_13 If it was a show today, I would love to be a part of @ThisIsUsWriters. Such an incredible and emotional show. I love it!
@drinaldioficial We have a big Christmas party on Christmas Day with friends and family. With usually around 20-25 people, but this year it may be a little smaller, around 10 people. We try to keep it intimate tho, so that everyone has a chance to connect and talk.
@EmmaJan07708706 Absolutely! They even have their own stockings, and they are well taken care of.
@katiebugjackson I have a collection that goes back (I don't want to say how far back...LOL). Most are sentimental, things my children or my mother made...We also add new ones every year. You could say it's a tradition.
@gingersnap599 Our main tree is a real tree and themed trees from my line, all of which are faux ;)
@Rolyma My line is designed for everyone. For tops we go up to 3X and up to a size 26 in bottoms. We also have bedding, we did bathroom items in the past but we aren't currently offering them. You can shop my line here: https://t.co/uTeLvpKKes
@ChiaraLove39 There isn't one planned, but I always say never say never. It could be a lot of fun!
@chocolotto12 Opening up one present the night before Christmas with my family.
@LeesaSawyer_13 Currently we are only selling in the US and Puerto Rico, but stay tuned for updates!
@LeesaSawyer_13 I have always loved fashion and my mother wanted to be a fashion designer. She would design dresses for herself and for me. @Kmart reached out to me and gave me the opportunity to have complete control of the designs and it was a perfect fit.
@LoverMartini I never want to say never, but I am actually a private person and not sure I would enjoy it. However, I was on Sheer Genius and I am more geared to reality shows that are competition based. I love Project Runway, so something along those lines could be fun.
@loriloriCM We open one present Christmas Eve and a tree trimming day that goes into  the evening because we have so many ornaments ;) I love carrying on traditions from my parents with my children.
Loving chatting with all of you about the holidays! #AskJaclyn
@rayraynic1 Hi Del! My favorite are Silent Night, Oh Come All Ye Faithful, Joy To The World...I love the fun ones too like I Saw Mom Kissing Santa Claus! I love all the classics.
@RMS_78 It was wonderful! I love spending time with my family! How was yours?
@HayleyHodge8 I love spending time with my family, especially my sweet granddaughter Bea 💗

My sweaters are going on #SALE for $12 @Kmart (in store + online)!! SALE starts at 6am on #Thanksgiving morning! https://t.co/zqB2SwgaY2 https://t.co/JaU0jQQrJJ
This was my first big break! Do you remember these ads? #FBF https://t.co/vXvRr2qeXO https://t.co/qzU53jG6NN
Thank you all for a wonderful chat! I will post date/time info for the next one soon.
@Purplelady35 Just my little Bea, the light of our lives!
@DPBirdieman I have already played her, Kelly Garrett ;) #charliesangels
@Stan_Stinson Happy Thanksgiving!!
@KarenLNHollis @woodg31 Having my children, bringing them into the world. Being on a show that can still be talked about 40 years later, it's something I am so proud to have been a part of. #charliesangels
@tottee35 My mother remains my inspiration and my children and granddaughter inspire me every day...the future! My mother is the past, but still very much a part of the present.
@enriqueskincare Our home has not but the devastating loss of people losing their home...it's beyond comprehension. If you haven't seen this article yet here are ways that everyone can help: https://t.co/gfTdRBy3Be
@Johnwesley2112 Christmas Eve is always big in matching pajamas, we are all in them. Even the guys! We open one present and go out that night and then have a big family Christmas lunch on Christmas Day.
@rinfiniti1 Thank you
@BDiGenova @RealCherylLadd Cheryl and I see each other when we can, she lives in Texas, but she sent me yellow roses on my birthday. I also stay in touch with Kate and we talk when we can. I would love to do another Hallmark movie.
@greg_lema I was offered one for Canonball Run I believe, but it didn't work out.
@mccarthy_tom What a master he was of the whole entertainment world. He knew how to put the right pieces together from all ends of the production. He never skimped on anything, it was the best lighting, sets, motorhomes...He could do it all..even act if need be!
@BetteDavis2009 I don't have one yet, one day! For now I have my skincare line: https://t.co/q0tXJF9GOR
@katiebugjackson Thank you
@turnedmirrors Flared pants and pants with a more wide leg. I love shapes, so shoulder pads are another fun trend to play with as well. As designers we evolve, but we go back to what works too.
@Marcelo03 I had an instinct that it was a winning concept. I also knew Kate and I knew Farrah, and I liked the characters. I knew it was a unique concept, three women leading instead of three men. #CharliesAngels
@statenisland65 The best way to request one is by emailing contact@jaclynsmith.com.
@SowingInSilence Developed in California was special to me because I got to create the fragrance myself. We all worked so hard on that and won Favorite Mass Produced Fragrance of that year by the Fragrance Foundation! Thank you for help making it a success!
@tktk2045 Memories like that touch me, thank you for bringing it back to me 💗
@statenisland65 I would love it! Christmas is my favorite time of year. I like going to different times in holiday movies and would love to explore that. I have been offered some from @hallmarkchannel that didn't work with my schedule, but they always do such a great job!
@bikinimowing I love soft colors, greens, dusty colors and taupes. I love when fabrics have depth, shades of colors. You see this a lot in antiques and older fabrics, but I also design this effect into my fabrics with @Fabricut.
@rjc1960_richard I love to celebrate with traditional food, my mother's dressing, sweet potatoes with marshmallows all the good stuff. Brad brings in spaetzle and a carrot pudding from his heritage. I love it because it's family with less pressure. This year we will be celebrating in SB.
@danielskipsey I'll have to take a listen and find out ;)
@JChergi In Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy I had to speak French and Spanish as her language skills were critical to campaigning and managing foreign affairs.
@JChergi Rhythmic gymnastics is exactly where I would be. I was a ballet dancer and am still passionate about ballet.
@WyAttDoRiAn Thank you!
@FredGiancursio Hi Fred 💗
I'm online answering questions right now! Tweet me with #AskJaclyn 💗
I will be online today at 10am PT (1p ET). You can start tweeting me your questions now. Make sure to include #AskJaclyn in your tweets ❤️
Excellent article outlining how you can help the victims of the California wildfires. It lists everything from where to donate food/money, how to help with caring for displaced animals, providing housing through @Airbnb and even where you can volunteer your time. Please share 🙏 https://t.co/YawMlCZ84M
Look what I found on Instagram! Thank you Walter Tab 💙 https://t.co/JEyOoOQVqf https://t.co/Zs2d6igW3w
My heart goes out to the victims, along with their families and friends, of the Thousand Oaks shooting. My prayers are with you.
My favorite troll family! https://t.co/dm8W7pPOEy https://t.co/3aX9rv3NtD
@Zebbie67 Thank you so much Simon! I am having a great day and I hope you are too!!
@ncdye She was a gourmet cook and she had a wonderful wicked sense of humor!
@BobLiggett I like all kinds of movies. I like thrillers, I like love stories...I like fairy tales. Movies are my thing, when they are done well they are really my thing. I like all kinds of restaurants... in Los Angeles I love the Apple Pan and Spago, but there are so many!
@mtweetin @hwinkler4real @MoMcCormick7 💖💖💖
@Zebbie67 I had an incredible birthday. Couldn't have been better, because I was surrounded by family, my favorite people.
@kernowman63 When we are dealing with kids coming to the door on Halloween, I always opt for treats. I am not big on scaring people...lol!
@rayg2068 No I do not, but I wish I did! I didn't even know that, thanks for the info. #CharliesAngels
@MetalFanInBlack I love candy, I do like chocolate kisses and candy corn...I really like caramel apples, not that we get those, but it's something I love!
@KendraBCambra Not to worry! The answer is absolutely, I am constantly looking at new scripts and as soon as I find the next one that's a good fit it will happen.
@Marcelo03 Thank you, that's very kind. Happy Halloween!
@dinahleigh It was definitely Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy. Loved that role!
@wilee12 I add appearances frequently, we don't have anything scheduled now, but I always post upcoming appearances here on social first. So keep checking in and Happy Halloween!
@kozy1965 I love Japan! I don't have plans to come back at the moment, but I will always post my appearances here on social first.
@TriciaTrevino I have my own skincare line that I developed with my husband who keeps it very cutting edge with all the latest anti-aging ingredients. For more information visit: https://t.co/nLiHZUw2Hy
@JoanneT24420043 Playing Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy was definitely one of my favorites.
@aarconv We have Scarlett O'Hara outfits, witch outfits...we have a variety of costumes for our dogs.
@MsGasometer Being loved and loving is the best way to look and feel beautiful.
@BBKGLFAN With my family! We started the day with balloons and my favorite pancakes. I opened presents throughout the day and enjoyed a wonderful dinner with my loved ones at night.
@DrStephenLBerm1 I love to keep up with them. The kids are grown now, I would love to see them all. When I did the movie I looked at it as a gift to my children that they could enjoy every holiday. Scott was so sweet, he gave me  a ring at the end of taping and CJ was also very sweet.
@deecee1964 I admire her, I don't wear a lot of her designs, but her work is incredible so innovative. Some of my favorites are @KarlLagerfeld and @MaisonValentino. I also think @billblass is amazing.
@Daisy099 Mine is Christmas by far. I had a Christmas baby! I love decorating and the magic of the holiday. The longer you can believe in Santa Claus the better.
@loriloriCM Happy Halloween! I love dressing up, but scary movies aren't really for me. So I guess I would have to say I prefer cute...LOL!
@Winniepooh16 Thank you!
@EikangerEvan I'm actually not that into scary movies, but I do love to dress up for Halloween.
@thatgurlluna I think Halloween is a little scary for me, I make sure I'm with other people. Typically I don't watch horror movies, I will do it in a group, but it's not something I usually tune into.
@drinaldioficial We celebrated our birthdays together on set because our birthdays were so close to each other. #CharliesAngels
@charliesangells I was a witch one time and it was a departure for me, with crazy hair...we were freaky witches and it was something I got to do with my daughter.
@GunnKassidy I loved Angels in Chains because it was such a fun episode to shoot ;) #CharliesAngels
@danielskipsey I do love home and my home away from home, Santa Barbara...I also love a Christmas vacation where there's snow and you can get all bundled up by the fire.
@gingersnap599 She's going to be Princess Poppy from the Trolls. My daughter is very creative and imaginative. It's a different direction than I took to dress her growing up, but I love it.
@SamaraRiviera I think it's a winning concept and in time things change and the show is adjusting to fit in a new environment.
@jobean_1964 Definitely check out the line that I developed with my husband. It's what I use on my own skin: https://t.co/q0tXJF9GOR
@BDiGenova Make a plan and find people who you can learn from. I think internships are exceptional tools for achieving this. Be prepared to do the work and make sure you're pursuing something that you're passionate about.
@claudia_mutti I love the magic of The Nutcracker, so I would love a mask from that.
@BerzyPeter Thank you, you too!
@JChergi Yes! We lived next door to each other at one time and we did celebrate together when we were doing #CharliesAngels and even after. I love carving pumpkins, especially with patterns you can really do incredible designs. I think lighting them up is just magic!
@RMS_78 Yes, I am going to be watching my son's house. I am on door duty, but hopefully I will be able to get out and do a little trick or treating with Bea.
@susanm32 Certainly one with my children, it would be the first Halloween where they knew what they were doing. they both loved dressing up and ended up with some pretty ornate costumes.
I'm online now! Let's chat!! Tweet me your questions with #AskJaclyn 💖
Happy Halloween!! My next chat starts at 10am PT (1pm ET). Please Tweet me your questions now &amp; make sure to include #AskJaclyn. Talk soon 😉
@DishNation 💕
@kathyireland Thank you 💕
@Kmart Thank you!!
@Sears Thank you 💕
What are your plans for #Halloween? Join me for my next chat tomorrow morning at 10am PT (1pm ET)! Make sure to Tweet me your questions with #AskJaclyn. Hope to see you there 👻
Thank you all for the sweet birthday messages last week! I'm definitely feeling the love 💗
Thank you @InStyle! I love my @Kmart/Sears family 💖 https://t.co/cqGApzRIqd
I woke up to this. It’s so great to feel loved! https://t.co/HmA7WUagWh https://t.co/9HKmIGBiAY
@MelissaSommer3 My mother was at heart a designer. She designed clothes for her and me. When @kmart first approached me she was my first thought. I saw a space that needed to be filled, fashion at an affordable price. I still love it today!
@EikangerEvan First do I want to keep turning the page, am I rooting for the characters and is it an interesting story -- is there someone to pull for? If it gets me excited then it's heading in the right direction.
@codycattle54 Yes, we are working hard. Still designing and producing new pieces. #iHeartSears
@denisecahoon4 I sing Broadway tunes to myself, I started my career with musicals. The best are from shows I've done like Westside Story and The Sound of Music. I just LOVE musicals! Don't you?
@Johnwesley2112 I do love a hamburger.
@drinaldioficial The Female Persuasion Meg Wolitzer, it's a beautifully written book that I am still working on. Definitely worth the read so far!
@EmmaJan07708706 She's going to a troll and we LOVE to trick or treat! I have some great pics I will be posting.
@RMS_78 He asked me to do a movie, and we talked on the phone. I couldn't do it because of other commitments. He sent me a giant Hershey Kiss to let me know he understood a commitment is a commitment.
@thatgurlluna Well I just got a text from Kate today. She sent a picture of us...times change, but friendship stays.
@Daisy099 My children and still working at my age ;)
@gingersnap599 Thank you! We are going to have a family dinner with our beautiful Bea, just hang out and enjoy each other. Dinner out and birthday cake back at home. We go big on themed cakes so I am looking forward to it!
@alicehyatt House of Wax (the original) and Copycat both really scared me!
@FalconEric012 To go from one season to the next with such different, talented and beautiful women really made it fun and interesting because you didn't know what to expect. They were both surprising and unique in their own way.m #CharliesAngels
@hsfolk Make sure you have passion for it and surround yourself by people who know the space. It can often be smart to intern for someone you respect in the space to learn from them.
@BobLiggett For the most part yes, although I do believe in moderation. I usually start with healthy smoothie with fruit and greens in it followed by organic proteins and vegetables.
@KarbonikAnne Thank you!!
@SONNYBOGGS Thank you!
@SPACEnterprise Thank you &lt;3
@Lizzseven7 I would love to! Keep checking in with me here on social for updates.
@lmk66 I stay active...love Pilates! I eat healthy (most of the time) and take great care of my skin. You can learn more about my line by visiting: https://t.co/q0tXJF9GOR
@mptennis102 Always reviewing scripts looking for my next role, but I'm currently in the early stages of writing my book.
@Marcelo03 Thank you that's very sweet! I love it!
@drinaldioficial I do! I was able to keep a few pieces, but I wish I had kept more. #CharliesAngels
Good morning! Looking forward to chatting with all of you today. Don't forget to include #AskJaclyn in your tweet. I am online responding now ;)
There's still time to send me your questions before our chat starts at 10am (1pm ET). Make sure to include #AskJaclyn in your tweets. Chat soon 💗
Please tweet me your questions with #AshJaclyn. I will be online answering them from 10-11am PT (1-2pm ET) tomorrow! Looking forward to chatting with you all 💗
Did you know that @fabricut just launched their new furniture collection, which I had the pleasure of designing this beautiful room around? https://t.co/k94k410k1N
I am so grateful for the positive response to my latest fabric &amp; wallcovering collections for @trendfabrics. It was truly a labor of love!
This fabulous Go Glamorous wig from my collection with @joseeberhair and @PaulaYoungWigs is on SALE! Not only is it gorgeous, with long wavy layers, but it's made from heat-styleable fibers! https://t.co/rJnCYH5VkW
@Coltfan12 I love that the show still resonates with people today 💗
@tatantatan Happy birthday! I do these whenever I can, keep a lookout as I will be posting my next chat time soon. I appreciate the support! I can't say that I have a favorite because I have loved them all. Is there one that stands out for you?
@rinfiniti1 I believe in moderation, but I do love a good hamburger!
@jobean_1964 So do I ;)
@CharliesAngelsR I am a huge fan of @TheCrownNetflix!
@paulyoungcpa Not this time ;)
@CoachKristinH @kathyireland Thank you!
@1969suzie @kathyireland Thank you!
@jakubinaz1 Shelley was an interesting choice our ratings were strong enough to carry us to a fifth season #CharliesAngels
@ChiaraLove39 Never! Which made it even more fascinating for me...it made the acting more fun because of the mystery of it all ;) #CharliesAngels
@IamReneeLynne Absolutely not! It's never too late for anything. If you have a passion for something age shouldn't hold you back. Nothing should!
@jobean_1964 I start by asking questions about the character's history. If those aren't in the script I create that myself. My character always has a history it's what defines her...where is she from? what is her favorite color? Does she have any siblings..There a million questions to answer.
@claudia_mutti I think all the office scenes were fun to do...I loved them! We were on our home stage, it was like being at home...and we would talk about new scripts. Great memories. #CharliesAngels
@SharonA25254459 Absolutely! If you are in an area where you can't shop in store, you can always buy my clothes online https://t.co/uTeLvpKKes and https://t.co/fOhOtA7NN9 💗
@SharonA25254459 I would LOVE to do it! I have been to perfume factories in France and I actually blend my own perfume and I get a lot of compliments on it. So it's something I am considering.
@wennpa I honored my contract and loved Aaron Spelling. It was a great show #CharliesAngels
@RMS_78 I missed the game but I am a @Dodgers fan and I am so glad they won!!!
@JChergi It's so ironic you bring up Donnie &amp; Marie because being a part of their show was a highlight for me! It was a real departure for me because it brought me back to dance and to my past. I loved it!
@JChergi My favorite costume is my granddaughter dressed as an Oompa Loompa...I am going to find a photo of it and post it.
@SophieCoberly Good afternoon Sophie! We were so blessed on the show to have so much great talent. There were so many fabulous actors and actresses! Too many to list here ;)
@TwinSis002 I would start with surrounding yourself with people who can help you can help educate you in the field. Also remember that confidence is key! 50 is young!! Plus it's never too late to pursue your dreams.
@Marcelo03 They supported me on everything. I had a great relationship with them and they were on my side without conditions. I think my value wasn't about career, but more about who I was as a person. They were very supportive 💗
@d60art Hi David and thank you for the Tweet!

Thank you all again for a great chat today! #AskJaclyn
@timwfortenberry I didn’t keep the doll but I have some cool memorabilia and clothes from the show #CharliesAngels
@timwfortenberry did I use my southern voice 😉
@mtweetin @MeTV He was magic. He was the one who could make us all laugh and he couldn't have been a better actor. I adored him!
@EikangerEvan ...I am sure there were things here and there I wanted to change...glad I didn't!
@EikangerEvan Being that we are talking about it 40 years later I wouldn't change a thing, but...
@ct0707 ..Ida Lupino, Kim Basinger, Louis Jourdan, Timothy Dalton..who I also worked w/on Florence Nightingale. There were too many to list.
@ct0707 I did have input into my character and I loved guiding her development. There were so many incredible actors...
Thank you all for a great chat! I will be answering a few more questions and will be posting the info for the next chat soon!!
@JaimePalma yes it does 😉
@nelli_molinari Absolutely! Fashion always comes back around and I think you can see hair styles and trends today that were inspired by the show.
@candymarietayl1 He's even more adorable. He's the whole package, a wonderful human being...funny and talented! He was also a close friend.
@Daisy099 I’m really loving @TheCrownNetflix! I love the story, the actors...the wardrobe. It’s fabulous! I can’t wait for next season.
@d60art yes, I have some clothes, but I wish I had more. My daughter loves vintage pieces and would have loved to see her style more of it.
@cazgirn I don’t think I would change anything because I’m happy with where I am now and I wouldn’t want to risk changing that.
@kallimgmt I’m fortunate to still have them in my life as close friends.
@romack_e a nice marinara sauce, and hi
@lea_robbie @Outlander_STARZ I haven’t but I’m always looking for new shows.
@BobLiggett I love spending time with my granddaughter...going antiquing. I’m also a big fan of Pilates.
@philriding160 we got to do some of it but our safety was always a top concern so we never did anything dangerous.
@KenCostlow not often enough, but it will always be home
@danielskipsey I’m very lucky to have gotten to play so many roles that I have loved
@wvpirate I loved it!
@lauraanne0608 thank you
@enriqueskincare that’s a good question! I’m not really sure 🤭
@LeesaSawyer_13 I’m always excited to see that people still relate to the format &amp; I think if a reboot is done well it can be a lot of fun 😉
@HailLuty @claudia_mutti I love Angels in Chains because it was a fun day and I loved the episodes that showed highlights f/the whole season
@kernowman63 that would be fun! I will post any updates for appearances here on social 💖
@BerzyPeter I’m wonderful! How are you?
@PerfectTPuglet we got to do some of it. However, they wouldn’t let us do anything that was at a certain speed and dangerous #CharliesAngels
@lauraanne0608 I have several, but I loved watching Ida Lupino when I was growing up.
@Sandra12326427 thank you
@Chanelhousewife they don’t have to be ;)
@loriloriCM we were all very close and we each bonded over different things 💖
@ImNamedJames thank you 😉
@LeesaSawyer_13 Angels in Chains...we were actually chained together. There was so much laughter...we had a lot of fun! #CharliesAngels
@KarbonikAnne not that I’ve heard of but I’m open to it.
@plcjoanne that could be fun!
Good morning! I’m online now. Send me your questions with #AskJaclyn 💖
My chat starts in less than an hour at 10am PT (1pm ET). We are talking #CharliesAngels, but you can ask about other topics #AskJaclyn 😉
My next chat is Wednesday 7/26 @ 10am PT (1pm ET). We’ll be talking #CharliesAngels! Tweet me your questions with #AskJaclyn 💖 See you then!
My friend Clarine creates these beautiful bags by hand! Each one is unique and special. Check out her site and let me know what you think: https://t.co/FIpjoAFI3k https://t.co/oELqRM4LTp
How fabulous are this blouse &amp; these booties together? They are both from my collection, which is available exclusively @Sears + @Kmart. PS - the blouse is on SALE for only $20?? You can shop them both here: Blouse: https://t.co/9bZRbe8y4i Booties: https://t.co/JMvl06w0W2 https://t.co/hLjHPnz69z
Hope you have a wonderful weekend! Here’s a quick #FBF to me snuggling another sweet puppy during a photo shoot. https://t.co/neZgi80CLk https://t.co/GJ4L3V3qC8
Taking a break from shooting with @Kmart/@Sears to get some of Elizabeth's sweet kisses 😘 https://t.co/wlBfh8u03o
Thank you all for another great chat! I will be back next week for another on Thursday 9/20 at 10am PT (1pm ET). What should we chat about next? #AskJaclyn
@KarbonikAnne Thank you.
@DavieRiffraff60 Good morning!
@let876 I loved our wardrobe on #CharliesAngels. It's incredible how everything comes back around...look at fashion today. I think we had a classic look on the show.
@rjc1960_richard Yes I did watch it. I think @HarveyLevinTMZ is amazing because he does his homework and asked me questions that I am not usually asked. We had a great time together. #OBJECTified
@ejacobson20 Thank you!
@gingersnap599 I wish I loved fish, but I do eat it often. My favorite is red meat...I am a Texas girl after all, but I eat it in moderation. I eat chicken too. All my meat needs to be organic though, without any hormones.
@little_yootha Yes! We are in touch and I would love to work with her again. She's an excellent actress and a great friend. #CharliesAngels
@flutterbyJC I stay active, love pilates, eat healthy (most of the time), take great care of my skin and surround myself with people that I love.
@scottwrynn That's so cute. I like the way you think. Don't change ;)
@SouthsideNinja1 It's not my favorite, but I do love @coldplay...classical music! I also love @thebeatles @eltonofficial ;)
@tilikum777 I would love to see a project where all three of us are featured to tie the past to the present. #CharliesAngels
@3CupNannie I do eat healthy and keep everything in moderation. I exercise, I do Pilates and stay very active. Between work and family I am always on the go.
@loriloriCM That is so sweet of you! For any inquiries please email contact@jaclynsmith.com.
@timwfortenberry I got to keep all the wardrobe from The Users and John was incredible, such a professional. The movie was full of so many iconic actors. It was an incredible project.
@phildo1965 If you aren't a fan of vegetables try them raw with a dressing, roasted in the oven with olive oil or on the grill with a little salt and pepper...and if all those are out you could always start your day with a green drink like I do ;)
@chocolotto12 I'm a funny person, it depends on what kind of day I'm having. I think food can help us feel better or make us worse. For instance, when I'm stressed I find that too much seasoning makes me feel worse and when I'm feeling good I want to eat it all.
@familyhopefund I love going on walks, and I am drinking some water right now. It's not my favorite thing to do, but I do it because it keeps me healthy.
@wvpirate I would love to choreograph a ballet or produce a Broadway show. If I could find a piece that I REALLY loved, where I could have creative control it could be fun to produce a film/TV project.
@philriding160 I am not sure, they are showing it again here. Hopefully it will come soon, I know you can stream episodes on YouTube...I will let you know if I hear anything.
@tatantatan I love carbs...pasta and bread. So I understand. I have found that it works best to keep balance. I don't drink, smoke or do drugs...however. I take carbs in moderation. If you find yourself eating too many carbs try increasing your protein and vegetables to help fill you up.
@claudia_mutti I love all kinds of music, right now I am listening to a lot of @coldplay and classical music.
@BobLiggett Thank you Bob! Hope you have a great day.
@raimifan Well I do love rice and beans! A quinoa salad is also incredible with avocado and whatever vegetables we have in the kitchen.
@Marcelo03 Absolutely! Flowers, trees, grass...SUNLIGHT! All of these beautiful things are at the foundation of healthy life. I appreciate, and integrate nature into my life as much as possible. In fact, I'm constantly outside with Bea...going on nature walks and exploring. I love it.
@melaniemorettis You are not alone. I think everyone has moments like this. Remember there is nothing more constant than change. I know it can be hard, but embrace your strengths, take pride in who you are. You are a beautiful person both inside and out. Don't let anyone tell you differently.
@Jessica_palm I have a place in my home where I go for some alone time when things get hectic, but spending time with my granddaughter is a game changer. When I'm with her it all goes away 💗
@KarbonikAnne No Kate is not on it to my knowledge and I don't have an air date yet, but I will post it here on as soon as it's announced.
@bikinimowing @Vitamix I do have @Vitamix and I make a green drink, which can be a mix of spinach, kale or broccoli. Sometimes I add apple to help with the taste and I find it very energizing. It changes from day to day, but it's a good way to start to the day
My chat starts in 5 minutes! Don't forget to send me your questions with #AskJaclyn 💗
Good morning! Looking forward to chatting you today at 10am. Tweet me your questions about living a healthy lifestyle with #AskJaclyn 😉
Does anyone remember the George Washington mini-series where I played Sally Fairfax? #FBF https://t.co/jjITrD7fju https://t.co/LZnXQ9gKjD
Having tea with my granddaughter Bea 💖 https://t.co/tinkX4WEnY https://t.co/llHslh95pl
I had a wonderful chat with you all today! I’ll be posting the date &amp; time for my next one soon. Any requests for chat topics? #AskJaclyn
@EddieCook14 How cool! My favorite thing is spending time with my granddaughter Bea.
@DrewellaDeVille I would suggest trying Pilates ;)
@SharonA25254459 I am well! My collection is available in store and online with @Kmart and @Sears ♡
@bikinimowing Hamburgers, pizza, gummi bears, running away with my granddaughter and turning my phone off...and antiquing.
@lalumir Thank you ♡
@danielskipsey I was definitely involved in the selection of @RealCherylLadd who I 100% voted for. I wasn't involved in the minor role casting, but when it came to angels they talked to us and I also voted for Shelley.
@LawrenceHughes No I wasn't, but I talked to people that she recommended and I read books that she thought I should read, which really opened up my perspective, giving me insight into her life.
@loriloriCM @ThisIsUsWriters and @TheCrownNetflix...how about you?
@WyAttDoRiAn We all have busy schedules so we stay in touch the best we can, we stay in touch mostly via phone but I would love to see them. #CharliesAngels
@WyAttDoRiAn The movie is called Married to a Stranger, yes it was me ;) and yes I did get my memory back, falling back in love with my husband who I had fallen out of love with.
@mnu160 I love the idea of the action of a superhero movie! I am currently watching a lot of @netflix movies...I love @TheCrownNetflix and @ThisIsUsWriters!
@agnetha666 Well, we all had our look...Kate made turtlenecks pop, Cheryl made bikinis fly off shelves and I had a more a classic look with flared bottoms, silk blouses and platform shoes! I think we all had such unique styles that it really offered something for everyone! #CharliesAngels
@3CupNannie @Kmart @Sears Thank you Nancy!
@DavieRiffraff60 Good morning! I am, hope you are too.
@RMS_78 Glad you enjoyed it!
@3CupNannie You can always shop my collection online but we are exclusively sold in @Kmart and @Sears ❤️
@krhugs You're welcome! That sounds lovely :)
@Marcelo03 thank you!
@KevyinNashville We have kept in touch, our schedules don't always line up, but we talk on the phone often. #charliesangels
@Leo_67 Absolutely, throughout my career I have always strived to challenge myself, to try new things. You should check out some of my movies ;)
@RodTaylorSite He was a excellent actor, but he was such a wildcard. I never knew what he would surprise me with. He was actually a lot like her father, I loved working with him because it challenged me to step up my game so I was performing at his level. It's really what every actor wants.
@JOJEHARVEY I can thanks to #Pilates.
@frostybias It was a brilliant movie. I found it interesting how so many people walked away with such different takes. Personally it seemed like he felt safer in prison and that he struggled with his own freedom. What was your take on it?
@gingersnap599 Just be with her, 24/7. I will say this, we took car rides together. Later towards the end of her life, we could drive for hours, just talking! Around Christmas time we would have so much fun just driving around and taking in all of the beautiful decorations.
@JFelipeTavaresA In the later movies the angels were portrayed as superheroes where as the original show was about real girls and their real experiences. It was more of a plausible real-life scenario. #CharliesAngels
@timwfortenberry Yes it's brass and I would say it's from the late 18th Century, maybe even early 1900s. They didn't have a lot of information on it when I bought it, it was in an antique department at @lordandtaylor.
@CovfefeAgent Thank you! You're so kind  ❤️
@EikangerEvan As a designer I like playing with trends. One thing I am thinking about recently is a small shoulder pad, not quite 80s volume, but I love to play with shapes and that's a fun easy way to make a big impact.
@reagan8675309 I was able to save some of the clothes, but I wish I had more. My daughter loves vintage and is always reminding me how many incredible pieces we got to wear on the show. Fashion is a revolving door that way, where things always come back in style...eventually. #charliesangels
@jjsmom2008 Thank you! I hope you have a great day too.
@ChiaraLove39 if you Google it you will find all kinds of good stuff ;)
@JakeSteele2650 @HarveyLevinTMZ @FoxNews Thank you
@WaltsPrincesss @HarveyLevinTMZ @FoxNews Thank you!
@timwfortenberry It's a very cool show :)
@BrianSol3 @HarveyLevinTMZ @FoxNews Glad you enjoyed it!
@RobertBucher8 Thank you Robert!
@MarkCNC64 @HarveyLevinTMZ @FoxNews thank you!
@Mikeyfreshh @HarveyLevinTMZ I'm so glad you enjoyed it!
Good morning everyone! I am online now taking your questions. Remember to include #AskJaclyn in your tweets.
#FBF to when Charlie got a new Angel. What fun we had in Hawaii. Have an exceptional holiday weekend #CharliesAngels https://t.co/w9qG4iagLq https://t.co/JYUVbIBkRk
I hope you will tune in to the season finale of #OBJECTified with @HarveyLevinTMZ this Sunday at 5pm PT (8pm ET) on @FoxNews. Watch this clip for a  preview and a quick look at one of my most cherished possessions, a gift from Farrah. I can't wait to hear what you think. https://t.co/9mciCT5M5o
Thank you all again for a fun chat! I will be back next Wednesday at the  same time 10am PT (1pm ET). I loved chatting style!! What would you  like to chat about? #AskJaclyn
@loriloriCM Yes! We launched the layette last fall and as she grows we go up in size. So that is my goal. I would love to follow her all the way up!
@melaniemorettis Absolutely not, but it's a beautiful language! I wish I could answer that in a yes. I hope you have an amazing day too! Thank you for writing.
@nelli_molinari I think the great thing about my line at @kmart/@sears is you can invest in a new color without breaking the bank. It's always nice to freshen up a look with a dash of color...so I would say go for it!
@taybaby_45 I like interchangeable separates where you can easily shift from day to night, but always refined with classic lines.
@AJLuna Absolutely! I will be on @FoxNews this Sunday 9/2 at 5pm PT for the season finale of #OBJECTified. I hope you will watch it and let me know what you think.
@mccarthy_tom My mother inspired my look.
@bikinimowing Yes! Less is more. I love clean classic lines.
@LawrenceHughes I think because I had a very fashionable mother I was aware of fashion. I remember buying sweatshirts, cutting them to change their necklines and dying them to match my shoes (and vice versa)....so yes I guess I have always been interested in fashion.
@BerzyPeter I'm wonderful! Hope you are too!!
@krhugs Absolutely! Most of my designs are available in plus sizes at @kmart and @sears.
@gracefulheaven1 I am actually working on a mask for my line right now that tightens and moisturizes! Stay tuned for info on when it is launching 😉
@JesseAguilar520 I am a hat person and the ones I've designed for my lines at @kmart and @sears are easy to pack while staying stylish! Protecting your skin is essential so lets all be hat people!
@sarahsmate Not at the moment, but I am always looking at new projects. Keep checking in as I will post any upcoming appearances and roles right here on my social channels.
@MesaAZ424 It was Angels in Chains, we were actually chained together...LOL! There were a lot of laughs, we had so much fun! You absolutely can!! Please email contact@jaclynsmith.com for an autograph. #CharliesAngels
@RMS_78 I didn't get to meet @SenJohnMcCain, although I would have loved to...A true American hero who above all else loved this country. He was a TOTAL MAN, a wonderful husband and father. He fought for what he thought was right, creating bi-partisan action. He will be deeply missed.
@sarverpa Some pieces were donated, some probably kept by the studio and I did get to keep some, although I wish I had kept more. My daughter loves vintage and she's always reminding me how fabulous the clothes were from the show 😉
@JChergi It's ALWAYS a winner. Red mixes so well w/other colors, but when done right it can really go w/anything. It's a neutral in disguise. As far as detectives you would want to stick with comfortable clothes in neutral colors so you can get in &amp; out of a place without being noticed.
@SharonA25254459 Yes there will be some warmer colors as well.
@DrCristianLeite Excellent! He was the soul, he brought us all together, he made us laugh. There were 18 hour work days where we were tired, but his charisma and experience brought so much joy to all of us.
@nikkike77122995 I do Pilates frequently, not always every day, usually 3x a week. I also eat well and take great care of my skin using my skincare line. Check it out at https://t.co/q0tXJF9GOR
@loriloriCM The suits were fitted and it was also a time where details down to hats, shoes and gloves were all coordinated to the outfit.
@loriloriCM I agree with you about the 40s, it was the most feminine and elegant time in fashion!
@reagan8675309 Yes I did get to keep some! Some pieces are in a closet for all time...I wish I had kept more because my daughter LOVES vintage. We sometimes tend to let go of things, forgetting that they will be back in style again. Fashion is a revolving door that way.
@EikangerEvan I think a slight shoulder pad, not quite as dramatic as the 80s...but I love the shape they can provide. I also love pencil skirts and crop jackets. We are releasing crop jackets in my fall line at @sears and @kmart. They are figure flattering to all shapes!
@krhugs Thank you! Thank you!!
@CeeLoGrey We like to stick with traditional fall colors but with a hint of tropicals...like corals mixed with gold and of course animal prints. There will also be a lot of vegan leather due to popular demand! @Kmart @Sears
@ValentineMagic I love that! @Kmart
@HailLuty Completely agree!
My chat starts now! Please send me your questions with #AskJaclyn. Today we are focusing on personal style, but I am happy to discuss other topics as well 😉
My next chat is Wednesday 8/29 at 10am PT (1pm ET)! Tweet me your questions with #AskJaclyn, with fall coming up...let’s talk style 😉
We always hear how time flies, here’s proof! How lucky I am to have Bea so I can enjoy this age all over again. #FBF https://t.co/WfjkfJsbn0 https://t.co/R9ehB7bhpK
Thank you again to everyone who joined today's chat! Are you all enjoying these? I want to hear from you! What topics would you like to chat about?
@JesseAguilar520 I am doing great! I am hoping to spend time with my family this weekend, my kids and my granddaughter!!
@candymarietayl1 She wanted to pursue other things ;)
@sterling4nikki I love that the show concept still resonates with viewers and I would love to see a TV reboot. Thank you for the compliment, the movie is called Cries Unheard: The Donna Yaklich Story.
@PJ_Keegan723 I just spoke to Cheryl yesterday, it can be hard with all of our schedules to get everyone in the same place at the same time.
@AdamMichaelHay4 Absolutely! I consider @RealCherylLadd and #KateJackson close friends. #CharliesAngels
@TheDanTheMan58 Very cool and very generous.
@JennyChaban I love @ThisIsUsWriters, @DowntownAbbyBC and @MrSelfridge 💖
@markworth0510 After having children they became my priority and it's a role I wouldn't trade for anything.
@valorie_young I think it's a good idea, it's such a winning concept. I would love to see the original angels involved too...I guess we will just have to wait and see.
@bmcpherson I do! Stay tuned for updates on what I'm working on next ;)
@Marcelo03 Thank you 💖
@LawrenceHughes I love Pilates! I even have a reformer in my home.
@LizzyLashMusic I have been very fortunate as I haven't had a negative experience working in the industry. I believe in a healthy lifestyle; staying active, eating well and taking great care of my skin.
@KFMovieGuy One funny thing that stands out is I had to have a moving van to carry all of our luggage since I was traveling with my husband at the time and our children! When Richard saw all of it he was laughing...he was hoping it wasn't all my clothes.
@wvpirate @coolhandlou2 was my mentor when I started but even today he continues to coach me and help me hone my craft. He's an Emmy-nominated director, but most importantly a dear friend.
@delwilliams Hi Del! I am and I hope you are too 💖
@melaniemorettis I feel wonderful 💖
@mikepingel @AETV @AlanaKStewart What an incredible collection! #CharliesAngels
@wilee12 Robert Mitchum was such a talented actor and it was daunting for me to work with him at first, but at heart he was a very down to earth man who made me feel comfortable and at ease. It was a pleasure to work with him.
@JChergi I would absolutely say the Houston @Astros because I love baseball and I love Houston! I love @TheCrownNetflix and am excited for it come back for season 3.
@CovfefeAgent I did not date David Cassidy, but I think he was dating everyone else in town...he was very popular. Being on The Partridge Family was so much fun that all these years later it still stands out to me.
@ChiaraLove39 They were shot at 20th Century Fox, it was actually a set. #CharliesAngels
@MarkCNC64 I signed for 5 and I was ready to move on, but regardless it was an experience I will always be grateful for. #CharliesAngels
@WeightLorna I think a healthy living is always good: a good diet, staying active and excellent skincare. I use my own products to learn more about them visit: https://t.co/q0tXJF9GOR
@lauraanne0608 Thank you! It's very flattering.
@mnu160 Here I am 💖
@BerzyPeter Thank you! I hope you're well too :)

Kmart circa 1986 – what a story was born. Thank you @Kmart for 33 years and counting ❤️ #FBF https://t.co/jKu71lWvSi https://t.co/8N6Zq6CsbV
Thank you all for a great chat today! I will continue answering questions and be back next week for another.
@delwilliams Just beautiful!
@LawrenceHughes Well said Lawrence ✌️
@little_yootha I love the UK! I post all my appearance announcements here on social so keep a look out ;)
@DrCristianLeite It's such a beautiful song!
@melaniemorettis It's so sad, but it's a blessing to still have her music.
@1chris_jones No but I would like to!
@RMS_78 Yes! That was my dog Albert, he was on several shows and he was a star. Look for him at the beginning of this video ;) https://t.co/0O1BiVhLEQ
@velda_57 Forever 💖
@pewilliams58 So many hits!
@delwilliams Hi Del! I'm going to have to look that up!
@secret_ledger That must be incredible!
@rjc1960_richard We never met, but I was touched by her music.
@LawrenceHughes Seems like to many to count 💖
@loriloriCM Chain of Fools is one of my favorites!!
@kayette79 Classic!!
@partyof17still That's a good one!
@LeesaSawyer_13 It came to me from my parents, to be true to myself. My parents embodied such a beautiful ideal to me and their advice always resonated with me in such a deep and meaningful way.
@Chanelhousewife I use all my own products, you can see the line and videos of my routine by visiting: https://t.co/q0tXJF9GOR -- my husband has continuously refined the products to integrate the latest trends in the beauty industry.
@SmarshMary I went to the Jersey Shore and loved it!
@dctvlezzy187 Not well...I think when three siblings are separated like that and they don't really know their history and what happened the reunion is wonderful, but the fallout of having to deal with it would be very difficult to handle.
@LeesaSawyer_13 Daring and fearless...it goes to places I never dreamed it would go. There's some wonderful acting, but some times the subject matter can be too much. In the right hands it works, when it's not it can be negative to me.
@Natasha20M Regret steals from the present. I love my life so I couldn't imagine changing anything.
@StephBaughn It's hard to simplify in 140 characters, but I raised my children to create and follow their own dreams. To know that hard work, integrity and faith will lead them to a life full of love and happiness. To know that you only fail if you don't learn from your mistakes.
@loriloriCM We love music, playing with her toys and having tea in her doll house. She also loves puzzles, even at her young age. We always have the best time.
@marliemom3089 I stay active and love Pilates. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day for me, lunch we keep light and dinner I always start with salad, followed by organic protein and veggies...and we finish with a dessert which can be as simple as chilled watermelon.
@WeightLorna Not at the moment, but I make all my announcements on social so stay tuned.
@EikangerEvan @RealCherylLadd She used to sing on the set, "Where The Boys Are" she would just burst into song and she always sang beautifully. I don't think she recorded it tho...it was just for us!
@dvdminshall Ida Lupino and Louis Jourdan both stood out to me because I watched them growing up. I mean Louis starred in Gigi, one of my favorite movies growing up.
@karlamc65 I'm originally from Houston and no new roles to report today although I am constantly reviewing scripts looking for my next one.
@melaniemorettis ;)
@BerzyPeter I'm great Berzy! How are you?

@krhugs Hands down Angels in Chains...we had so much fun filming it! #CharliesAngels
@ScottWhitley11 I actually prefer to take on new roles that people haven't seen before, but I'm always up for a challenge!
Don't forget to use #AskJaclyn when you send your questions ;)
Good morning everyone, sorry to hear the news this morning, but looking forward to speaking with all of you. What was your favorite Aretha song? I have several but one of my favorites is "Say A Little Prayer." https://t.co/Ygf0DcjIX3 #ArethaQueenForever
We will miss you Aretha! She lives on with her beautiful music and voice, which will always be a part of my life forever. #ArethaQueenForever
I love this interview! It was about beginnings and possibilities. Do you remember it? https://t.co/0O1BiVhLEQ #CharliesAngels

With my team at #Trend for the launch of my @Fabricut wallcoverings. They coordinate with my fabrics beautifully! https://t.co/tQRScYInYo https://t.co/tsYcOEW3ui
Having fun with Bea at @KathyHilton and #RickHilton’s granddaughter, Lily Grace’s 2nd Birthday! https://t.co/oTZ2zCQPlZ https://t.co/2tAiDtlReq
Thank you all for another fun chat and keep a look out for the next one! Have a wonderful day 💖
@carolynjmoore2 No, but I will be going out soon to New Braunfels to visit my brother and his wife.
@little_yootha Yes I do! I have a silk shirt that from #CharliesAngels that I love. I will try and post it ;)
@kernowman63 There are so many! Robert Wagner is one of my favorites and I loved Armand Assante...Angela Lansbury was another incredible actress, one of the most professional people I've ever worked with. I also enjoyed working with #HaydenChristensen and @HilarySwank 💖
@Deana828 A lot of @coldplay, #EarthWindandFire, @AndreaBocelli and a lot of classical and the classics! I really love it all.
@JChergi Q1 - no, not for me. || Q2 - Angels in Chains. || Q3 - her humor 💖
@rayraynic1 Hi Del! I am passing on our Christmas traditions. When she gets older I am going to do for her when I did for my children where I give her a day to choose whatever she wants to do. It would just be the two of us spending some special time together.
@JoelGotlibTV Thank you! I don't have plans at the moment or upcoming projects to share, but I always post upcoming appearances and roles here on social so stay tuned.
@CHGOECONOMIST I love spending time with my granddaughter Bea 💖
@Deana828 I would love it if I found the right one! It's my beginnings it my history -- dance and music.
@DavidatOmega thank you 💖
@SouthsideNinja1 I never played them, but my children did and I know a lot of people have a lot of fun with them.
@secret_ledger Definitely let me know what you find. #CharliesAngels
@Marcelo03 I was dreaming about it the minute she got married and I will do the same with Gaston. I am an old fashioned girl, I like the marriage before the baby. I gotta tell you, I love every minute of it. I think she's the most incredible little girl in the world!
@Deana828 We did as much of the stunts as they would let us. #CharliesAngels
@denisecahoon4 Green, every shade of it!
@wvpirate There were a few projects, the first that comes to mind is a James Bond Movie followed by American Gigolo when John Travolta was still attached to the project.
@KamsMadrid We had our stunt coordinator teach us things to keep us safe, there wasn't any extensive training but we were all very agile and wanted to do as much of our stunts as they would let us. #CharliesAngels
@candidcorinth First and foremost I would say Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy and I love period pieces, so next I would say George Washington followed by Florence Nightingale.
@eeriejeff I think it's a winning concept and it keeps the story alive. As long as they maintain the integrity of the original story I'm all for it.
@JackPhi93877782 Michelle Pfeiffer, Connie Sellecca, Cristina Ferrare are some that come to mind, but I am firm believer that what's meant to be will be ;)
@Ynot_t Yes! The theme and I swear I hear it everywhere. It's even on our doorbell in Santa Barbara. #CharliesAngels
@CornuJoannele @ChiaraLove39 Keep checking in. I will definitely post updates here.
@loriloriCM Awe, thank you! I always post about upcoming appearances. So keep checking in.
@Bf28Edward I believe it's usually "Shift + 3" ;)
@jasonhe89624994 A scene that comes to mind is from the second season where Kate was off camera trying to get me to laugh...but there were so many moments... #CharliesAngels
@secret_ledger Was that the one with Patrick Duffy?
@lugosiwashere Absolutely! Not from an episodic point of view, but I would love to develop a show from script to production. I think having that kind of creative control would be an exciting challenge to take on.
@CathyCagle1 No, just my Bea and she's the light of our lives 💖
@RMS_78 Definitely a LA @Dodgers game, not a Lakers game and it's just because baseball is my favorite sport.
@gingersnap599 Yes I did ;)
@ChiaraLove39 Nothing is planned yet, but I am definitely open to it.
@Jeans_Keller @RealCherylLadd I would love that!
My Twitter Chat starts now! Make sure to include #AskJaclyn in your tweets and I will answer as many questions as I can.
My next Twitter chat starts at 10am PT (1pm ET). Tweet me your questions with #AskJaclyn. Talk soon!!
Some fun #MaxFactor ads from Japan. #FBF 良い週末を https://t.co/uDHyit6Wg9 https://t.co/7KniVfJFmN
@brookeeaton Likes: family, dogs, family farm in Texas, antiques and gummy bears || Dislikes: drugs/alcohol, unkind/rude people, lying, prejudice and pretension
@Daisy099 Sorry for the delay! Gone with the Wind is my favorite movie. It’s timeless. The characters are memorable and fantastic each and everyone.
@dvdminshall I was offered a role, but not the doctor ;)
@dangertheatre I made her my own. All the girls put their own personality into the part to make all three angels unique. #CharliesAngels
@BrianSLSpringer I would love to do a musical with @RealHughJackman. He is so multi-talented!
@sarverpa Wash your face day and night followed with a moisturizer. I also love blush, it gives a fresh look.
@IsobelAura I believe in prayer. I kneel. I always pray before bed at night, but not necessarily in the same location.
@RMS_78 It's not frustrating, but tragic and sad. People have lost their homes and property and some have even lost their lives...
@corkysherwood I don't see your question anymore, but my answer is to live beyond yourself. Find an area where you can help others. It changes how you see yourself and the world 💖
Thank you all for another fun chat! Keep sending me questions with #AskJaclyn and I will be back next week. Have a wonderful day 💖
@aarconv I have all kinds of mementos, but mostly clothing and merchandise that came after the show.
@gthigpen4x Hi Glenn! Yes I do ;)
@LindaTa35025738 Thank you for the sweet Tweet and the cute photo 💖
@JamesKittoPhoto Hi James! We always filmed separately.
@Deana828 We don't because it can be hard with all of our schedules, but I know we would all love to.
@drinaldioficial I don't have one special place, there are pieces throughout the house.
@Jerms_78 I do love to sing, but it's mostly off screen...like when my makeup artist and I sing Broadway show tunes while I get my make up done ;)
@bikinimowing My son's dog Bear is a rescue 💖
@dugsr1 My granddaughter Bea!
@KFMovieGuy The most challenging role for me was playing Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, but I loved it.
@0773heidi I loved playing Jennifer Parker in Rage of Angels.
@SharonA25254459 There will be grey, lavender and blue tones.
@alygirl_7 No I do not, but I love music 💖
@Kevin8404 One of my favorite items is a #CharliesAngels pinball machine.
@MissCharlotte47 It is also available online at https://t.co/Fant5I1ebD and https://t.co/5jN9ZBlh9U ;)
@Stan_Stinson I am always reviewing scripts for my next role, but nothing new to  report at the moment. Keep checking in tho as I will announce new  projects on my social channels ;)
@gthigpen4x Absolutely 💖
@Marcelo03 All kinds! I go from classical music that I grew up on to rock to opera. I love almost everything!
@mnu160 Thank you 💖
@HoskinsonK Thank you!
@delwilliams It has allowed me to connect with people in a way I wasn't able to in the past, like these chats. I would say it has had a positive impact, and I don't use influencers...just my own social channels.
@loriloriCM I absolutely adore the classics! Both Cary and Gene were fabulous!!
@CEALedwithaKiss @KellyRipaFan72 Thank you!
@WhitfieldPaul To request an autograph please email contact@jaclynsmith.com 💖
@valorie_young I have various items from shooting the show as well as merchandise I collected over the years.
@BerzyPeter Thank you 💖
@mamma_val_1 @GettyMuseum Thank you!
@rjc1960_richard I am always looking at scripts to find my next role, but nothing that I am moving forward with at this time. Keep checking in as I will post new projects here on social first.
@kenn264 ...One of my favorite memories of Farrah was when she brought me her homemade chocolate cake that she baked for me herself 💖
@JaxSummersMusic It was wonderful meeting you as well!
@CathyCagle1 I do as I still have family in the area.
@SandyH1111 I have been very blessed in my career, and I am excited to begin work on my book.
@hackysackgirl Thank you Meena 💖
@enriqueskincare I am happy to respond to your question, but I don't see it?
@greg_lema There have been a couple, but I don't regret the decisions ;)
@DotTayl85465037 💖
@joeysnack Thank you so much Joe! I had a lot of say on the wardrobe and it was one of many parts of working on #CharliesAngels that I loved. I wish I had kept more pieces, especially because my daughter loves vintage clothing so much.
@gingersnap599 I have so many, but one that stands out was when we shot "Angels in Chains," we were actually all chained together...there was a lot of laughter and even more fun. It was a great day! #CharliesAngels
@carolynjmoore2 It's OK! Thank you for the sweet Tweet ;)
@BerzyPeter Good morning! I am doing well. How are you?
@raymondkenny2 I have begun the process and it's a big undertaking but I am excited about it. I will post updates as I work through it.
Good morning! I am online now answering your questions. Tweet me with #AskJaclyn and I will answer as many as I can over the next hour 💖

Got to spend the day at the @GettyMuseum with my granddaughter Bea over the weekend! https://t.co/okfLwBdwpm https://t.co/5cMpJNUYYF
I have always made my life about family, so has @kmart/@sears. I love this company! #FBF https://t.co/viB2Ba6F3a https://t.co/TselE4IS6R
#MaxFactor was the master of the game inspiring so many others. Love that his genius is still alive in the... https://t.co/5IjgRUhFbv #TBT https://t.co/qVEr4XC1rS
Thank you all for chatting with me! I will be back next week. Keep sending questions with #AskJaclyn ❤️
@Jessica_palm we all try our best to stay in touch.
@lrivers56 I think it’s great! I love that the show still resonates with viewers.
@GoldenRageofTV1 not that are planned, but I always post about upcoming appearances on my social media...so stay tuned.
@DidanDillon absolutely! I loved working with the cast.
@jobean_1964 I didn't get to explore a lot because my schedule at the time could be 15 hour days. It was a very place tho and there were always people out waiting to meet me. We shot that movie in multiple locations and I only got to sight see where we were shooting.
@danielskipsey Meeting Elizabeth Taylor was an exciting moment for me. She was such a nice person!
@rdonlyforus He tells me his dog is doing very well, she is extremely well trained. She's growing fast, going to be a big dog. I will try to get a more recent picture.
@Deana828 Absolutely! I would love it if the role is right and the script is good.
@mccarthy_tom No I was doing mini-series during that time and I loved what I was doing at the time. That format is my favorite.
@Deana828 It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the photos and this sweet message!
@clairekerrbear She's not only an excellent actress she's a nice person...so welcoming! I love NYC, the challenge of the role, it was a great experience.
@MetalFanInBlack That I don't know, but it would be great to see them at a show!
@Lindy2u My childhood, my parents, my grandfather...it's a time I remember as better than happy 💖
@BerzyPeter I'm wonderful! How are you?
@Deana828 I love traveling across Europe. It changes all the time, all vacations are my favorites...I would love to do a safari with my family.
@COLBobLegg Some of the most fun was when we shot in Hawaii for the second series, but the best part was and will always be the friendship with the girls. #CharliesAngels
@tracyenns_tle No, but we enjoyed the beach every day with family...a lot of barbecuing!
@CeeLoGrey I have a toy poodle named Honeybun, a standard poodle named Elizabeth (after Elizabeth Taylor), and my daughter's dog Grace who's a French Bulldog.
@ChiaraLove39 I am in contact with Kate and Cheryl, but I haven't talked to Shelley or Tanya in a while. We should have a reunion.
@rhone69300 Good morning!
@rhone69300 Thank you!
@darcmichlyon I'm reading The American Wife right now and one of my favorite books is Beach Music by Pat Conroy.
@RMS_78 Oh yeah and I did most of them because of the popularity of #CharliesAngels.
@zainfan1 LOL!
@CHGOECONOMIST Right here ;)
@SandyH1111 @RealCherylLadd Absolutely! She's a great actress and a great friend, we would have fun.
@scottwrynn I would have to say Jesus Christ.
@Marcelo03 I have, where you go and you feel like you've been there. The memories of it feel like dreams though, don't they?
@claudia_mutti I love This Is Us, SVU, The Crown, Downtown Abbey and Parenthood. I also enjoy the mini-series format and historical docu-series.
@nada0971 Healthy living, I've never drank, smoked or done drugs. I am happy girl and I like to think that helps as well :)
@jun_lmhs My career started in dance and music and @RealCherylLadd had a musical background as well so we had a lot of fun with it.
@kernowman63 Absolutely! Email contact@jaclynsmith.com ;)
@dugsr1 I partnered with @kmart in 1985 and have continued working with them ever since.
@GunnKassidy Thank you! I always say if the script is right I would do it.
@SharonA25254459 I'm wonderful! Thank you so much.

So great catching up with my dear friend @AlanaKStewart! Such a fun day, had to #repost it ❤️ https://t.co/RZmYgFVZpk https://t.co/cHaj7Arq5V
Dance has been my passion since I was 3 years old. #FBF https://t.co/Zb5xfpdX5D https://t.co/lA4Dj0o6rw
Had a wonderful time shooting with @HarveyLevinTMZ for OBJECTified. Keep an eye out for my interview in September! https://t.co/JsnUtGX3i6 https://t.co/Um663464Gm
Thank you all for taking the time to chat with me today! I will be back next week. Please send me questions with #AskJaclyn and I will do my best to get back to you during my next chat.
@avasman @Cheriav Wow thank you :) #AskJaclyn
@plcjoanne Thank you so much!
@Lou915Linda Thank you! I love the compilation episodes because they bring back so many great memories. My secret for staying young? I would like to think it's that I exercise regularly with Pilates, eat well and take great care of my skin with my skincare line. #AskJaclyn
@southernvl1 Thank you!
@aarconv It was incredible, it's so beautiful! You know, I love family and heritage so seeing where my husband grew up while spending time with his extended family was wonderful. #AskJaclyn
@ChiaraLove39 She was a ray of light...making everyone around her laugh and smile. She was also incredibly thoughtful and caring. I'm so blessed to have known her. #AskJaclyn
@southernvl1 I sure try to ;) #AskJaclyn
@little_yootha Thank you so much! Big love back from the US! #AskJaclyn
@phoenix_elvis I love it! #AskJaclyn
@Sasha2788 I love that! #AskJaclyn
@phoenix_elvis Shooting the episode "Angels in Chains," we were literally chained together, but we had so much fun. It was a lot of work, but there was so much joy and laughter. We really had an incredible connection that I will cherish forever. #AskJaclyn
@little_yootha I am always looking for my next role. When I find the right script it will happen. #AskJaclyn
@farfantv Thank you for the support and I love Argentina! It's a beautiful country!! #AskJaclyn
@Cheriav You can find my full lines online as well :) #AskJaclyn
@BillBukauskas I do and my first love was from childhood he took me swimming and we had so much fun together -- I saw him years later and immediately recognized him at a @Kmart event I was hosting. I looked out into the crowd and even in the see of people I found him right away, looking good!
@jusegu No but I would love to visit! #AskJaclyn
@LisaGiesler There's no topic, I'm an open book ;) #AskJaclyn
@chocolotto12 My exercise right now is Pilates, I do it on the reformer and I love it. I still dance, just in my house with my granddaughter. #AskJaclyn
@phoenix_elvis No, but I wish I did, it's a beautiful language. #AskJaclyn
@loril_4 That's a very difficult question, but it makes me think of 1985 where I had all of my loved ones with me except for my grandfather. It was a very special time to me. I'm so glad my parents got to see the joy that becoming a mother brought to my life. #AskJaclyn
@Nema1963 At the time it was actually quite easy ;) #AskJaclyn
@KarbonikAnne Yes! I haven't in a while because he went to college. He is a great young man, Kate and him are very close. It's great to see! #AskJaclyn
@kernowman63 I love England and London. In fact we hope to come visit before the end of the year. It will be a lot of fun! My children's father is from London and they have duel citizenship. #AskJaclyn
Good morning everyone!! I'm loving chatting with you. Keep the questions coming with #AskJaclyn
@loriloriCM You among many lol! He is a dream man, he is the personification of an elegant man. With him I am always laughing. He really was the perfect leading man. #AskJaclyn
@IsobelAura God is prayer and prayer is so a part of my life. It's a constant thing for me, because it's part of me. Having children increased the volume of my prayers and further strengthened my relationship with god. #AskJaclyn
@SuzFromTheSouth Farrah and I definitely had a lot of interest and input. We both loved clothes and were always involved. There isn't an outfit that stands out but there are several pieces I have that have a lot of sentimental value to me. #AskJaclyn
@plcjoanne I would love to extensively travel throughout Africa. In fact, it's a dream of mine to do an African Safari with my family. #AskJaclyn
@TheRetroPixie No he was never on the set, but I had the pleasure of working on him for The Users and he was one of the most elegant men I've ever met. #AskJaclyn
@WeightLorna I have always admired the men and women of the police force, but I was always more drawn to being a detective. #AskJaclyn
@MagnaChristian4 It starts with a great script. From there you need a solid work ethic, you also need to take the time to prepare for a role, and finally to immerse yourself in that character (especially how they develop). #AskJaclyn
@bluegirl_mayu16 I do make appearances and I post them here on my social media. I would love to see you too and have been to Japan in the past. It's a beautiful country! #AskJaclyn
@jeannie524yahoo I do! You can shop it at @Sears and @Kmart in-store + online.
Good morning! My next chat starts in 2 hours at 10am PT (1pm PT). Tweet me your questions with #AskJaclyn. See you soon!
We did this shoot for a cover and feature in @TIME Magazine. It didn't make the... https://t.co/ZYbz3u3z6D #CharliesAngels #FBF https://t.co/JJtJ5vpNDa

I do love a good peach pie...  https://t.co/8GlFJiNN5R
Thank you all for chatting with me! I love connecting with all of you. Stay tuned for my next one. #AskJaclyn
@Jessejeepjag That is so kind of you to say! I eat well, stay active and take care of my skin. #AskJaclyn
@zainfan1 This is so cute! #AskJaclyn
@kevin15000 We all do our best to stay in touch, it's always good to hear from them. #AskJaclyn
@jaguarin66 You're so welcome!
@sarverpa Can you Tweet me the pic?
@RMS_78 It was wonderful, I got to spend it with my husband and his family. #AskJaclyn
@graciescarlet They are beautiful! #AskJaclyn
@little_yootha It is and I love that she has this!!
@KarbonikAnne Not right at this moment, but I am glad to hear you're enjoying it. #AskJaclyn
@jaguarin66 I would absolutely do it again. It changed my life and I got to meet so many incredible people. I would even be open to playing Kelly now, I love showing the passage of time and think it would be an interesting story to tell. #CharliesAngels #AskJaclyn
@LJGaeke @zainfan1 Happy Monday!
@JOJEHARVEY I would be a dog, because they are so loved and they make such a difference in the family. #AskJaclyn
@colleenlaffey It was my very first trip to the Jersey Shore. There were more than 40 people at the family reunion and now we are talking about doing it every two years! #AskJaclyn
@zainfan1 My granddaughter calls me Mimi and it's music to my ears. That's what my children called my mother. #AskJaclyn
@Marcelo03 No I didn't, but I am grateful for it! #AskJaclyn
@jkheels There is no routine, but it is always busy! I always start with a big breakfast but after that it could be anything...from a creative meeting with @Kmart or @Sears, to spending time with Bea, to yoga or pilates...there's always something to do. #AskJaclyn
@zainfan1 Thank you! I loved working on #SVU! It's one of the best shows, in fact I actually watch it! Such an incredible and welcoming cast! #AskJaclyn
@KeelievKruse I am in the process of writing a book right now. It's hard to find the time, but I am working on it ;) #AskJaclyn
@dugsr1 No, my mother wanted it as close to Jack, my father's name. My middle name Ellen comes from my mother's name. #AskJaclyn
@0773heidi I know there is a box set that was released by @Sony, but I am not sure about international availability. #AskJaclyn
@jjsmom2008 Happy Birthday Jeremy!!
@zainfan1 Hi Maranda!
@statenisland65 Nothing planned at the moment, but I will make announcements on social media as we confirm new appearances. #AskJaclyn
@tottee35 I actually just turned one down due to a scheduling conflict, but I am always looking for the next right script ;) #AskJaclyn
@BerzyPeter thank you!
@HarleyATC As most people know it's Angels in Chains, but the pilot also stands out because it was the beginning of everything. #CharliesAngels #AskJaclyn
@dugsr1 I actually just turned down a television movie because of a scheduling conflict. I am always looking for the right role, when I find it I will do it. No plans to give up acting or design. #AskJaclyn
@zainfan1 There have been a couple, but I don't regret the decisions ;) #AskJaclyn
@danielskipsey Everyone knows me for being organized, but I love an unstructured day where I don't have a schedule to follow. #AskJaclyn
@loriloriCM I love to have an unstructured day, read on my balcony or play with my dogs, but really I count the minutes until my granddaughter comes and that is the highlight of my day. #AskJaclyn
@MagnaChristian4 The final episode, knowing that was it after 5 years. It was bittersweet, you want to move on to new things, but it is hard to say good bye. #AskJaclyn
@csarinab No, but I would love to go! #AskJaclyn
@little_yootha Oh yes! I have dolls, cards, games...even a pinball machine which was gifted to me by Jack Condon who wrote a book on #CharliesAngels. #AskJaclyn
@charmedboi Everyone who I worked with had special qualities. I loved them all, I couldn't choose a favorite. #AskJaclyn #CharliesAngels
@GiordanoZach I went to La Mar high school. I wasn't in the district, but I got a transfer so I could be with all my friends ;) #AskJaclyn
@DrCristianLeite It makes me happy to see a show like that still have such a presence today. It's surprising, but I love it! #AskJaclyn #CharliesAngels
@SouthsideNinja1 All kinds! I go from classical music that I grew up on to rock to opera. I love almost everything! As a matter of fact I am going to the Hollywood Bowl tomorrow to hear Beethoven. #AskJaclyn
@MetalFanInBlack I can't wait to see Three Identical Strangers, but the last one I saw was Book Club. It was great fun, love the actors and it had a nice message. #AskJaclyn
@0773heidi We were so fortunate to have countless talented actors, one thing that really stands out to me though were the classically trained "movie" actors who crossed over into TV. It was a big deal having the original BIG HOLLYWOOD stars on our set. #AskJaclyn #CharliesAngels
@khub19 Whether it's today, tomorrow or any other time you have to be true to yourself. It's a question of power, and when something doesn't feel right just walk away. Nothing (no role) is worth sacrificing your integrity. #AskJaclyn
@tonymelchiore I LOVE the Jersey Shore, it is such a beautiful place. I love seeing him spend time with his family, to share that with him is wonderful. It's his history. It's where he's from. #AskJaclyn

Thank you all again for a wonderful chat yesterday. I love getting to connect with you 💖 #AskJaclyn
@hijproductions Regardless of the project I always prefer reading a script printed out. I am not a fan of reading on a computer. #AskJaclyn
@MelissaSommer3 I feel very fortunate and blessed to work. I have gratitude to have played so many roles and the ones you mentioned are some of my favorite. The generational element of Family Album was so meaningful to me. #AskJaclyn
@grahamkaye74 Job satisfaction 100% #AskJaclyn
@steve45220 They usually get permission, but some times it doesn't happen. I don't think they did for the "Jaclyn Smith hair" in Steel Magnolias. However, I was so flattered by that! #AskJaclyn
@Superman_33 We all see each other when we can, but I would love to see them more. I just got a text from Kate with a Randy Newman song...did you know she sends the best texts? #AskJaclyn
@Ynot_t They offered it, but it just hasn't worked out...I never say never tho ;) #AskJaclyn
@little_yootha My favorite show right now is @ThisIsUsWriters #AskJaclyn
@MetalFanInBlack No but my husband loves it so I catch up that way. #AskJaclyn
@_scottclarke Nothing at the moment, but always looking for the next right role. #AskJaclyn
@jjsmom2008 You are so welcome and I am glad you enjoy them. Have a wonderful day! #AskJaclyn
@PattyCaro3 Thank you so much for the sweet message! That's my favorite episode too!! #AskJaclyn
@little_yootha At first it was pretty intimidating, enlightening, exciting, fun...but also scary. There is so much I learned after the fact, acting in a series is so much work and I loved every moment of it. #AskJaclyn
@familyhopefund I love raising awareness for @AbilityFirstLA because of everything they do for people with disabilities. They create an environment where everyone feels they belong and are valued. #AskJaclyn
@BrianSLSpringer I am not necessarily into the traditional superhero genre. I love stories that make superheroes out of regular people. I have always loved playing characters that could exist in the real world. In fact, I would like to think that #CharliesAngels were superheroes. #AskJaclyn
@JChergi I did go to Studio 54, but not with the other angels and in regards to Natalie Wood I met her when I worked with her husband Robert Wagner, but we never got to work together. I would have loved to, she was so talented. #AskJaclyn
@jun_lmhs I went to Japan when I launched my fragrance, California. I traveled all over, at the time people in Japan were focused on skincare so it was fun to bring something new. #AskJaclyn
@FRADINEric1 I'm so glad you liked it. Thank you for your kind words! #AskJaclyn
@tmmytylr Hello ;)
@danielskipsey Well @kathyireland and I met through the same management company, starting with doing a few photoshoots together. She is a Christian woman who practices what she preaches. Truly a wonderful person. #AskJaclyn
@My_Solo_Life A special memory, she said she had a surprise for me...just come! It turned out to be bronze sculpture, it now sits in our time/living room. It came w/a special note that means so much &amp; I see that sculpture every day. She made it for me with her own hands. I love it. #AskJaclyn
@claudia_mutti I've been all over Italy...to Rome, Florence, Venice, Positano, Capri and Milan. I also love Italian food, but American home cooking is always my favorite. #AskJaclyn
I'm online for the next 30 minutes! Excited to chat with all of you ;) #AskJaclyn
My next Twitter Chat starts at 10am PT this morning. You can Tweet me your questions now with #AskJaclyn! Talk soon!!
We were honored to learn that both Prince Phillip and Prince Charles were fans of #CharliesAngels... https://t.co/TPwe5kbqsJ #FBF https://t.co/YB87mO1R10
I love this... https://t.co/vVzOr2vNBM @Sears

My father wasn’t just there for me on Father’s Day, he was there for me every day. Happy Father’s Day Daddy ❤️ https://t.co/02r1xQqm6t https://t.co/TGTzqZdsUi
I love working with roses. These are from my very own garden. The beauty and scent make a room come alive. https://t.co/FjlGLZJ87D https://t.co/wqTUetZ00l
I couldn’t think of a better fellow angel. Loved seeing this today! @victoriabeckham’s one of my favorite designers. https://t.co/WzVlyeEeYh https://t.co/uegdDqvfWo
1983 – Sidney Sheldon’s Rage of Angels. Loved doing this movie and I got the opportunity to work with two of my favorite actors Ken Howard and Armand Assante. https://t.co/XAqErFADZ5 https://t.co/xvwRXTl0xD
In beautiful High Point, NC with @Fabricut and I’m on my way to the Showtime Market. https://t.co/tkJw9URkoB https://t.co/EA7GSLFPgQ
I did an interview with fellow Texans about my childhood and growing up in Texas. It was such fun reminiscing about all of those wonderful memories that will be a part of my life forever. https://t.co/jlg23jxdBZ
I did an interview with fellow Texans about my childhood &amp; growing up in Texas. It was such fun reminiscing about... https://t.co/RRTYuNiAG0 https://t.co/GBStnbIWwQ
All smiles with my dear friend and publicist @JDS_PR ❤️ https://t.co/v6F7PW6iJt https://t.co/CPMf6gnsqR
Thank you to all the brave men and women who give so much protecting our freedom... https://t.co/nojZcvZJFe #MemorialDay https://t.co/cSUSdPCqXv
Yesterday I co-hosted a benefit for the @FarrahFawcettFN at @BarneysNY in #BeverlyHills with Patrick Foley, @AlanaKStewart &amp; Linda Caan! https://t.co/LLqIaCZxNd https://t.co/AdnwxZXgM7
Thank you all for the questions! Had a great chat today 💖 What type of topics would you like to see in the future?
@TuckerPeterson_ @AlanaKStewart @FarrahFawcettFN @BarneysNY She really is 💖
@drinaldioficial It's too many words for Twitter, but keep an eye out for the book ;)
@HillsNikki Some of them in Hawaii...like the second season opener. It was fun, it was really fun. We missed Farrah,  but Hawaii was our first big location. Great memories. In terms of hair and makeup, less is more. There were no wigs or excessive makeup, maybe a little too much blush...LOL!
@TuckerPeterson_ I gave my dear friend @AlanaKStewart a sweater for her birthday when I saw her last night for a @FarrahFawcettFN event at @BarneysNY in Beverly Hills 💖
@TxSaCmo64 My favorites are the ones that help with breast cancer (I survived it and am passionate about helping as many of those affected that I can), heart health and disabled children. I support charities that make real differences in people's lives!
@angelapedroza54 #Christmas by far!
@BatHollywood You know what...I'm really not sure.
@MetalFanInBlack #ElvisPreseley and the audience went WILD...running up on stage throwing things. It was amazing.
@SouthsideNinja1 It was one of my last memories with her. She came over with her homemade German Chocolate Cake, we talked and laughed. Her outlook was inspiring, she never gave up and I still miss her so much.
@ponytailpops1 So true! Family is the best part of my life 💖
@georgehogan1 Absolutely! Both @kimbasinger and @RealJamesWoods really stood out to me. I think they both did alright ;)
@greatwoodlife I have a lot of family throughout Text and I went to highschool in Houston, loved every minute of it.
@RanchRescue Sounds like a GREAT time!
@gorsey No I can't say that I do LOL
@d60art Hello David!
@TheAssociate69 I met with her in prison, in doing so I saw how unfair her punishment was in comparison to her male counterparts. I also read up extensively on women suffering abuse. I felt so sorry for her, not being able to raise her own baby, even though what she did was wrong.
@Mariska10101 I know you will ace it 💖
@claudia_mutti It's 100% Texas, where I'm from :)
@WyAttDoRiAn She call me Mimi 💖 The sun is shining every day in this house when she comes in. PURE JOY! She's changed our lives in the best possible way.
@tatantatan My line is also available at @Sears. Do they have a location near you?
@kellyrotefla Not at the moment, but that could change ;) keep checking in here and on my Facebook page for updates on my upcoming appearances.
@trialbillyjack I would if the timing is right, my family is my biggest priority.
@faithn99 @totomarley thank you both so much for the kind Tweet! I use my own skincare line to nourish my skin, I eat well, stay active and do my best to keep a positive outlook on life.
@JChergi I don't want to do anything that defames God or my faith. I am also opposed to participating in projects that depict child abuse or torture.
@goateecowboy @LDSchurch you know what, I don't have any. I love reminiscing with people about #CharliesAngels, and everyone really does have a different question.
@BobbyRo91314736 Thank you 💖
@wvpirate No, she didn't work that day so we didn't see each other shooting The Rookies. I did meet her before Charlie's Angels though, not sure if it was at a party or a commercial.
@LJGaeke I wear my own clothing line, and although I don't make workout clothes I would love to do it with my daughter. She's a certified yoga instructor and really understands the best fabrics and fits.
@tatantatan I'm online now 💖
@danielskipsey We all had such an amazing connection that there were never any arguments. Sure we disagreed from time to time, but we always worked it out.
@AuthorDaveSeow Would love to, I was on my way there with my husband, but my daughter had an accident in gymnastics so I came home to make sure she was OK. I will definitely make it there one day.
@officialgerard Gaston is named after my grandfather, who I was so close to and Margaret is my mother's name while Spencer comes from her father's side 💖
@tracyenns_tle Not yet, I'm waiting to take the whole family. So we need Bea to get a little older so she can get her shots. It's still on the books ;)
@tinydancermj I use the day cream from my own skincare products that give coverage for UVA AND UVB protection. To protect your skin you always need to have coverage from both.
@BerzyPeter Thank you!
@Ken76997252 I do too! Always looking for the next project. When I find it I will update everyone via social :)
@Hystirycal You're so sweet ;)
@KarbonikAnne I will definitely check it out.
@waitus48 This makes me so happy! The best part of designing is being able to make other women feel great!!
@Neilrainey I can't think of any bad things...It was an incredible life-changing experience that I will cherish for the rest of my life :)
My chat starts now! Send all of your questions with #AskJaclyn 💖 What's everyone doing for the long weekend?
My next chat starts in about 20 minutes! Keep sending me your questions with #AskJaclyn ❤️

@JohnJYork So much fun, it really was a pleasure!
@Neilrainey It's ok, you can still send me questions and I will try to get to them during the chat if not before ;)
Had a great time shooting Lifestyle Magazine today! I will share the air date with you once it’s announced. https://t.co/6B9HLQ8FLo https://t.co/kx4t9Hud9a

Thank you all so much for chatting with me. What should our topic be for the next #AskJaclyn chat?
@jaymesleonard More than I could ever list. We loved so many of the same things, and we were always smiling and laughing.
@loriloriCM I'm sure she will be a beautiful bridesmaid ;)
@My_Solo_Life How about a tweet for now. Thank you for sweet tweet 💖
@Jennifer_delora @pierce_kelli ok!
@Mariska10101 I bet it would be a lot of fun.
@PrincessKellie8 Absolutely! Keep checking in for my next scheduled appearances.
@taybaby_45 @RealCherylLadd Incredible! So happy that you enjoyed it and you can always watch it again 💖 #CharliesAngels
@Superman_33 I always posts my scheduled appearances here on social media, but if you would like me to come to your city I would reach out to @Sears and @Kmart, I do a lot of appearances with them.
@elainer65 I just expanded into @Sears. So now you can find my line in both @Kmart and @Sears, both in-store and online ;)
@philriding160 Thank you for your kind words.
@claudia_mutti I loved it and I will always miss that show #CharliesAngels
@Jennifer_delora @pierce_kelli I LOVE IT!! Send a pic when you've got your hat on ;)
@digimaw Thank you! I actually have one son, one daughter and my granddaughter Bea (my daughters little girl).
@RMS_78 Happy [early] birthday!
@pierce_kelli She is so beautiful!
@trialbillyjack My home, right where I am, surrounded by all the people and things I love. Home to me is family, safety..it's my place to be myself.
@JdWooten2 Fun. She was always fun, we shared so many loves: family, decorating...art! So much!! We had so many laughs together, down to the very end. We laughed. #CharliesAngels
@Neilrainey I'm wonderful and I have met Prince Charles! Will you be watching the wedding?
Still have time for a few more questions before we wrap up. Thank you all for the sweet notes and thoughtful questions 💖 #AskJaclyn
@drinaldioficial I don't recall saying that, but I am trying to think of which dress it could be. Do you remember where you heard this?
@Akittenatheart I kept the beaded dress for the #CharliesAngels cover of @TIME. Haven't really kept props, but photos and notes are really what I cherish most.
@loriloriCM Let me know when you need me.
@SouthsideNinja1 💖
@JoeyvondoomJoe What a compliment! Thank you Joey.
@Stan_Stinson Sounds about right to me 💖
@Mariska10101 What a sweet message. Thank you so much and best of luck on your exam.
@mnu160 Thank you for the tweet!
@dannewitt1 Thank you so much!
@alsamryka Have you checked out my line @Sears and @Kmart? I design to help women find beautiful and affordable clothes that can easily transition between work and personal. Check out their websites, my lines are available online.
@KarbonikAnne No plans at the moment, bu I always share my scheduled appearances on social media. So keep checking in :) I'm not sure when the article will be in print, but you can read the article: https://t.co/bz4Pnmr9zm
@angelapedroza54 I live an active lifestyle and love doing pilates. For skincare I use my own line, you can check it out here: https://t.co/q0tXJF9GOR
@loriloriCM Thank you for all the support over the years! Being that I haven't done a lot of guest appearances, The District is definitely one of my favorites. It was a great team! I did several shows for Becker which was also a lot of fun.
@SouthsideNinja1 I'm great! I love and unstructured day with my family, antique fairs, interior design. I also always am looking at scripts so stay tuned for my next project and don't worry about the hashtag ;)
@Nance_Walker My pleasure! I usually mix my own with vanilla and musk and when I can't find my regular oils I get Cuir Beluga by @Guerlain.
@m589_marlene Thank you so much!
@cristiana2c Yes many times! I love the food, the people...the fashion!!!
@Stan_Stinson Thank you! She's the most beautiful girl in the world. I'm having the time of my life!!
@1013scullaaysha Always on the lookout for the next great script ;)
@BerzyPeter thank you!
@gorsey I wanted to cut grass as a little girl, but my parents woudn't let me.
Who else is excited for the Royal Wedding? Will you be watching? #AskJaclyn
@brettsol Yes I have! I had a mattress line that I launched over there. I loved everything, the people, the architecture...the feeling! I hope to visit again.
@mrsoglesby56 Definitely! I love romance, I love weddings and I love history...This is right up my alley.
@RMS_78 It's a very special time to me because of #CharliesAngels, it changed my life.
@BerzyPeter I'm wonderful thank you so much and may God bless yours as well.
@1chris_jones Thank you and I would share a quote from my mom, "pretty is as pretty does." I'm sure you're beautiful to everyone who cares about you.
@Przyjaciele123 Most of my products are available for sale online, but they currently aren't available for sale in retail internationally.
@Nance_Walker I mix one special for my husband out of vanilla, musk, heliotrope. I also buy him Silver Mountain Water by Creet.
@georgeginis Always looking for the right roles, all it takes is the right script.
@damaclachlan Means the world to me! I would love to see it. Can you Tweet it to me?
@TxSaCmo64 Thank you so much! I work with @PaulaYoungWigs and @Fabricut.
@Stan_Stinson I certainly do remember!! You both were absolutely lovely, how could I forget? Do you mind if I repost this photo?
@JChergi Yes I was, but I couldn't take it because of commitments with #CharliesAngels.
@KunkleCom I sure do. I love #CharliesAngels
@potterlili10 You're English is wonderful! Thank you for tweeting me &lt;3
@d60art Hello David!
@SLBG50 I think always a classic white shirt or trousers in khaki or green, or for something more feminine like a light dress or caftans. Also try adding sandals. Hope that helps!
@drinaldioficial Yes, you couldn't work for a more generous man than Aaron Spelling #CharliesAngels
@digimaw I do love to travel! Keep checking in with me to see where I'm heading next.
I'm online now! Tweet me your questions with #AskJaclyn ;)
So excited to chat with all of you! My live chat starts in 5 minutes. Tweet me your questions with #AskJaclyn ❤️

@RMS_78 Of course. We launched the show together. There was a bond that was irreplaceble. #AskJaclyn
@Neilrainey I am, but spend most of my time focusing on my other work. However, I always keep an eye open for the right script 😉
@MetalFanInBlack maintain a strong work ethic and listen to your intuition. If something feels wrong then don’t do it. #AskJaclyn
@DYoffee ...One of my favorite memories of Farrah was when she brought me her homemade chocolate cake ❤️ #AskJaclyn
@DYoffee Absolutely we were close friends. As Texas girls, we shared a lot of the same interests... #AskJaclyn
@jamesbondfan205 we do when we can ❤️ #AskJaclyn
@azrodriguez1 @RealCherylLadd yes, if the script is right I would love that! #AskJaclyn
@gorsey LOL...is this a trick? I would have to say this one 🤣

@ivkidcody Oh no!! I have so many favorites, but I will always love "Angels in Chains" #AskJaclyn
@muzikscribe Wow...thank you Todd.This message means the world to me, I am so sorry for your loss but I can't thank you enough for sharing this story with me, I am absolutely touched. #AskJaclyn
@StephaniePaser1 It introduced #CharliesAngels to a new audience while giving long time fans a new connection to the past. I loved it and I loved being Kelley Garret again. At first I wasn't sure I wanted to do it, when I got to the set @DrBarrymore made me feel right at home. #AskJaclyn
@IsobelAura That's a hard question, because I love anything from Texas and Dynasty was Aaron Spelling's show...I had friends on both, the bottom line is they were both bigger than life, total escapism. #AskJaclyn
@JohnEmerson63 I was not, but I actually have a long flight today so I will make sure to see what I can find. I would love to see what people have created. Do you have any favorites I should watch first? #AskJaclyn
@HillPlaceBlog It's been about four years since I've seen Tanya, but several since I've seen Shelley. It's time for a reunion. #AskJaclyn
@rayg2068 There have been two features made since the show, both were produced by @drewbarrymore and Lin Goldberd. I made an appearance in the second film ;) #AskJaclyn
@greatwoodlife I have so many favorites, but I just finished @TheCrownNetflix so Claire Foy is the first to come to mind. I was so sad when I ran out of episodes! #AskJaclyn
@IsobelAura Absolutely! Either I connect with the character or I don't, but I always approach new roles with excitement. #AskJaclyn
@SLBG50 I use a moisturizing shampoo &amp; condition my hair when I wash it, which varies depending on if I'm working or not. I use a heat cap (or a hot towel) monthly with a deep conditioner on it (like olive or coconut oil). Vinegar can help to remove buildup from your hair. #AskJaclyn
@GianlucaPeluzzi There are too many to name in one tweet &lt;3 #AskJaclyn
@IsobelAura Yes to everything, I love dream although I don't always. How about you? #AskJaclyn
@RMS_78 Yes I do! I got a complete set when @Sony bought the rights to the show, but I already had a copy ;) Do you have a copy? #AskJaclyn
@SLBG50 I would have to say loyalty. #AskJaclyn
@jordanthomas80 There are so many episodes that are special to me, but if I had to pick one it would be "Angels in Chains" and my favorite TV role was when I played Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, a woman who I truly admire. #AskJaclyn
@Brad44655166 I just spoke with @RealCherylLadd yesterday and hopefully I will be heading to Texas to see her soon. I also recently spoke with #KateJackson, as she's in town. We all do our best to stay in touch often. #AskJaclyn
@Mariska10101 Thank you so much! Here is a sneak peek at my new profile pic that I'm posting later today ;) #AskJaclyn https://t.co/lNd5lIDnUW
@jusblabbin Thank you and you too! #AskJaclyn
@5tasxandthecity Best to you as well! I love Argentina, such a beautiful country. #AskJaclyn
@BerzyPeter I doing well and I hope you are too! #AskJaclyn
@BatHollywood Good morning! #AskJaclyn
@JenniferKeilho1 @RealCherylLadd @KateJacksonfan Isn't she sweet!! Thank you for sharing this &lt;3
I'm online now! Tweet me your questions with #AskJaclyn!!
Good morning everyone! I will be online this in about 20 minutes at 10am PST (1pm EST). Tweet me your questions with #AskJaclyn. Chat soon!!
Function and style. These sunglasses are in stores and online now at @Kmart + @Sears! https://t.co/RlCA04D9XT https://t.co/q1XDyEnH2s
Thrilled to be in San Francisco meeting with the design team for @Kmart and @Sears to review... https://t.co/yRuilHbqEC https://t.co/ozarYvjygU
Thank you to everyone who came out to support @AbilityFirstLA's Stroll &amp; Roll last Sunday. It was very a special day with family and friends by my side. I feel very blessed. https://t.co/rLIJzkbXTv https://t.co/wQRWk5c3k6
@RMS_78 It would have been a challenge, but I would have loved it! How cool would that have been? We all supported each other and maybe we would have gotten to do more of what we wanted, that never made its way into the show. Who knows?
@Ynot_t For me it's less about a specific person, I would want it to feel authentic...someone who will really understands me and what's been important to me throughout my life...most of you know that's always been family for me ;)
@sarverpa Little Grace is thriving. She is such a good natured dog. She waits for her treats and loves everyone who comes into the house. So healthy, both physically and mentally.
@SouthsideNinja1 I don't have any trips scheduled yet, but we are working on scheduling store appearances for @Kmart and @Sears...would love to come visit Florida!
@mercede68152389 I just recently expanded into @Sears both in-store and online! I'm thrilled about it :)
@gorsey Polishing silver...I just can get lost in it!
@timwfortenberry I miss everything...how much time do you have? I could never narrow it done. It's always going to be home, it's a part of every breath I take.
@TheSupremeNo2 I love seeing female directors bring their talents to the table. I want to see this as an open field for whoever is talented, not whether they are male or female.
@MetalFanInBlack I loved "I Love Lucy" and "Father Knows Best" and I really loved watching Dragnet with the family, it brought us together. It was so fun for us all to try and solve the mystery!
@JaclynSmithFan Already done! Thank you for coming out to @Sears.
@0773heidi I love the memory shows, which were compilations of our favorite moments. I'm sentimental so those always stood out to me, showing how the relationships and storylines developed over the years.
@kim_kizzo I love pizza, burgers...Mexican food! We are lucky to have someone here at the house who makes amazing enchiladas! Antiquing, Pilates (every day) and renovating homes are all hobbies...but my favorite is having free time with my granddaughter.
@Neilrainey No, but that's on my list! I would love to visit...and my husband loves golf so it would be perfect trip.
@JChergi I am in friends with her and would love to congratulate her! It's well deserved. @RealLyndaCarter
My next Twitter chat starts in about 30 minutes at 10am PST! Tweet me your questions ;)

@bchsnow Absolutely! Still waiting for the right script.
@KendraBCambra What a sweet thing to say! Thank you for the kind words :)
@lolly_johnston I take care of myself, eating well (for the most part), exercising and a quality skincare regimen. I use my own line, Jaclyn Smith Beauty. Have you ever tried it?
@outahear More love and kindness.
@kedallen Thank you so much Kevin!
@ejacobson20 I don't think I will ever stop, but I am waiting for the next script that really grabs me.
@Cali1surfer @boderek I do love antiquing in that area :)
@wkriel59 I am always open to trying new things, maybe one day!
@dansyd Any day with my mother &lt;3
@philriding160 You are so sweet.
@lizblessedlife7 Hello! I make my own mixture myself. Should I launch my own perfume?
@Judyluvspeace I sure hope so! We received so much love and support, I still feel very blessed.
@BerzyPeter You are so welcome!!
@Lawal5Sarah I really loved playing Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy.
@tripprogers Absolutely! We have such a strong and unique bond from our shared experiences.
@BrianSLSpringer My favorite thing to do will always be spending time with my family who I love dearly. In terms of fame, it was definitely an adjustment, but I have been very blessed with such incredible supportive fans.
@Ken76997252 I always have my eye out for the right script...stay tuned.
@LeesaSawyer13 No worries Leesa, send in questions when you can and I will do my best to get back to you.
@rayraynic1 Me too!
@kramkardam @KarlJSchmid @ABC7 @abc7george Well Mark I am flattered...I think ;)
@sarverpa I just like to connect with all of you. Is there anything you would like to chat about?
@dugsr1 We have talked about it, but will have to wait and see.
@JohnEmerson63 I LOVE @tcm! The Golden Age of Hollywood was always a source of inspiration. So many strong women, with so much talent.
@McgillGma Absolutely, we have such a special bond.
@let876 I am trying to get started on a book, I really want to write down the stories about my family to share with my children and little Bea. I am also always looking for the right script, I will keep you all posted when I find my next project.
@Mark26160889 It's so hard to choose, there are special moments to me in every year of my life. Did you have a favorite?
@kedallen I find inspiration all around me, my goal is always to make clothes that make you feel good when you wear them without a hefty price.
@rayraynic1 Thank you!! A little late, but I hope you had a great start to the week.
@LindaWa88262545 @let876 I guess we will have to wait and see what happens... :)
@LindaWa88262545 @MABrownStuff Thank you!!
@LindaWa88262545 I do! My line is available at @kmart and @sears (in store and online).
@gorsey No, I am back again. I have been trying to make time every week to connect with all of you.
Hi everyone!! I'm here, keep sending questions I'm going to start answering right now ;)
I'm doing another LIVE chat on Wednesday at 10am PST! Tweet me your questions ;)
@KaciWhitby An American in Paris! I loved it so much that I saw it two more times, once in LA and once in San Francisco. My best friend's Polly Baird performed in it as a dancer! She was incredible. So talented!
@DrCristianLeite I feel very grateful. My collection has been in @Kmart for 33 years and we just launched in @Sears last Thursday. In terms of projects I am always looking and when there's a good script I go for it ;)
@karen_nace I loved playing Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy because I respect and admire  her so much. I had an incredible childhood, full of so many precious  memories with the best family there ever was.
@BlueIsMyFav12 Rage of Angels was one of my favorites! Thank you :) and yes we keep in touch, we're very close friends.
@MABrownStuff It's different every day, but today was extra special because I knew my granddaughter Bea was coming over so I was over the moon.
@IsobelAura I wanted to be a ballerina :)
@Gogoro7 Thank you for coming to see me! So nice to meet you. I already have another collection in the works for fall @sears.
@IsobelAura It's something I am planning to do and I am positive I would feel a connection. In fact I there is a grove of trees that were planted there in memory of my mother, one day I will visit it.
@Cali1surfer I always all over the place in Southern California and I love that area. It's great for antiquing.
@Akittenatheart I am trying to work on a book now. It really comes down to finding the time. In terms of fragrances I am definitely ready and set on what it is...so stay tuned. It would be a great addition to my skincare line.
@statenisland65 Now that I'm in @Sears that may be possible. It is something I would love to do.
@lugosiwashere I am an actress first. My acting world opened up the business part of my life, which gave me the opportunity to give back by creating beautiful affordable clothes.
@JackieMcQuade I love several authors, but my favorite is Pat Conroy. Beach Music and Prince of Tides are two of my favorites.
@LiunaticFringe It's available now! I am glad you love it, it's a very versatile piece. You can wear long after spring and it's available in stores and online now at @sears &lt;3
@MsGasometer @RealCherylLadd The show changed our lives and the friendship we developed will always hold a special place in all of our hearts. We have a common bond because we were there together.
@TheRealVinBeck1 I really am open to either. For me what's important is the script, otherwise I focus my time on my business.
@let876 I would be open to it, but it depends on the script and the cast.
@WyAttDoRiAn There's not just one thing...I would say eat right, exercise, live right, always make time to connect with people who you love and be good to yourself.
@MetalFanInBlack Now that I am watching @NBCThisisUs I would have to say @MiloVentimiglia. His character's love and devotion to family is inspiring and he's easy on the eyes ;)
@BerzyPeter @RealRomaDowney @KTLAMorningNews @KTLA Thank you!
I am ordering two copies of @ScottHamilton84's book for my kids and it was a pleasure meeting him. He was a delight in every way! https://t.co/iH1g38r84L
@ScottHamilton84 @accessonline it was a pleasure meeting you too!!
@DaynaDevon @JimmyHens thank you!
@jhbonline @ScottHamilton84 @accessonline I love this!
@BrendaDiazcruz4 @ScottHamilton84 @accessonline thank you!
@rayraynic1 One of my favorites too!!
I am online now taking your questions LIVE! Tweet me now ;)
Look who I found @KTLA this morning!! Tune in at 9:30am to see me live. https://t.co/cRO1pA06uq
Join me for an exciting announcement and personal meet-and-greet at @Sears located in @DelAmoFashion in #Torrance! Get the details and learn how you can get a FREE $10 Sears gift card by visiting: https://t.co/9wA4WhLIK3 https://t.co/uXGhDNfVpR
I always have so much fun chatting with you all! Check back in for updates on my next chat. Let me know what you want to discuss 😉
@BrianSLSpringer Broadway is where I began and I am always open to going back. For me it’s always about the script, I never say never.
@barrman hi Larry!
@RMS_78 he was a true professional. So involved in the script, he wanted to make sure everything was right. I really admired his work ethic.
Thank you all for your questions! I will take a couple more and then we can continue again next week.
@HannibalChris that was the beginning of my career, I have been blessed to work in and out of Hollywood ever since.
@mrsoglesby56 taking my family on a Safari in Africa, but I want to wait until Bea is a little older.
@brendachrist @Kmart 33 wonderful years! I’m so fortunate to have been surrounded by great people who have helped me along the way!
@rayraynic1 I’m still coping, but I’m lucky in that I see them frequently. Please thank your daughter f/her service. You must be very proud.
@alygirl_7 I love Christmas so I was able to really have a lot of fun with this. I can’t wait to watch it with her ❤️
@paddyc2 So glad to hear that, I love it too! Another favorite of mine is my day cream because it's like three creams in one and you can even apply it over makeup.
@statenisland65 Yes! I have done it many times; calls, dinners, lunches. I love connecting with people.
@FindlayDuff Training and hard work are the foundation for success; find a teacher/mentor who you really connect with, join an improv group and never stop honing your craft.
@crinklecutchips Hello from California! Exercise has always been an important part of my routine, I have really been enjoying Pilates lately. Fun fact...did you know it was originally started to help rehabilitate injured soldiers?
@cabranes19 Hi from Beverly Hills ;)
@BBKGLFAN No I did not, that would have been fun for my son to have though ;)
@AlisonGrimwood Thank you so much.
@Respectanimals1 I love prints and I love basics, but if I could only have one thing in my closet it would be a crisp white cotton shirt because it is one of the most versatile garments. You can dress is up or down.
@timwfortenberry I love them! I have them in my home. Remember this, there are no rules, except for this: it has to bring you joy.
@statenisland65 Thank you! Bridal Wave was a great cast. I am always looking for the right script. Keep checking in and I will let you know when I find it ;)
@LJGaeke I have no plans to leave @kmart and if you don't have one in your area you can always shop online: https://t.co/rwgreB3aw3
@MartinePirozzi Losing my mother.
@AJLuna She had the best sense of humor and always shared in the love and celebration as her loved ones achieved success.
@SLBG50 First person to come to mind is: @Pontifex
@kathyparman Yes, I've started that process and am actively working on it. It's a link to my past that I want to share as a legacy for my children and granddaughter.
@Rolyma First you are right on about my granddaughter. She is really the light of my life. I would love to work with Kate again. For me it's all about the script, it has to be the right project. In the mean time it's all about my brand and developing new products.
@SouthsideNinja1 I'm doing well! How about you? I think the funniest/best part was all the practical jokes we would play on each other. When you're working 18 hours it helps to have some comic relief. For instance...David collected candy bars and we would always sneak in and take them.
@KaciWhitby I love happy endings and Ordinary Miracles really delivered on that. I am all about staying positive and Family Album was wonderful, I love how it showed the complexity of family over time.
@statenisland65 Absolutely! To request one simply email contact@jaclynsmith.com.
@TuckerPeterson_ You are asking the wrong person...I love bread too! As a child I could eat 10 pieces of oven toast and I don't eat breakfast without bread.
@aarconv Yes! Check back with me in March for big news.
@bandt001 Absolutely not! I have been taught by the best.
@DiddleFruit Aren't you the sweetest! Thank you so much.
@BerzyPeter I'm well thank you for asking :)
@ManizalsDiego Hi Diego! No plans right now, but keep checking in with me for updates.
Let's get this party started! So excited to chat with you all again. I'm online so tweet me your questions.
My chat starts in 10 minutes!! Excited to chat food, fashion, business, family...you name it. Talk soon ❤️
Who’s joining my LIVE chat today? Join me in 30+ minutes at 10am PT, but feel free to tweet me your questions now 😉 see you soon!
"Believe you can and you're halfway there" #TheodoreRoosevelt https://t.co/cKkv4KOrH8 https://t.co/ErFju1jrfb
My next live chat is this Wednesday at 10am Pacific! Tweet me your questions. Love chatting about design, food, my work and family! Hope to see you then.
Another peek at our photo shoot. Here’s my ‘Malibu Waves’ wig. You’ll  love the layers of soft beachy waves and a sheer lace front for  off-the-face styling. Use code JACLYN for a free shipping offer on all  my wigs. Shop here: https://t.co/8aViMLTA5G https://t.co/6hd5aRk7Fr
Thank you all for joining my chat! Stay tuned for the next chat. Sorry  if I missed your question, I will keep trying to catch up on all them.  Feel free to keep sending them :)
@RMS_78 I have not watched many soap operas, I am more into mini-series like @TheCrownNetflix and #Victoria!
@SueEllenRossi You know I love Danielle Steel and Kaleidoscope was one of her novels. I am huge fan of Toronto, very cosmopolitan. So clean and beautiful! Wonderful restaurants and shopping, I was right at home.
@rdonlyforus @lifetimetv @hallmarkchannel Thank you so much! What a wonderful compliment. I loved them too and am always on the lookout for my next project, so stay tuned.
@Ynot_t I would love to do it, but it would have to be the right script.
@EaglesA01 thank you :)
@officialgerard Absolutely! It's easier than running a house ;)
@angelapedroza54 I did have my own fragrance that I created with @MaxFactorUK called California and it won "Fragrance of the Year." I currently mix my own and would love to create a new one!
@johnftlaud It's a tie between my granddaughter Bea's room &amp; the loft above my bedroom. Bea's room because if I'm in there it means I am with her and there are so many memories in that room of my daughter too! The loft is a special place where I keep some of my most sentimental belongings ;)
@Lacey2968 I have bedding and linens right now in @Kmart and we are currently in talks about towels, dishes and more home accessories.
@alygirl_7 Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, since she was so well known I couldn't take creative liberties as an actress. She was so special that I felt a responsibility to capture her essence with as much authenticity as possible.
@chocolotto12 Gone With The Wind, Roman Holiday and La La Land are some of my favorites.
@sdyogi8 Always looking, but it has to be something extra special for us to do it together.
@scottwrynn Our farm in Luling, Texas is always going to be the most magical place to me. It has the San Marcos River running through it. I am so happy I was able to share it with my children when they were small.
@cfc100 @Fabricut__ Great seeing you!!! I thought it was a great meeting and I'm so glad you loved it!
@johnwilliamlaw If I had to stick with one it would the gummi bears from @DylansCandyBar.
@StephaniePaser1 Settle the Score was a difficult movie to make because of the subject matter. I loved the way it challenged me as an actress because it was such a departure from anything I had done up to that point.
@FindlayDuff Hi Findlay!
@johnftlaud The best is, it's about work. I find work fulfilling and it brings out my creativity which makes me the happiest. The worst part can be the lack of privacy, and when rumors get printed as facts when they are not.
@KaciWhitby Just tweet me your question and I will do my best to respond ;)
@GlynetteSimoes It all starts with what makes you happy and what you love to look at. This can range from painting a room a fantastic color to lighting your favorite candles or even adding fresh cut flowers. Just remember that comfort is key!
@tinydancermj Well first of all on Charlie's I did not get to work with John because he was the voice. However, I got to work with him on The Users, and he was exactly what you would expect him to be the perfect gentlemen. Did you know The Users was a best selling novel?
@JudyFStanley That's a constant discussion. Our plus sizes have been very successful and I believe that petites would also be successful. Stay tuned ;)
@raymondkenny2 It was so nice to meet you. This was taken on a trip to New York and and, if I'm right this was taken at the New York Stock Exchange...if I'm wrong it was a very long day lol
@SHIELD909 perfect timing ;)
@Powell_DA I think since we are still talking about it 40+ years later I wouldn't change much. I really would want to hold onto the innocence of the show so it could act as an escape for all the dark and intense shows that have flooded the market.
@SVU_Diehards ...they were all so great, made me feel so welcome!
@SVU_Diehards Ann Margret and @morgfair were also on the episode, we didn't have any scenes together but I did get to see Ann Margret on set -- I had not done a lot of episodic shooting since my show and it really is another mindset to go back into show that's been on the air for 11 years.
Hi everyone! I am online and taking your questions now!!
I will be online in about an hour at 4pm PT!! Chat soon and don't forget to Tweet me your questions.
We can chat everything! From interior design, to fashion, to Hollywood...Tweet me your questions and I will be online answering them at 4pm (Pacific) today.
Chat with me! Tweet me your questions and I will be on LIVE today at 4pm PT!
My heart breaks for everyone affected by the tragedy in Florida. I'm sending love and prayers to you all during this difficult time.
Brad surprised me with these beautiful roses last night before dinner. Hope your Valentine's Day was special. https://t.co/acb0S5DYKz https://t.co/Ti0FIlF4D0
My parents, true sweethearts, married for over 50 years! Happy Valentines Day ❤️ https://t.co/EWZv0vcW3H https://t.co/697wtoruO4
Thank you all for chatting with me! Talk to you soon on my next chat.
@sunshinesmama39 Thank you so much! The memory shows were always fun, they would edit different clips together into a story...there are too many to list. In terms of beauty, I don't drink and I don't smoke...eat well...work out and take of your skin.
@Tiswas_Tony Yes, it's lived up to every dream I've had. Being a mother and an actress has allowed me to be ever present in my children's lives. I feel very fortunate, very grateful.
@PScottStJames No but stay tuned for me.
@Nema1963 I had a chance to do James Bond, but I couldn't do it because we were still shooting Charlie's Angles. I had a commitment and I don't take those lightly.
@campbellm65 I would say Jaclyn Boiuvier Kenedy and Rage of Angles (1 and 2).
@MAS1244 He was genuine. He was funny...and you're right he was the safe place for all the girls. I miss him, he was a great guy.
@deecee1964 I'm completely involved...from fit, to identify color trends, even down to where the buttons are placed. It's not just my name, these pieces are designed by me. My biggest influence is my mother who always wanted to be a fashion designer.
@LJGaeke Not since I lost my parents. However, I do go to visit my brother in New Braunfels.
@d60art No, but I was at a luncheon in Houston where she was. I saw her as a college student, though I never actually met her.
@6string_groove I wouldn't know about Pedialyte, I've never had a hangover. I will pass that knowledge on to some friends. My favorite food is a cross between Italian &amp; American. I'm never giving up my pizza and hamburgers.
@loriloriCM I never say never, there is nothing in the works now. It could be fun though if the script is right.
@RMS_78 Many many many! Oh gosh, you know so many people come to mind. It's a list that's too long for Twitter. I just won't fit in these few characters.
@SammydWilliams My family is my biggest joy, achievement...but in work it's that I am still working. I have moved from movies to business and let me tell you. Running a business is much more challenging than doing a movie.
@alliefeld16 No, but thank you for writing!
@MikeMongillo I am!
@Emmylou71 It was my mother &lt;3
@JhEire Definitely moisturize day and night. Reapply your moisturizer, even over makeup. I love my line of skincare: https://t.co/q0tXJF9GOR -- make sure you're using a moisturizer with Retinol in it.
@WhileTurning @tcm No I haven't, but I love @tcm and I watch it all the time.
@Batallante There is some talk about it. It takes a lot of time, it may take me several years. I would like to do it for my granddaughter.
@MLR1515 Didn't see your original question ;)
@jao64o Yeah, I think it's a winning concept. If it's cast right and you stick with the foundation: the relationship of three strong women.
@timwfortenberry My favorite color is green. My favorite perfume is one I mix, it has vanilla, musk, a little floral. I love powdering old fashioned scents.
@drinaldioficial @Kmart Thank you for the support and shopping at my favorite store @Kmart. Stay tuned for updates on my next roles.
@tonymelchiore It's available now here: https://t.co/q0tXJF9GOR -- and thank you! I'm glad you liked it, I created the scent from my favorites, vanilla, musk...the good stuff!
@drinaldioficial No, I actually went on a medical meeting with my husband. He is a pediatric heart surgeon, I was just along for the ride. Argentina is such a beautiful and diverse country, I was thrilled to experience it.
@sanab1965 It was a very happy time in my life. My mother and father got to see the fruits of that series. There was so much in the friendship with the girls. Our lives changed, and they changed together.
@MetalFanInBlack Well if you are following the rules it is not real wine. I always hope for a cast that follows the rules, so no one gets out of control ;)
@marthc1983 Absolutely! If I love it, I do it. I sometimes have to turn things down due to scheduling, but I am always open to the right part.
@TYork1020 There are many I love, but Jaclyn Boiuvier Kenedy is my favorite movie. I have always admired her and it was a an honor to play her.
@steve45220 In producing it would be a financial situation, you have your heart set on a certain director, but there's not enough money in the budget to get them. It's making the compromise that's most challenging.
@GlynetteSimoes I am surrounded with very loving, kind and supportive people. My family. Light attracts light, I'm a lucky girl.
@LeifIsager Talking to you while my dogs are looking at me lovingly.
@TooCloseToTheTV If you want a real good rendition of that night Google "Conan O'Brien 2006 Emmys."
@Respectanimals1 Today I love @coldplay. I also have loved @thebeatles and @AndreaBocelli....and MANY more!
@princvssjeia Oh god...it is too hard to pick. The outfits were designed by Oleg Cassini and they were just incredible. I do love the red suit I wore for the tour of The White House.
@tonymelchiore Yes! Absolutely!! I am in select @Sears locations and available now: https://t.co/NOjDySdl8l
@lizblessedlife7 Sounds enticing! Wish I was coming, but don't have any plans as of yet.
@angelapedroza54 If a @Kmart has closed near you, there is always the website: https://t.co/I3KLL68pXt
@KarbonikAnne Yes she has a beautiful daughter named Bea and her father is Fran Kranz.
@AJLuna I've been very lucky to have had mostly positive experiences. I have had a few stories not based on fact printed, it bothers me because I am a woman of truth... No I have never worked with him.
@wvpirate Yes I do, I love to keep up with both of them! @RealCherylLadd is living in Texas, I've seen her the most since we've recently worked together.
@Breffney As a child I was a dancer and I was always inspired by Leslie Caron. When I saw her in a movie called The Glass Slipper it made me want to dance like her. She brought Cinderella to life for me.
@Breffney I once had an opportunity to do Gene Tierney's story, but it didn't work out. I think there is something about mental illness in her story that is so relevant today and I wish I could do it!
I'm on LIVE now! Tweet me your questions ;)
I will be live tweeting today at 3pm PT! Send me your questions now. Hope to see you there!
Who's joining me tomorrow at 3pm PT for my next live chat? Start Tweeting me your questions now.
“Angels in Chains.” I remember we were always on time for a scene cause we were chained together... #FBF https://t.co/uwHaIcM4kC https://t.co/YnQbB29o1R

Today would have been Farrah’s birthday. She has been gone nine years and she is still ever present in my life! https://t.co/D8Eu6g6QoN https://t.co/MwXIAMLdAB
I can't wait to do this again! Thank you all for your questions and comments. I loved this! Join me for my next LIVE Twitter chat on 2/13 at 1pm PT (4pm ET). Hope to see you there and have a wonderful day.
@Affinity4Axl My daughter is a young mother and an excellent one...I would love for her to be here to give advice because things change with each generation and she is so plugged. The cornerstone is love, patience and NOT worrying about if you're doing it right.
@SLBG50 I am in the process of thinking about that right now...not a beauty book, but one where I share my life, all the chapters of it that brought me to where I am right now.
@Breffney My favorite is Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy because I admire her so much. Rage of Angels 1 &amp; 2. I also liked George Washington because it made history pop off the pages for young people...and that was an 8-hour miniseries!
Thank you all for your questions and this has been so much fun! I will answer a few more questions, but we will definitely do this again soon!
@CharliesAngelsR It is in the works, we are having a design meeting tomorrow so stay tuned for an update.
@LaurieFrey Healthy living is important. I don't drink, I don't smoke. Surround yourself with people you love, and when it comes to diet eat well but a treat here and there never hurts anyone. Moderation is key.
@ElphabaLondon Loyal, devoted, traditional :)
@ladyleesal @Kmart Making women feel beautiful. I design for real women, leading real lives. I want women to have access to affordable clothes that are on trend. Affordable doesn't have to mean out of style!
@angelapedroza54 She was such a young girl, a popular actress! I remember her being very fun and that she loved Charlie's Angels. She was a true fan &lt;3
@ElphabaLondon I don't think at the time they realized that it would be a family show that appealed to all ages. The range took it from a show for adults, to a show for everyone.
@Respectanimals1 Hi Kirlee and Batman I love your names!! You're both adorable. I wish you could meet Elizabeth, Grace and Honeybun.
@Dina9592 There are certain roles I "should have" taken, but it was always for a good reason. Whenever I turned down a role, it was because family has always come first.
@rayraynic1 So great to hear from you! Glad you love the sweaters! At Christmas we have so many traditions! Decorating the tree and I had a stocking made for her that shares the story of her life. We all wear matching pajamas on Christmas eve, even the dogs!
@Affinity4Axl I am spiritual, I am a faith-based person. My grandfather was a Methodist Minister, and I believe I am going to see all my loved ones again, they've just gone ahead.
@Affinity4Axl I am lucky I have my own line. My husband created it by taking products I was using &amp; making them even better. I love my daytime moisturizer it has a primer, a moisturizer, UVA/UVB protection, pearl dust &amp; diamond dust (to reflect light &amp; diminish lines) https://t.co/q0tXJF9GOR
@let876 It was a fun time in my life. I loved the girls, I still love them, they were my best friends...I miss the comradery and I miss the work.
@d60art Hands down Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind!
@HelenaHyeres83 I would absolutely live the same life. I had the best parents, children, grandchild, husband, career. We all have regrets but I am incredibly grateful for the life I live.
@MeGayCaveman It wasn't easy because I was only seen as an actress, it took a lot of work. Constantly designing and traveling, but that was what I wanted to do. However, as time went on people began to see how involved I was with my brand and @kmart educated me and an entire customer base.
@Affinity4Axl Well I was really a dancer to begin with, and I was living in NY when I was approached to model...and then from there I ended up in LA acting ;)
@enriqueskincare "Angels in Chains" because it was a breakout hit. We were actually all chained together through the whole shoot! We had such a great time...did a lot of talking!
@wellendowedpaul I remember Farmingdale, I love that part of the country. Thank you for coming and thank you for remembering. It makes me feel great!!
@PaulaYoungWigs I have my dear friend @joseeberhair and we brainstorm what we both like. We just came out with a new silver starlet color that's beautiful. The goal is for it to always look like you're not wearing a wig at all.
@INFERNOKEVIN1 It feels great! My son called the Kelly doll the "mommy doll"
@Santa516 Buenos dias!
@danielskipsey My family brings me more joy and laughter than anything else!
@CharliesAngelsR I love that @Kmart location, I get holiday decorations, candies all kinds of fun stuff. It is actually the one I go to the most. Maybe I will run into you there next time you're in town?
@aarconv My fur babies are wonderful shining stars. They lower our blood pressure, they just make us happy. They are all beautiful!
@HalfBreed2010 I would wrap my hair under heat and put electric rollers in it, but it was maintained with pin curls. I actually have curly hair. Wrapping is a fun thing to do you put two rollers on the top of your head and then you wrap your hair one direction, using your hair as a roller ;)
@CharliesAngelsR I was lucky I had great leading men, but Robert Wagner was one of my favorites.
@lulu8771 Yes, I haven't in a while. We try to plan a reunion at least once every year!

Featured on Deal-Of-The-Day at http://t.co/67NajEYVZI today.
The best advice I’ve ever been given is if you spend $1 more than your budget, you’re over budget!
Shop or do your research online before you head to the stores
Don’t compete with the neighbor’s holiday decorations. Its all about what makes you and your family happy.
#Holidays can be overwhelming. Take one step at a time.
Have someone impossible to shop for? Offer to go shopping with them.
@phoenix_elvis Happy Birthday. Hv a great day!
Kmart will donate $1 to St.Jude Children's Hospital for every Bear Ornament purchased. Please RT http://t.co/uCKl3EK3WN
#DecorateItForward is a way to pay it forward and spread Christmas cheer. http://t.co/2EW7WQc8Kw
Memories are made with loved ones sharing a meal at the table, cooking and trimming the tree.
Remember the holidays are about making memories.
New ornament added to our dog's tree this year-"Merry Woofmas'. http://t.co/M8qwYwOrWm
Make a place in your home for the kids to make holiday decorations.
Make decorating one of your regular traditions. Involve your kids.
When decking the halls, remember what the holidays mean - spending time with family, friends and those you love.

I use Retinol nightly, but sometimes take a break with a non-Retinol cream.
Retinol is in my Intensive Night Cream – it’s the ‘gold standard’ of anti-aging ingredients.

@seffron999  From age 20, learn how to do a breast self-exam.  20-39 years, talk w/yr doctor abt mammograms at least every 3 yrs.
@MCJunkie Thanks for the RT. This is so important.
Men tune in too. The lifetime risk of men getting breast cancer is abt 1 in 1,000.
Tune into "The Talk" next Tue. We'll be sharing lots of good info on BC awareness.
@TownsendDavies The girls are terrific on the new Charlie's Angels.
It is estimated that more than 200 thousand women will be diagnosed w/breast cancer in 2011.
Ladies 40+, did you get your annual mammogram? If not, do it this month!
Request new catalog from Paula Young. Many 1st time buyer specials on some of my fav wigs.http://http://bit.ly/oXZTE5
@delwilliams  Thanks Del for the RT. It's so important.
Mothers, sisters, daughters, U can be part of "The Talk" in Oct and get your first mammogram. Call 818-655-8255 http://t.co/nJtmEa7h
All women 40 and over shud get annual mammo and clinical breast exam.
Live in LA? Need a mammaogram? Sign up join us on "The Talk" for Oct Breast Cancer Awareness month. http://t.co/YLHdI8dI
Fur trim on sweaters, buckles on skirts and pants give  a British Countryside feel.
Look for soft flowy skirts, slim leg pants, cable sweaters w touches of metallic.
@mitaka_88 thanks for the RTs.
Camel is key color this season.
Look for classic country colors of rusts and berrys to rich teals.
A big idea this fall is British Countryside. Country florals, paisleys, buckles and riding details.
@leonv23 Bootsie Gum Drop was a rescue. I don't know her original name.
Thanks for the #ff RT @ShiCooks: #Follow @realjaclynsmith Have a wonderful weekend! (ˆ◡ˆ) ♥
@heykim:  tks for the RT. Honey Bun, our toy poodle, rules the bed.
@heykim 1 standard poodle, 1 toy poodle, 1 cavalier king charles, 2 french bull dogs and 1 very big bed.
The girls are great. Bravo Charlie's Angels.
My first cat was a shelter cat . I named her Bootsie Gum Drops.
1 standard poodle, 1 toy poodle, 1 cavalier king charles, 2 french bull dogs and 1 very big bed.
We have 5 dogs and they all fit on our bed.
Tell your kids to be original.
Teach your kids to be kinder than usual.
Teach your children to keep their desk and work area neat. It's a good habit.
@gigisaffronever Thanks Gigi - it was a great post.
Find a skin care routine that works for you and stick to it. Consistency is key.

@beautyuc Tks Beauty Undercover for today's blog post. http://t.co/6IHQxgv
@pixies168 I also have sensitive skin and these are the products I use, but not everyone's skin is the same.
Tan and brown for accessories this Fall. Mix a chocolate brown braided belt with a cognac bag..
Look for colors like camel, caramel, toffee, cognac and rust. Great to wear as head-to-toe for a streamlined look, or mix the colors up.
Tip. It's all about the 70's for fashion this fall, inspired by Love Story, Charlie Girl, Annie Hall.
Fly Old  Glory this weekend.
Exfoliate 1-2 times week unless you have sensitive skin.  For sensitive skin every 14 days is fine.
Exfoliation removes those dead cells that make your skin look dull and drab.
Dye your eyelashes  and you won't need daily mascara.
Antioxidants found in green tea are good for your skin.

@dmbrown111 I have a great team. We work hard to offer great products and value. Tks.
Your day cream should include a sunscreen and antioxidants to protect your skin from the sun's UV rays.
We've added  diamond and pearl dust for radiance which reduces the look of fine lines & wrinkles.
@dmbrown111 Thanks for the RT.  Have you tried my skin care - what do you think?
Remember to use  cream liberally on your neck and décolletage AM and PM.
The active sun blocking agents in my day cream  gives complete UVA/UVB protection.
@TheBearGirl  Thank you. The sent of vanilla in my body lotion is just the right amount.  I'm glad you like it too.
I always apply my day creme before make-up to prep the skin.  Make-up goes on easier and looks better.
I want to share this poem with you for my friend, Devon Page McCleary. http://yfrog.com/h77maxzj

Shoes and accessories like belts and necklaces are a great for pulling together an outfit.
Wear belts a little higher on the torso to make your waistline look slimmer.
Try belting a cardigan over a dress for a polished look that works from day to night.

@StephDCottrell Thank you for the RTs.
It’s always fun to shop the end of summer sales.
Keep your summer prints handy. Wear a summer floral skirt with a tweed fitted jacket  to warm up the outfit.
It’s time to grab a few l items from the back of your closet and mix them in to your looks.
Many of this summer’s trends will carry into this fall and you don’t have to overhaul your entire closet.
Pack away your beach bag but don’t put away those summer prints.
Time to organize your closet for fall and cooler weather.
Happy first day of autumn.
Shop and BCRF gets $1 for each purchase. http://ow.ly/2HLPY
For every purchased of our 25th Anniv collection Kmart will donate $1 to Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Now thru October.
Have you seen our new ad in national fashion mags?  Tell me what you think. http://ow.ly/i/40ej
Wave to children on the school bus.
A good day cream will prep your skin and act as a base for your foundation.  Makeup will go on easier and look better.
A clean face helps maximize absorption of active ingredients in your creams.
Use a gentle milk or emulsion cleanser to remove makeup and leave you skin refreshed.
Wash your face using lukewarm water twice a day.
Follow a sound beauty routing that works for you and stick to it.
