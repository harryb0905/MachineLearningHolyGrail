Just recorded a segment on health care for Fox Chicago Sunday, be sure to tune in. A good chat with Dane Placko on an important topic!
Thanks for following this live-twitter of the call. Questions asked by callers selected at random
Judy says bill is "too much government for me." Now moving to last caller, who starts by saying she is "dead-set against this bill"
Caller worries medical decisions will be made by statistics, will lead to govt rationing.
Caller says they're trying to cut costs from top, not addressing causes of costs. Judy discusses her alternate bill that will reduce costs
Judy understands people concerned by big-government medicine. Next caller also concerned by health costs, doesn't think that this bill helps
Judy knows that a lot of elected officials do care, do listen, doesn't like some of the negativity
Caller complains that people who oppose the bill feel like they're not listened to by many elected officials, instead accused of being mobs
Poll results! Over 1000 on call, responding: 14% for bill, 69% against, 17% don't know or want more information.
Judy: Everybody concerned by cost of health care. Caller thanks Judy for doing calls, complains abt Speaker Pelosi's "unamerican" comments
Now doing a poll about whether people on the call support the House's health care bill
Judy: Illegals (9.7 million) not adressed by bill right now. 13-16 million Americans actually uninsured.
Caller says issue of uninsured illegals has never been addressed
According to today's WSJ, end of life provisions will not be included in Senate Finance cmmte's bill. Others hearing same concerns she hears
Caller concerned about seniors, end of life decisions. Judy says it's her job to make sure these concerns are heard in DC.
Number of uninsured inflated by people eligible for coverage but not signed up.
Caller cites a section of the bill as reported in today's trib; people really do know a lot about this bill.
Judy stresses the costs of the bill, surcharges will be set by a board, not by congress
Hi everyone - sorry about tweet-silence this busy week! We'll be doing a healthcare tele-townhall with seniors soon, staff will tweet it.
Also - wow! 997 followers!
Packed boxes for Operation Support Our Troops Illinois today. Also spoke to volunteers there. A great organization with a great purpose

Planning to speak on the floor soon re: health care. Watch on CSpan!
Judy discusses need for Medicare fraud reform, costs taxpayers $10+ billion per year. Has introduced bills to fight fraud. Now last question
Judy says this is an issue that needs bipartisanship, were shut out by other side.
Caller says health care is a mess,
Poll results: 59% oppose plan in Congres, 20% support, 20% don't know.
In ed-labor committee 2 wks ago, Judy offered amendment to protect employer-provided insurance but it was rejected by majority.
Caller: "very upset" by plan; reform needed but gov't control not the answer. Judy concerned people can't keep private insurance under bill.
Caller: mother of a medically fragile child. Employer-provided insurance expensive, but "worth every penny."
Caller: "climate of defensive medicine" produces high insurance premiums. Need to fix malpractice laws but not even mentioned in the bill.
[To constits: tonight's call only in DuPage Co.]
Comment from caller - gov't bureaucracy worse than private plans. Judy stresses need for reform, need to protect dr-patient relationships.
Judy polling call participants re support for House proposal. Next caller says cap on medical malpractice suits would reduce costs for all
Caller says they worked for federal govt, saw bureaucracy in action, worried about this in health care. Judy concerned: wait times for care
Judy talks abt Association Health Plans - allows small businesses to have options like big employers. Has voted for this six times in House
Caller talks about need for reform, but expresses concern about effects of public option. Says small business cant afford insurance for care
2nd caller asks Congress to procede slowly w reform, Judy notes that constituents are really well-informed, outspoken on this complex topic
1st ? Re: access, esp. for uninsured; Judy points out millions eligible for Medicare/SCHIP but not enrolled, so number lower than appears
Judy speaking about the bill before the House and about the reforms she supports - AHPs, health IT, expanded coverage, etc.
Hey all - doing a tele-townhall to talk about health care with constituents tonight. Staff will be tweeting during the call

Hearing now ending, thanks to panelists for participating and everyone following
UCS replies: role of ccs ambiguous, more demonstration projects such as futuregen needed
Next ? re carbon capture/sequestration. Heritage rep says it's relatively inefficient, but also asks where we can put it.
#heritage - this will kill more old-line jobs than it creates green jobs. NRDC points out that 27 governors support #aces even coal states
Midwest manufacturing, ag sectors could lead green economy. #heritage responds impact will be national, midwest will be esp hard hit
Next ? re concerns about Midwest under #aces given coal's value in the region's economy. UCS says midwest can take advantage of green jobs
Realtors: older homes could have their values stigmatized for not being energy-efficient. reasonable approach preferred
USCC: carbon tariffs will spur trade retaliation. Mrs Biggert: China building one new coal plant every 2.5 days. Next ? re building codes
Next to USCC re china/india issue. One of USCC's biggest issue is US competitiveness, #climatechange is a global issue.
Mrs. Biggert: nuclear needs to be a part of our energy future
Exelon discussing nuclear as low-carbon source in American energy. Climate regulation may impose costs on economy, very difficult to predict
NRDC says retrofitting buildings will create jobs here, not overseas. Exelon next - what does #aces mean for them, for industry in midwest?
#heritage - "cost of doing nothing is a silly concept," says that by 2100 temps will fall by very little. Response from NRDC.
Response from #heritage rep re differing studies, underlying models. Differences re nuclear, offsets
Mrs. Biggert: clearly different studies give different results, and if Congress doesn't act, EPA will. 1st ? to UCS rep re his study
"Taxes go up, incomes go down, jobs go away" under #aces energy costs rise 50-90%, GDP drops by trillions in long run
Final panelist: David Kreutzer of #heritage calls cap-trade an energy tax, says increased alt energy production will not compensate for this
Calls free dumping of carbon into atmosphere " subsidy," argues that it burdens alternatives. Putting cost on carbon will address this
Some regs in #aces will burden homeowners and will not necessarily conserve energy. Next: natural resource defense council. Supports c&t
Next: IL Assn of Realtors. NAR generally supportive of market-based approaches over EPA regs. But c&t should not limit options
But legislation must encourage technology, protect consumers. Exelon "encouraged" by #aces. Next up, representative from navistar corp
Ralph Loomis, Exelon (energy co in IL, PA): Exelon long involved in working to address #climatechange.
Davis supports nuclear, clean coal, other forms of alt energy currently; says waxman-Markey is regulation-heavy
Davis (USCC) refers to #aces as a tax on business, argues that developing nations may not follow america's lead on addressing this.
Matt Davis, US Chamber - agrees #climatechange needs to be addresses but internationally and in a way that protects American jobs
Ron burke, union concerned scientists, discussing costs of #climatechange and benefits of green economy (climate 2030 report) via #aces
Discussing her concern for climate change, support for nuclear & alternative energy. Concerns w #aces re jobs, intntl competitiveness
Event starting, Mrs. Biggert welcoming panelists, some of whom travelled a ways to be here. Introducing #aces to audience
Cap-and-trade hearing will be starting in the next few minutes #aces
Reminder, staff will be live-tweeting this AM's cap-and-trade/#ACES be sure to follow. Seven panelists from all sides of the issue

Judy working w other members from IL to help affected communities pay for safety fixes
Call re CN/EJ&E merger, CN won, will increase traffic but are arrogantly refusing to pay to help communities adapt.
Talking abt need to cut taxes on small business, help them access credit - theyr engines of job creation, taxes hikes in recession will hurt
Judy talking about anti-mortgage fraud bills she has written (Senate has ignored) we need more action to restore trust in the system

Talking need to move past "gotcha" politics, some of you got misleading calls on Judy's positions, she wanted bigger pay raises for troops
More calls, discussion re need to increase access to credit
Judy is talking about the need for increased oversight, accountability w TARP funds. Her committees are having many hearings on this topic
