Sharon Stone should go hangout with Catherine Deneuve. They can be misogynistic victim shamers together. I stand with @VioletPaley I heard about James Franco for years. Kill your darlings, gain your soul. Creeps.

Your view of what is obvious
Because as a citizen and as a private activist, I knew our societal constructs were not working. So I decided to actually do something about it. I have dedicated my life‚Äôs work to changing the world. The lies that media has so often been paid to tell about me may be coloring
With #RoseArmy as an umbrella, I‚Äôve created many new ways to access a reset button. These new ways haven‚Äôt been made clear. More will come. The first step was smashing a propaganda machine of male power, the 1st part of the massive social re-engineering project I‚Äôve undertaken
.@USAToday Your headline is wrong. My platform is thought. I am here to challenge the system. All of the systems. #RoseArmy is separate from #MeToo. #RoseArmy is about creating a different way of thinking. Of rewiring traditions. Correct your headline https://t.co/onxiacX199
I have been shooting footage for my documentary for 3 years. I have been working on my album and book for 3 years. My skincare line for 12 years. And I have been working on my whistleblowing &amp; taking the motherfucking Monster down for twenty years. Now do you get it? #RoseArmy
FYI: not turning #MeToo into a show. I‚Äôm documenting the past 3 months of my life as I ready BRAVE my book for publishing. I trademarked #ROSEARMY 3 years ago. I am part of #MeToo because I am a Me Too, it‚Äôs not my movement. My book hasn‚Äôt come out, don‚Äôt assume anything.

Parents &amp; Educators: Please teach boys that just because it excites them to have semen, and gives them an inflated sense of ego to ejaculate, it is, in fact, not an achievement beyond taking a breath. NO GOLD STAR #ROSEARMY
Men, understand this: Your semen isn‚Äôt gold. The majority of us do not want your semen. Why? Because your semen is the most average thing on earth.

Hey Roy Moore, when I was 14, a man picked me up a block away from my dad‚Äôs house. It‚Äôs crazy Roy, it‚Äôs just like you did to your 14 year old victim! And do you know what happened to me, Roy? He molested me. Just like you did to that poor girl. I got Roy Moored.
Louis C.K. admitted he committed an ILLEGAL act. There better be some criminal justice following this statement.
Louis C.K.‚Äôs statement reads like it‚Äôs been locked in his safe just waiting for the day he‚Äôd need it.
We will no longer settle for sexual assault as our life description, let alone work description. #ROSEARMY https://t.co/Fe2TrCncfh
I heard stories about Louis C.K. 2 years ago. I‚Äôm in no way connected to the comedy scene, and I‚Äôd heard of it. Industry faux-shock is such a tired lie. I send my strength and love to all women hurt by him &amp; the code of complicity.
If Roy Moore had molested little boys, the far right would have kicked him out ASAP. But because it‚Äôs just girls they won‚Äôt believe. More of a problem with a gay predator than a straight predator.
