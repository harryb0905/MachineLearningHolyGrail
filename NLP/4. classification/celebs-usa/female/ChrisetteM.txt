Dear @rolandsmartin we as a people need to fact check and stop being spoon fed. I can accept people's choices. I shouldn't be disrespected for assumptions that aren't true. The Inauguration was after the election and I thought I'd help us heal. I was wrong.

How do we not know by now what the definition of a strong black woman is? Why do we still have such a difficult time recognizing greatness when we see it? Who's oblivious to the greatness of Michelle Obama, Roxane Gay, Issa Rae, Maxine Waters and countless others?

Kansas City is such a WARM place. The people are kind. I must make mention of that. It's VERY noticeable. Thank you for a great time 🙏🏾
@JustTbo I think I may have said "they're fake"... I feel like she just said "oh"... But it's all a blur. I'm traumatized.
@sassysag11963 I could not find the words... So I smiled and took a few breaths... (Ummmm whet?)
Ma'am. 👀
When you're in the produce aisle and Mary Tyler Moore's auntie comes to touch your dreads from behind "How long have you been growing them?"
@Realkingvice there's really no point in sharing my gift. Anyways... See you in Philly. Cheers
@Realkingvice the word "conform" means people think I'm doing things to "be like" something else. If people don't know I'm me...
@Realkingvice yeah. It's just sad that people don't know we're expressing OURselves. We don't stay the same just because we started one way.
Kansas City!!! It goes down tonight at The Midland!!! Here's a pic from last night in DC!!! See you tonight!!! https://t.co/6SESmbRTed https://t.co/AUBWJrT15W
@Realkingvice but it's definitely something I face daily. Comes with the territory. It's still annoying tho
@Realkingvice there's nothing I dislike more than people critiquing "expression". It's like you can't judge someone's CREATIVITY. 😳

@CamilleBrielle_ was too expensive for a major label to produce. So I created The Lyricists Opus when I went indie. Take a listen
@CamilleBrielle_ part of it is on the girlfriends soundtrack, part of it is on my 1st album. And part of it...
@CamilleBrielle_ I am the little people. I think sometimes they forget they wanted me to soar.
Thank you ❤️ https://t.co/sxNPvcKXbQ

It looks like a madhouse today. But I know there is love. Love is big. Love exists and love is greater then the broken heart we call home.
One day people will stand together and tall, arm in arm for a united love and the idea of friendship will be refreshed.
I'm excited for the re-emergence of holding hands, loving one another, teaching and peaceful expression where you don't have to be afraid...
Everyone is so busy keeping it real that it's a nightmare to disagree or converse. We don't "get along" the way we used to.
Everyone is antagonistic and degrading no matter who they're speaking to or about. There's no more respect or honor. Opinions but no love.
It seems like everyone is so angry these days. There's no more conversation or understanding. We don't listen or ask why...
Me too. It's a wonderful time to be inspired, we must keep hope alive. Till next time ❤️💋✨✌🏾️ https://t.co/btURlrYaAW
You're so very welcome, it's my humble honor to inspire and lift with love. ✌🏾❤️💋🌟 https://t.co/osEm2DIVdY

So excited to spend some time lifting spirits, singing and engaging in conversation with the NAACP. See you there.  https://t.co/AR43HUVepa
@TheBlackChannel it's totally not... I can't even believe you... We push to no avail... Enjoy your perspective, I pray it yields some hope.
@JohnnyACE562 I'm asking you to be peaceful to the soldiers who stand with you. The black people you wish to educate...
@Al_Hence enlighten one another with out hatred and judgement.
@Al_Hence you may never know how many black schools and colleges I've spoken at in the last 12 months alone. Either way, we can peacefully..
@JohnnyACE562 ...and you tell me to close my mouth in terms most derogatory. #teachme you've read so much, educate your own. Peacefully
@TheBlackChannel and we can still be called coons by our own on social media, we wonder how United we are. You can teach with out division.
@TheBlackChannel record deals. But when we begin to own things finally and sell through our own chains and stores and no one notices...
@TheBlackChannel I can see how you think that. My money doesn't come from record sales. I don't know how many artist will ever recoup...
@Al_Hence I agree 1000 percent. God forbid I purchase books for a black school from a white owned store, I'm a part of the problem. #teachme
@LaCreoleGriot my love you don't even know what business you're speaking to and what black businesses her merchandise is sold in.
@Majer_Mims money? Do u think that makes me comfortable being black in America? You really think black soul artists get mainstream dollars?
@JohnnyACE562 name your solution. Teach this generation. Go ahead... Humbly listening for ONE PERSON WITH AN ACTUAL SOLUTION.
@JohnnyACE562 boycotting me won't impress Target. I don't have a brand there. Changing laws will change our home, not degrading each other
@LadyDjteesamone I know. Many did. It's about 50/50. I just wish the great minds would teach instead of degrade. I'd listen...
@JayDean03 we spent so many years saying come together here's our chance &amp; we tear each other's words to shreds. Teach me but don't hate me
@JayDean03 no but I do want re-education of what we do &amp; don't have for my generation. If we've been fooled show a solution for real change
@TheBlackChannel no. Im saying if we've gained anything from what our forefathers fought for, lets utilize it to go further.
@timeyin21 of course not. I everyone wants to fight but not explain how we win. I love that we know we need to fight now I just want the how
@hulksmashgq I agree and we certainly don't have enough of that at all unfortunately.
@LeeLeeAne I hear you. It feels that way often for me too. I do however think that our ancestors found value in things we take for granted
@TropicalDelite well show me how we can stand together and I'll be there with you. You've gotta want to join forces... And lift each other.
@LeftSentThis I don't know if our young people know what their "goal" is. I don't know if they understand the system enough to change it.
@TheRealKDON I know. And that's why I'm wondering if the same solution today will be of great avail.
@TropicalDelite I think I can help. I think I am available to my community. I think sharing our ideas together may make our voice stronger
@TropicalDelite I think your perception of my lifestyle is tainted. I think you mean well, but I don't believe I'm your enemy.
@Ellevation_ right. I agree... It's like we "almost" have our rights. And we "almost" matter. What can we do with the "almost"... Honestly
@LeftSentThis you know? I've just seen so many of them and been in them myself and still feel like there's gotta be another way...
@LeftSentThis we certainly have and we certainly still do. How will what you want to see happen occur... What is the answer
No #PoliticalGenius but I do live here, and I am experiencing this madness with you. https://t.co/7Eka9OPl67
@kidadonis I understand. I understand why it seems to make sense. But when those companies lose money who do you think will be laid off 1st?
@pmurraymusic I wouldn't mind you offering a solution. I think everyone is looking for one. Including you and me. That's the unifying factor
@pmurraymusic I expect critique in everything I do. I'm used to it. But living in this country, gives me the same worries as you.
@pmurraymusic I'm not worried about being silent. Silence isn't the issue.I'm worried about where anger gets placed and if it hurts or helps
@LeftSentThis perhaps it is. Perhaps it isn't. My goal is to seek answers and open non-judgmental conversation where we are all vulnerable.
@TropicalDelite I'm not sure your point here. I'd love to converse with you but I'm not sure why I'm considered a house slave. Explain...
@JustAlly I want 2 see us stand on greatness. We are great, it feels like they can't tell. That hurts. How do we turn that hurt into change
@JustAlly many are. I'd like to see young people doing so more. I think we are great, I think we fought for this greatness.
@Ellevation_ I've listened 2 many reasons why he's hated. I wonder what politician isn't. I do think speaking to him where it matters is key
@JAC_4ALLTrades its important that we re-invest in ourselves.I think educating young people about how politics and laws are made is one way.
I agree and I believe it's in many things. I feel we have so many new ways to "make a statement".  https://t.co/gqEXHZXJOf
@JAC_4ALLTrades it's a shame that we are stuck in the same experiences as our forefathers. I  wonder, what we have NOW that we didn't before
@JAC_4ALLTrades they have. You're right. I just hope that we can take some of the tools we fought for as tools for change today.
@TheRealKDON I'm looking for answers and unlike many, I'm not afraid to speak. I just think the convo begins with us. Don't hate me for that
@TheRealKDON treating me with anger because you don't agree doesn't make it easier for us to get ahead.
@TheRealKDON definitely don't think we aren't civil. I've marched too. I'm young. This is all new and it feels like nothing's working.
@Live_Beautiful and you wonder why celebrities don't speak. I will continue to open my mouth and search for solutions.
@Live_Beautiful well, this is my first one. Perhaps you've been sent to educate me and others. I'm open to talking it thru... If you're open
@The_Monae I feel that way too. This country was built by us but not for us... And with the lemons we have... What is another solution...
@kidadonis 140 characters my friend. That's all I have on THIS platform. 140 characters.
@Audj_The_Mrs ofcourse that's not the only answer. Of course. It was certainly what our forefathers thought to be AN answer.
@Audj_The_Mrs I hear you sis. But I don't know that coming against the ones who are, helps much either. Join with them. Support them.
@HiDanaKay I don't know that paying police officers over time to police us while we boycott does either.
@kidadonis I want the people in counsel to change. I don't know that Target can change that. Target isn't accountable. The system is.
@kidadonis of course it existed. I want the laws to change. I want black judges. I want black mayors. I want black letters written.
@arinola91 my platform is a human one. My platform isn't run by a political expert. My platform hurts and is looking for hope, just like you
@Live_Beautiful again, I'm no political genius... I have questions like you do, and I'm not afraid to ask them. I hate the news as much as U
@danielriveraone if you're only listening to their music on the radio then of course you won't see what they are doing ✨
@Live_Beautiful and it hurts me as much as it hurts you... I think my point of view is warranted and conversation is opening because of it.
@danielriveraone I don't think we shouldn't be able to... I just wonder what new tactics can be utilized.
@Audj_The_Mrs if you're angry with ME, then you're not paying attention Sis.
@Audj_The_Mrs she then invested that money into my education and I became one of those "celebrities" who pushes for change.
@Audj_The_Mrs my mother arrived when she made it out of Queensbridge projects and received a masters degree and became an educator.
@xoTmonroe girlfriend, none of this is fair. Our forefathers fought for education for a reason. NONE of this is FAIR.
@xoTmonroe agree 100%... That's a great conversation. How can we get better books in our schools... Do we home school?
@xoTmonroe being black in America and winning isn't easy... I understand that...
@xoTmonroe if only you knew where they came from and how they got there and what they do to pull others up. This life takes HARD HARD work.
@HOTKOOLVICIOUS but in so many ways, those folks are winning and re-investing, training new ones up and moving forward.
@Earth_BE that's right. That makes sense. I hear that 100%
@TheLifeofK__ let's talk about what IS happening. I didn't wake up with this on my heart to be what ISN'T happening 🙏🏾
@xoTmonroe I understand. It isn't easy when we are searching for answers.
@TheLifeofK__ take a look at #BlackCelebrityGiving... An incredible showcase of some places black celebrities give back to blacks.
@TheLifeofK__ I think a better question is investigating where celebrities invest. I'm not sure people are really watching.
❤️💋 and I understand their frustration. I just wanted to begin this conversation, I know folks will have opinions. https://t.co/rzH7XKTgM7
@IsisPaperzZ @arinola91 I'd love to share in conversation with you. I really would. Intelligent &amp; respectful conversation. #wecouldBechange
@ARKATECHBEATZ we definitely need to and are building our own. I agree. I think it takes steps and I believe we are getting closer daily.
And what happens when we own have of the merchandise at Target... Do we boycott that also? https://t.co/x4yhpVQyiK
@arinola91 I agree... But not purchasing black brands from big chains, doesn't help us build black economy.
@vicelatino so many things force media to listen. I would love to see us utilize the new tools we've been given, like education &amp; voting.
@arinola91 I understand. And I believe boycotts should have more intentional instruction. I'm obviously well read. I'm not "celebrities".

@hilaryshideaway you're smart. You completely understand where I'm coming from. Be well belle. Change is okay. You can do it
@hilaryshideaway @hilaryshideaway and you're welcome. Never mix bitch and judgement in the same sentence as confidence and underestimation
@hilaryshideaway but they say it comes with my territory. People don't care about artists feelings. People like you, anyway.
@hilaryshideaway if I do, they tell me what they WERE gonna call me and then say they're being real. They're usually hurting me
@hilaryshideaway I see. I meet people like you daily. Who have already decided who I am. If I don't smile they call me what ever they like.
@johnjaysims I will. No worries. Xoxoxo light ray. Thank you
@_NewPurpose no worries. No peace stolen. Just had to make that point. I read stuff like that every single day.
@enigmaticsoulrg they won't. Just being clear that's all.
Nite y'all. I'm moody. Folks be tryin it tho
@stephanhoward2 @kokovisions because sometimes women should help other women know how to carry a positive conversation.
@Shadagirl07 me neither!! Lol
Yeah. Leave them lil ol rumors alone. I'm sure she meant well. But the B word can always stay off my timeline.  https://t.co/dwV8s7Q1Xa
@NoraA45 @MelissaMono @hilaryshideaway I did. Just tired of women making believe it's ok to judge and then say "I'm just real".
I'm used to it. Unfortunately.  https://t.co/QYHegwmTKl
@hilaryshideaway I did. But the B word and hearing that there are rumors that I am one, was a lot to read. Be all the way positive.
@GlamorousCEO I did. I still think it was a lot. Like, no one needs to see "hi there are rumors that you're a B". It's just rude. It's fine
@hilaryshideaway yikes. Hurts my feelings that you're comfortable typing those harsh words and tagging my name. Very hurtful.

I have a great disdain for speed bumps. A great disdain. I TRULLY dislike them. Immensely. (Because I can't drink coffee on a bumpy surface)
