I keep refreshing the Sacramento County Sherrif's Dept facebook page for the live feed of the Golden State Killer Press Conference. Starts in 10 mins.
@JarettSays I agree. I laughed out loud.
if this is in fact the guy, and i'm awaiting the noon press conference, #MichelleMcNamara was right about everything. navy, police officer, how he evaded dogs, etc. it's all nuts. she did it from the other side. she got him.

@AndrewBoMonroe We shouldn‚Äôt look to a sitcom to do that. We should look into ourselves and to our empathy and our ability listen to each other while respecting other POVs.
Roseanne on Jimmy Kimmel about Trump: ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try to think positive‚Äù.   Well, actions speak louder. The Wall. The transgender military ban. The normalization of lying. The demonizing of the press. The rise in hate crimes. The POSITIVE is the MIDTERM ELECTIONS.
. @potus called ROSANNE to congratulate her on her ratings. This reinforces that he truly only cares about ‚Äúratings‚Äù and popularity and what‚Äòs on TV.  What is it all coming to?
Some reviews I‚Äôve been reading that Rosanne is attempting to bridge the gap in this country thru comedy are interesting... but I‚Äôm sorry, anyone who voted for A WALL is not trying to BRIDGE anything.

@AJWhitfield1 @whole30 nope, bc then you have to start over. BUT!! there's no reason you can't have a delicious meal. a chowder of some kind made with coconut milk.... a steamed or grilled lobster, baked potato, sauteed spinach w garlic and olive oil.... berries for dessert...
@dexterpodcast @whole30 Totally. I am not hungry and it doesn't feel like a "diet".
@flickerjensen @whole30 Not really since -- for 30 days -- I am fine eating "boring" food. I am not really doing the intensive stews and other dishes. Just simple clean easy to prepare food.
@varshvarsh @whole30 cooking sundays is key, i like to bake a bunch of chicken and salmon and burgers, steam a bunch of veggies, and so I'm ready-ish. if I get bored, i've had success eating out if need be, just being really annoying "is that cooked in olive oil?"

I am proud of us. That's all.
We will get in the pool &amp; swim and tread water and lift each other up. We will not sit on each others  shoulders and hold each other down.
A RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL BOATS. We will move forward w/ kindness. We will support &amp; encourage other women, applaud their successes as ours.
To be our best selves.
We must look at ourselves. At how we can make our industry kinder, more supportive, of how -- as women AND MEN -- we can build each other up
I have had FEMALE producers make comments to me about what I'm putting in my mouth. Things like "Don't get fat. No one will watch this."
... broke my heart and felt all too familiar.
The story Jennifer Lawrence told about being made to feel not thin enough, not pretty enough, constantly physically compared to others...
But if I'm honest, in that moment, I feel shame. I don't want the cake anymore. I don't want to celebrate. Don't even want to keep shooting.
I stare at him in defiance. I place a SEONCD piece of cake on my plate. I eat it as I stare him down, daring him to make another comment.
Photographer see me put a piece of cake on my plate. Comes over and says "You're not really going to eat that, are you sweetheart?"
2005. The day of my first big magazine cover shoot. I am 19 years old. Proud. Excited. Nervous. We shoot all morning. Then break for lunch.
I come back to the embrace of a sisterhood that was -- for so long -- quieted... One that now speaks in a full, clear voice without shame.
I vacillate between sadness, confusion and outrage. I shake my head at the all too familiar stories of so many different kinds of pressure.
The last few days I have been blown away by all the women coming forward to share their stories. Ones that feel immediately sadly familiar.
@Alyssa_Milano Me too
@BottegaVeneta Thank you for a beautiful and inspiring night.
HERE IS A FIERCE WOMAN https://t.co/bjDU8697sx

@PattyArquette @missmayim I was 8 years old in long petticoats in the theater when grown men were inappropriate with me. Nothing to do with flirting/outfit/manicure.
Amen, the academy!!!
Just love and respect and adore Emma so much and am so glad to have watched her interview this morning.
She taught me how to stick up for other women. To proceed without fear for what you think is right. To speak up when something feels wrong.
Emma Thompson is a fierce momma bear. Did BEAUTIFUL CREATURES with her. She‚Äôs the best. We should all be so lucky to have her on set with us
@joannatheobalds @ManohlaDargis Yes
Also bravo @RonanFarrow.
Excellent piece by @ManohlaDargis in this mornings NYTimes. This is the beginning of real change.
Entertainment Weekly says MR ROBOT season 3 is a NOIR MASTERPIECE. And it starts tonight on USA. So excited for you @samesmail.

I applaud all women for speaking up.  It‚Äôs scary to be the first one to speak out against something or someone. But you‚Äôre not solo for long
The ‚Äúold dinosaur‚Äù explanation doesn‚Äôt cut it. DECADES of using power to intimidate women for sexual gain is reprehensible and inexcusable.

@VictorHeIs @DeeJayPorge @realDonaldTrump Trump is in a position to DO something right now. Wake up.
I am tired of how easy it is to:  "Pray for (insert latest attack or natural disaster here)" Prayer + Action is the answer.
You might send your "warmest condolences" when a friend calls off a wedding or sprains an ankle. Not when 50 are dead and 400+ in hospital.
I believe in prayer, but it's not enough by itself.  We need better LAWS.  In no world does a CIVILIAN need a MACHINE GUN. Let's fix this.
Dear @realDonaldTrump, the people of Las Vegas don't need your hashtags and empty tweets about "warmest condolences". They need action.
Here's the number for your senators. Keep calling. https://t.co/s5Ww9uCgQp
Call you senators and keep calling. Let them hear your voice. Ask them how many more people would have died IF this guy had a silencer?
House GOP could pass legislation this week to:  1. repeal restrictions on gun silencers 2. allow concealed carry across state lines
I believe in the power of prayer. But I also believe faith gives us strength to act. Act w kindness, act w determination to fight evil.
I am heartbroken today. I don't want to just hashtag pray for the healing anymore. It's not enough. Not enough to sit &amp; tweet out prayers.
50 dead. Over 400 in the hospital. And we continue to call this a LONE WOLF? Call it TERRORISM because that's what it is.
This is too terrible to comprehend. #lasvegas

@dreamsick I'll let you know about the memorial this fall.
We are nothing without our teachers. Flo, from all your students, we love you and miss you already.
I spoke to her the morning of my wedding, as she was too ill to be there. We talked about love, marriage, work, travel, children, trust.
Even now, her kindness, humor and encouraging words are never far from mind. She wore the brightest lipstick and had the biggest heart.
For many years Flo was my teacher, mentor, friend. She helped me be unafraid to go to scary emotional places. I always felt safe with her.
I was maybe 9 when I read about Flo Greenberg in an interview with Matt Leblanc. I looked her up in the yellow pages &amp; went to meet her.
My beloved first acting coach, Flo Salant Greenberg passed away last week in New York. A teacher, mother &amp; advocate for all of her students.
MY BOOOOO, Frankie Shaw and SMILF will follow me right after SHAMELESS  https://t.co/qmByUx2GFk

Read about a couple "celebrating" a move into a new house. They died from doing cocaine w a tiny bit of fentanyl in it. Heartbreaking.
I've never been into drugs but reading about all this hit me HARD for some reason. There is an epidemic happening in parts of North America.
One pill or line can have a tiny tiny bit of fentanyl and the next pill or line won't. So it's not like you can "just do a little and see."
Fentanyl (100x stronger than MORPHINE) is DEADLY even in the tiniest amount. It's mixed into cocaine, extacy and other recreational drugs.
People need to know what fentanyl is and how dangerous it is. https://t.co/uNcgnDqm3V

@ChinaJoeFlynn No. Chelsea.
When I finally identify an actual grocer, I say "Fennel?" He says, "Sold out." Who SELLS OUT of FENNEL?  Like, people like fennel THAT MUCH?
That awkward moment when you ask a guy in the produce section, "Pardon me, do you have any fennel?" And he responds, "I don't work here."

@jessicakouns @Cosmopolitan Yes. For me, the first instinct is to freak out and be like WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW!? So, a deep breath &amp; keep a professional tone
@EmmyFansTumblr @Cosmopolitan They aren't even worth your time, they just want attention.
@EmmyFansTumblr @Cosmopolitan that's what the "mute" function is for :)
@AmazonVideo @robdelaney @catastrophe_tv Oh, it's already on my calendar.
@saharsanjar It was atrocious years ago and it still is. It's fucking disgusting and heartbreaking and not human.
Why I said "no" to auditioning in a bikini.  Read @Cosmopolitan and watch the short films we made #ThatsHarassment https://t.co/Y7GiDI6xZH
#CynthiaNixon and I spoke to @Cosmopolitan about our short film &amp; how we've experienced sexual harassment. https://t.co/Y7GiDI6xZH

@tansworld Exercise. Also, chicken and eggs and oil are healthy proteins and fats that help the body heal and stay healthy and strong!!
@PAYbcksabitch The whole organic chicken is 15 bucks and it is good for about 4 meals.
Breakfast. Soft boil eggs. Crack, then drizzle on pan drippings from last night's roasted lemon chicken (refrigerate &amp;skim fat). SO GOOD.
@AdamSalky Interesting.
Making a roast chicken. A little unprepared. Just improvised and used wood manicure sticks (unused!) as skewers to tie up the bird.

@samesmail Honey, I love you.
Thank you to the LAPD. I fully support the police efforts and dedication.
A bird actually just sh*t on my head. I didn't actually think that was a thing that happened, but... yes, it it does.

Good morning, Vancouver!!!
@RetiredHutch nah we pollute enough
@BiggameCB I don't. I like people. It's just a few who are not my cuppa tea.
So I have to listen to THIS on a plane and miss @maddow and the tax return info.
These kind of interactions make me crazy.
She tries to mention her boyfriend in the conversation. He mentions a Thai massage he got and wonders why he didn't get a happy ending.
He tells her her chest is hanging out of her top. She laughs uncomfortably and then shifts it to cover more. He says why? It looks good.
Sitting on a plane. A man chats with a women in a seat nearby.

Flew out of NY tonight just before Stella hit. One of my favorite things about living on the East Coast is weather. That said, be safe.
Last night someone asked me, "Are you the girl in shingles?"  I said, "Huh?"  Her friend was like "SHAMELESS, not SHINGLES."

@calopph @nytimesarts watch his films. I suggest you start with "about elly"
@sinyrunner @nytimesarts @POTUS watch his films before you form an opinion. He's actually quite critical of the Iranian laws.
@ShaunKing Actually I think it was Reagan, but he was recovering from being shot. So there's that. (via @npr)
THIS IS EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION. @POTUS ACTS OUT OF FEAR AND HATRED OF EVERYTHING HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. #RESIST https://t.co/SG9UgSH7R1
@SweetJem17 Of course!! There are MALE nurses too! :) This is about educating our kids that anyone - regardless of gender - can be anything.

I broke up with him.
"I want to be a doctor when I grow up" I told my first "boyfriend" in pre-school. He said, "You can be a NURSE, girls can't be DOCTORS."

Trump shut down a reporter for asking abt the rise in anti-Semitic threats, as it was not an "easy" question. Then called the journ a liar.
It's hard to even watch the news anymore and actually take in what is happening. That "press conference" yesterday was unhinged and insane.

There's a scene in a hotel or apt bldg, a bathtub overflows and falls through multiple stories of the building. Anyone know?
A movie I saw in theaters when I was really young. Trying to remember what it's called. I think it is maybe set in South America?
I just read Roald Dahls short story THE LANDLADY and now I'm sure to have nightmares.

@JennJayBee @altonbrown that's the one I did.....
@AriB_12 rinsed but not soaked
My first year brining so I cut off a little piece and cooked it to taste test. All I taste is SALT. It's like a salt lick.
Gonna soak in water while I go get a back up turkey.
This brine made the turkey incredibly salty. Like, borderline we might have to order pizza salty.
This is the first and last year I brine a turkey.

This is 1 individual who targeted me. He since deleted the awful train pic. Why not check out the rest of his posts/likes @SpotEnemyBoats

Trump supporters are sending me messages threatening to send me &amp; my "ilk" to the gas chambers &amp; writing hashtags like "#sieg hiel". NOT OK.
Tomorrow is another day. Night night.

@iloveeebabs I hear you and I feel you. I support you.
We are in this together.
I am a woman. I am Jewish. I am marrying an Arab American. My sister in law is handicapped. I'm a victim of sexual violence. It's personal.
It's hard to understand how so many l people saw something so differently than you did. It feels personal to so many.
I respect our country, the voices, values and systems that made us strong. I respect the other side &amp; their opinions, even tho I don't agree
So I'm sad. But I woke up this morning and the sun came up. And I made my breakfast and fed the dogs. And the world didn't end.
I wanted to tell her she could achieve anything she wanted. That she would win if she led with kindness. Not to make fun of people.Or bully.
This morning still sad. I was looking forward to the next 4 yrs. To having a child, maybe a daughter, under the first female president.
When they go low, we go high. We regroup. We listen. We double down. We bet on us. Good night.

@iamrashidajones Racists and Sexists.
STAY IN LINE. EVERY VOTE COUNTS.
I will gladly, eagerly and enthusiastically VOTE for Hillary Clinton.
I will vote for someone who has fought tirelessly their whole life for the little guy and who is READY TO BE PRESIDENT.
I will vote so that millions of honest tax paying hard working mothers and fathers are given a path to citizenship, and not deported.
I will vote so that WOMEN are in control of their medical decisions and have access to screenings and mammograms at planned parenthood.
I will vote to protect the rights of my Arab American soon to be family.
I will vote to protect my heritage. For the candidate who believes we have to UNITE. NOT the man who's fans yell "JEW-S-A" at rallies.
I will VOTE. I will vote so that Nancy -- my friend -- isn't mocked and made fun of for her disability.
I will vote to protect women. I will vote to protect our constitution.
Tomorrow I will VOTE. I will vote to change history. I will vote to set our country in the right direction.
After 20 solid weeks of intense shooting it feels really good to not go to work today. I'm sure I'll be stir crazy by Wednesday.

Something else really BOTHERED me about Trump tonight...  he constantly LURKED and FOLLOWED Clinton around the stage https://t.co/Yj2bhBTDWt
@BryanJames69 @SHO_Shameless That's cool!!! :)
I encourage everyone with different opinions to speak up, the differences between us is what makes this country great!!!
I am glad we live in a free country, one where everyone has the right to FREE SPEECH. Please, feel FREE to unfollow me.
@chels_rae2 YES but he's saying as a senator she could have just passed whatever laws she wanted which is not TRUE.
Trump talked for 40:10 &amp; Clinton talked for 39:05. And he kept whining SHE GETS MORE TIME THAN MEEEEEE
Please register to VOTE and VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE.
I just told @nbcwashington who I think is winning. Cast your vote now! #Debates #NBC4DC https://t.co/q9LM5QalEm
YES marriage equality! YES roe v wade! #imwithher
Yes, actually DONALD, you told us in a 3am twitter rant to go check out a sex tape.
@patmelliott11 @YNB They can't just DECIDE to pass laws!
Hate in a heart is what YOU HAVE, Donald Trump.
@Van_Velsor Please unfollow me, you ignorant shmuck.
"African-Americans - Inner Cities".... apparently the same thing to Donald Trump.
I like hearing a PLAN from Hillary. "Specifically target al baghdadi..." Like she took out Bid Laden. #imwithher
Also did Trump just say he "talks to Assad"????
YES PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOUR STRATEGY IS
Wow. Trump isn't even ON THE SAME PAGE AS HIS RUNNING MATE about Syria.  "We haven't spoken."
Does Trump know that Senators don't make laws, Congress does? #debate
Donald Trump just admitted to paying to no federal income taxes since 1995. #Debate
Hillary's FRIENDS aren't RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
Hillary will cut taxes for working people.  Trump will cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires.
Trump "knows nothing about Russia" but loves Putin and think he's a "stronger leader than Obama". fact.
Does ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE HELL this person is talking about? When it comes to actual policies, he paces and doesn't make ANY SENSE.
Trump just said Syrian refugees are pouring into us by the "hundreds of thousands"???? NO. Only 11,000 so far. Canada has admitted 35,000.
We should not say "we will ban people based on religion" - @HillaryClinton #debate https://t.co/84y3kB6lKi
People research which organizations can actually endorse a candidates. Please just research. He's up there spewing total bs #debate
Trump: "She just went about 25 seconds over her time" Martha Raddatz: "She did not."
By the way, the original call for a ban is STILL ON HIS WEBSITE. #debate
Donald Trump, A RACIST, XENOPHOBIC, HATEFUL person, just suggested a Muslim American soldier would be alive if he were President. DISGUSTING
"We are NOT at war with Islam!" Thank you, @HillaryClinton.
Trump:  Provide a great plan. The hugest plan! Ever. But not sure what it is.
thank you LET'S TALK ABOUT ISSUES.
Wait, did Trump just add 6000 emails to that number?
To the crowd in this town hall, it's not A WRESTLING MATCH. Be quiet please so we can hear.
Mod: "Have you committed sexual assault?"  Trump: "ISIS"  Mod: "That's not what I..."  Trump: "ISIS"  Mod: "I..."  Trump: "ISIS"  #debate
THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS AT YOU, DONALD TRUMP. THEY ARE FURIOUS AT YOUR RACIST HATEFUL BEHAVIOR.
That's not just words. That's describing sexual assault. Which is what you said you did.
I have NEVER been prouder to stand WITH HER.
I can't believe you're saying that about yourself either! #dumptrump
"Our country is GREAT because we are GOOD!!!" #AMEN #imwithher
Good for you. I wouldn't touch him with a 10 foot pole.
@LynPaolo @ChelseaClinton Right there don't worry

@samesmail I love you. You're funny.
When she was pregnant, Donald Trump called his wife Melania a "blimp" and a "monster"... https://t.co/EC4QSeTweA
Donald Trump thinks women are disposable after 35, he tells Howard Stern. "What is it at 35? It's called check-out time."
Donald Trump tells Howard Stern about Ivanka: "it's okay to call my daughter a piece of ass" https://t.co/sLkMFb9xr1
Acceptable to @GOP Leaders who endorse Trump: ‚úì Racism ‚úì Sexism ‚úì Homophobia ‚úì Xenophobia ‚úì Tax fraud ‚úì Consumer fraud ... Sexual assault
Replaying Scottie's expression after Anna served it up to her is the only thing making me laugh right now
I don't believe we are responsible for our parents actions but HOW can his children stand by &amp; continue to justify, defend and support him?
Scottie Nell Hughes has FEAR in her eyes. She doesn't even believe what she is saying right now on CNN.
That was NOT an apology.
I guess SEXUAL ASSAULT -- "grab (women) by the pussy" -- really put the RNC over the edge.
RNC didn't denounce Trump when he called for a ban on all Muslims or when he praised Vladimir Putin.
RNC didn't denounce Trump when he said McCain wasn't a hero or when he made fun of people with disabilities or said Mexicans were rapists.
The statements Trump makes in the leaked tapes are promoting sexual assault. 100%.
@LynPaolo beyond. she didn't even look like she believed herself.
This is how Trump supporters talk about women. https://t.co/E4qU2cMW9V
Donald Trump thinks "when you're a star" you "can do anything" to women? Well you can't make me vote for you, you misogynistic entitled pig.
Donald Trump says: "when you're a star you can do anything. grab (women) by the pussy"

Pence, you can laugh all you want but when Tim Kaine literally QUOTES what Trump said, you just LIE and say he didn't say that. BUT HE DID.
#VPDebate Mike Pence is so "sincere" I want to throw up.

@saharsanjar @LesterHoltNBC No, he let him show how RUDE he is and HANG HIMSELF OUT TO DRY
YEAH HERE WE GO
You said "she doesn't have the LOOK" that's the quote.
I really wish Hillary would ask Donald where his TIE WAS MADE
China? lots of talk about China! Your Trump SUIT was probably MADE IN CHINA
I think he's SHORT CIRCUITING
this is an snl skit
THE RECORD SHOWS THAT I'M RIGHT? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
Let's just remember, SHE TOOK OUT BIN LADEN.
"We came up with the internet"? What?
Now we are making fun of fat people? So all hackers are 400 pounds? Dude clearly doesn't watch Mr Robot.
Racist claims brought on you and others as well? so... if MANY people are racist, then that's cool?
WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH. THANK YOU!
Is Donald Trump speaking English? DID HE JUST SAY HE STILL BELIEVES OUR PRESIDENT IS FROM KENYA AGAIN?
STILL TALKING ABOUT STOP AND FRISK because you are a blatant racist Donald Trump.
#NoFlyNoBuy Thank you!
"Stop and frisk worked really well!!"   .........said by people who've never been stopped and frisked!!!!!!!!!!!!
Maybe she should hand him a tissue? I mean, why is he SNIFFING SO MUCH
DID HE JUST TELL LESTER HE WAS WRONG?
YES LESTER THANK YOU
IT ONLY PROMOTED RACIAL PROFILING
STOP AND FRISK NEVER WORKED
Hope you are following along with the FACT CHECKING https://t.co/5U2lWC8AXa
Why is Trump sniffing so much?!
"Maybe I was dissasisfied" -- also ADMITTING he doesn't pay his workers
"We are a third world country?" Are you serious? have you ever BEEN to a third world country, Donald Trump?
"that makes me smart?" you literally just ADMITTED YOU DONT PAY TAXES
LESTER: "it's negotiable?"
Basically:     "you can be just like me and make 600 mil a year if you just BELIEVE ME"
Oh, I'm glad we are talking about GOLF
Trump is literally IMPLODING
I'm glad Donald Trump is striving to be "semi-exact" tonight.
Why is Donald Trump SNIFFING so much? Is he sick? should we worry about his HEALTH?
Why wont Donald Trump answer the question? Specifically?!

@chrissyteigen WHAT. WATCH IT IMMEDIATELY.
@TheRealDaytime @stevehowey @SHO_Shameless Looking handsome!!!
So so so excited to see @samesmail tonight! It's been WEEKS of us working on opposite coasts!!!!
She's in that big opera house in the sky!!!! We were her kids. She was my second mother. https://t.co/bkKE8rJQj5
One of the best moments of my life.Always dreamed of doing quando men vo on the met stage. Elena taught it to me when I was 11! Tiny Musetta
Elena threw me up on the stage and made me sing quando men vo -- acapella -- to 3800 empty seats...while she stood in the orchesta pit
Just a few years ago, we were in the Met on Christmas Day for a lesson... the whole place was empty...just a few stage hands cleaning...
Never been late or missed work ever because of how Elena taught me. She didn't believe in "traffic, holidays or excuses"... so neither do I.
from technique, to passion... to breathing, to singing on the vowels only, to pronunciation... we learned so much...
she saw greatness in us before we did...  she taught us to sing Puccini "the way he would have wanted it sung"...
thinking about the great teacher we lost last week...  vocalizing her way... singing some songs she taught me from when I was a wee thing
@SupermarketerNY Did you work with her? I considered her my 2nd mother. I miss her greatly already.
Disgusting https://t.co/drpUcJ3CGK
She believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. Was like the grandma I never got to have. I am crushed learning of her passing.
Elena Doria. My coach, mentor, teacher, friend. Taught me technique, professionalism, passion. Since I was 7 years old at the Met Opera.
Let's do it all over again on Monday! #Shameless
Still wrapped early and got great shots. So grateful tonight to have been supported in the way I did on this episode. My first as director.
Huge thanks to our crew.Rain machines, FX,lightning,party scenes,backlot,night shooting.Not sure what more we could have thrown at them.
@samesmail how many Bernstein/Berenstain Bears conversations did we have, Sam? #mrrobot

Promoting violence, torture &amp; savagery? Does this "make America great again"? Well I hope we don't ever have to see THAT America #NeverTrump
Be as violent as our enemies? Does Trump think we should cut off people's heads on video? Burn them in cages and put it on the internet?
Today Donald says about waterboarding: "I like it alot" and we have to be as "vicious and violent" as our enemies. #NeverTrump

I'm attracted to that feeling of emotional limbo on a plane.Suspended in the air,that surreal state in which almost anything seems possible.
Thank you @emmarcourt for your story about falling in love on an airplane &amp; being too nervous to make it more than just a fleeting moment.
So, you can only imagine how honored, flattered and nervous I was to be asked to read one of those stories for the new Modern Love podcast.
Each weekend, @samesmail &amp; I look forward to reading the Modern Love article (in the Sunday @nytimes) curated by the brilliant @danjonesnyt.
Another crazy moment of real life and #shameless merging on the streets of NYC.
A stranger on the corner just congratulated me on getting engaged. I said thanks &amp; showed him my ring. Then he said no, I meant on the show!

Caring for art like this is not normal.
I listen to Hamilton an absurd amount. Can't get thru the finale number without ugly cathartic crying. And I'm talking, in the back of taxis
Amen, @amyschumer. #thebachelor #WomenTellAll #InternationalWomensDay #proudtobecomplicated

@samesmail you didn't know I knew every word to mariah "we belong together" until our 6am Starbucks run this morning. #TheMoreYouKnow
Home sweet home. New York. Seamless. Top Chef. And discussing day 1 of robot with @samesmail! :)
Although I am afraid I may now be speaking English w/ a French accent so the French understand me better &amp; now I just sound like an idiot.
My 9th grade French is coming in handy. I was so pleased to congratulate en francais the creative team at Dior on a beautifully modern show.
@evachen212 @DeltaAssist @Dior come over to my hotel, get a bag and a jacket and you'll be good to go!

Inexplicably watching Christmas movies in March.
Witnessed a stranger do a random act of kindness for someone in need today in Union Square and it made my Monday so much better.
There's a reason that TGIMonday is not a thing.
Amen, Joe Biden.
.@Lin_Manuel makes #hamilton human&amp;electric &amp; serves up American history in a way that's easily metabolized &amp; deeply understood. Ok I'm done
If you have a chance -- I know I said it before -- see Hamilton on bway. In high school, I disliked history. Thought it was dry &amp; not alive.
Met @Lin_Manuel. Never been so star struck in my life. Introduced myself and almost cried three times just thinking about #Hamilton #Eliiiza
Couple great things happened today. Dories birthday! @doriegolkin we did arts and crafts and then saw our beloved @nyknicks!!
One of the best parts of my day is following @humansofny and reading the stories every day.
Courage is not the absence of fear.... Sometimes it means being afraid and doing the right thing anyway. We support you, @KeshaRose
@KeshaRose noone should EVER have to be around someone who hurt them in any way. Fully in support of you.

@shanolahampton I -- on the other hand -- am the opposite of a germaphobe. Whatever that is. Bless you, tho.
Truth be told, I don't think Shanola even used the bathroom in her private trailer the whole first season. #ArtMirroringLife #Shameless

No surprise there. We kind of always knew Chuckie was a little nazi. #shameless

An all new #shameless tonight! #shamelesssundays
Now of course I'm looking online for trailers that aired on primetime that featured exposed backs in a heterosexual kissing scene.....
So, it's ok to show guns, violence and people killing each other, but not ok to show two women, a bare back &amp; some kissing in a good movie?
ABC wont air the "Carol" trailer bc they want "more coverage‚Äù on the ladies? Coverage of what? You see a back and kissing. This is 2016.
In honor of #HolocaustMemorialDay, I read this profoundly poetic memoir by Marceline Loridan-Ivens. Check it. https://t.co/lSexxlo5lv

@NishaGanatra THANK YOU!!!! #DITTO
And somehow.... things just got worse... #shameless
My tear ducts were dry after this episode. #hormones #PleaseStopWritingFionaCries #shameless
That's family. I love this scene because sometimes family can be really cold and mean. #shameless
I like that the show deals with real stuff, even if it's in a slightly surreal way. Abortion. Mental health. Addiction. Poverty. #shameless
I pitched the line "I will set you on fire in your f*cking sleep". Sometimes the writers like the actors pitches and use them! :) #shameless
Macy and I wanted to work more together this year and requested it, so you'll be seeing more Frank/Fiona stuff this year. #shameless
@SHO_Shameless Should I vote?!
Anyone would be lucky to have a friendship like Fiona &amp; V. Solid, fun, loyal, tender, call each other on your sh*t kinda friends. #shameless

"It'll be like Disneyland... only with Abortions!"  #oof #Shameless
This episode was directed by the wonderful @NishaGanatra who also directed on #mrrobot! #Shameless
so....they insisted on having a burly guy holding me with a tether off camera so I wouldn't fall out the window! #shameless
That upstairs part of the real house in Chicago actually is more of an add-on attic and the window isn't very stable.
That was delicious chicken noodle soup -- gluten free. I actually hit Macy a few times right in the face. How's that for family? #shameless

Chivalry is not dead! A true gentleman on the plane named @tal4prez GAVE UP HIS SEAT FOR ME. Thank you!!!
Turns out, its like sitting on a bed of nails. I mean, BAD. I would have put down an extra pillow &amp; taken one for the team but guess what?
Do I want a coupon? Or to take another flight? Nah, a deflated cushion? How bad could it be????
Of course, its in fact my seat that has "malfunctioned". Apparently a seat can "deflate". Do I want the only other seat next to the toilet?
Then minutes later the attendant comes to the podium "Manuelllla Rossum? Would Emmmmannnuella Rosssum please report to the podium?"
I joke to a woman standing next to me, "Hope its not my seat!"
Standing at the airplane gate for a flight. Seems to be some kind of delay. Attendant says there is a technician working on 1 of the seats.
Ever find yourself standing in front of the top read junkie mystery novels and wonder if you've read them already and just can't remember?
@Memles Thank you for what you said in your review of this week's episode. It meant a lot to me!

So, if I've been on hold for 20:15, what are the over under odds that this guy is just not coming back to the phone......???

Do yourself a favor. See @funhomemusical on bway. It's absolutely fun-omenal. (See what I did there?) Laugh out loud funny &amp; poignant.
