The lipsticks are my absolute favorite! They don't dry out my lips and last forever #AskKristin #LOVEisON
Ahhh I'd say bold lip although I'm more a nude lip girl. The cat eye thing just isn't for me but I love on other women.
Stay busy! No social media stalking..cut them out of your life completely. Go out with your girls, get dressed up, and dance... #AskKristin
I wanted 2 look like myself-just the best version-so we kept it light-ish but loaded on the lashes &amp; kept everything neutral #AskKristin
Jay hates makeup and prefers me without any. But even when I have some on, he's not a fan of red lips or anything heavy (obviously)
We moved really fast. He told me he loved me after 2 wks &amp; that he wanted 2 marry me aftr 2 months. I knew right away! #AskKristin #LOVEisON
😊😍😱😖😂🔥😍🎉 had some good ones and some WHAT WAS I THINKINGS!!! 🙈
Theyre*****
We're both so busy and are always with the kids which makes it hard to have a real conversation until after their in bed
Light candles and put phones away. Take a bath (doesn't even have to be sexual..or it can!) but it's all about talking and connecting since
I'm looking for ideas! We're pretty boring and make dinner at home but wait to eat until after the kids go to sleep so we can connect...
Highlighting (I do down the center of my nose &amp; cheekbones) &amp; I'm a pro at putting on fake individual lashes now. Makes such a difference!
Sure is! RT @luvscolts: @KristinCav he's a Taurus, isn't he? :)
Which can put strain on a relationship unless u have a really solid foundation
Wanting to know about the relationship etc. also there have been MANY false things printed about our relationship over the years.
The pop culture world was all new for Jay so paparazzi bothered him (still does) and it took a lot of adjusting. He wasn't used to ppl....
Learn 2 B a good fighter (or less of one) by saying this makes ME feel..instead of YOU did this. don't be afraid 2 B vulnerable (hard 4 me!)
COMMUNICATION! You can't assume the other knows how u are feeling....more coming in another tweet..
U don't want to try too hard-minimal, neutral makeup that lets ur natural beauty shine through. Great mascara, bronzer, and highlighter 👍
The 2nd time I ever hung out w Jay we decided to go to Nashville last minute and had the best 24hrs! It was the most fun I've ever had.
