@downer_debs @raleighroo972 @marge_rhonj @Andy @BravoTV I’m not happy with him.  Let’s leave it at that.
@marge_rhonj @Aprilm1616 @nelicade @Andy @BravoTV Honestly, Blessed this child’s ❤️. May they be happy, healthy and loved. That’s all that truly matters
@Amberco1022 @mmshs2005 @marge_rhonj @Andy @BravoTV 😘😘😘
@marge_rhonj Im sorry, 😥 I do believe that people should be who they want to be.  I read it as a 5 year old going through medical treatment.  I thought that was too young 🏳️‍🌈
@marge_rhonj You’re just wanting to be nasty.  I was talking medical changes and you know it.  Btw my daughter does talk to me.   So get your facts straight
@marge_rhonj @Amberco1022 @Andy @BravoTV That’s not what I said!  I might be wrong but”Transitioning” to me means , hormones &amp; surgery etc.  I feel a 5 year old that hasn’t gone through puberty yet is to young.  Do you not agree ?
@nelicade @raleighroo972 @marge_rhonj @Andy @BravoTV You can’t have opinions now a days 🤦🏼‍♀️. I had zero hate, just saying 5 years old sounds to young.
@Amberco1022 @marge_rhonj @Andy @BravoTV That’s sad.  No one should be bullied for being themself.
@raleighroo972 @marge_rhonj @Andy @BravoTV Very ignorant statement
@marge_rhonj @1970Lissa @Andy @BravoTV I’m not supporting anything.  Other than a 5 year old is to young to make that kind of decision.
@Gochosuarez @marge_rhonj @nelicade @Andy @BravoTV That was my point, why do these bottom feeders have to twist my words?
@marge_rhonj @Andy @BravoTV Don’t twist my words!
@marge_rhonj This is Not true!  My point is  a five year old is not cable of making that decision.  That’s it!

@bowman_allie @vgunvalson It's pretty pathetic.
@shopgurl80 @MeghanKEdmonds It's no big scandal or fight I just chose to walk away from him. Due to his behavior
@shopgurl80 @MeghanKEdmonds He was not invited to my baptism &amp; he freaked out. He's all about the camera. As you can see! You find out who your friends are fast on Tv
@shopgurl80 @MeghanKEdmonds I walked away due to his behavior.  Only came around when I was filming. I stoped inviting him he &amp; wrote on FB he was going to destroy me
@collincoln88 @MeghanKEdmonds No he just wants to be famous
@Bunnie211 @MeghanKEdmonds Yes very very mean.  Be afraid. Very afraid 😂
@AnthonyC765 @MeghanKEdmonds Ummm we are not into that
@natural_chick70 @MeghanKEdmonds Thank you.  It was clear it was staged.  Worst acting ever.
@joydiane27_joy @MeghanKEdmonds 😂 I'm an open book
@carlosthebigca @MeghanKEdmonds She was being a good friend to me and shannon.
@chandrapntx @MeghanKEdmonds I don't have ex friends other than him. Never friends with Gretchen or Lizzy etc.  We just worked together
@MeghanKEdmonds Right! His attempt last night was confirmation that I did the right thing by getting him out of my life.  He's with the right people 👹now

Oh dear
I love me some @MeghanKEdmonds ❤️❤️

@lauraworrallomg @shutupbuck thanks.  I have my moments
@111Flisans keep watching.  Did you think I was off limits even though i was nice 😂
@cheryl_krager repeating what's said on camera is conversation. It will be seen by all.
@RHOC_KellyDodd @LouiseLa6 you know exactly what you did for the cast to wonder.  Don't play innocent #keepwatching #mybackyardisclean
@MykalsDiamonds from @MeghanKEdmonds she has a hat line.

I'm on #wwhl tonight!! If you tweet me during the show, @Andy might read them on air!
@regina_phlange1 @JackieSchimmel haha
@Travvie_Dearest right!!!
@HeatherDubrow @OhHeyyStephanie @dmonaay I don't know but I love it 😂
@soula214 you're twins are adorable 👫
@LALATE I was just wondering about the ratings  thx
@tlynnlion1 it's a joke. I've been called that for years on the show
@astrid_swan thx They have the cutest suits
@AngMay27 thank you
@missmellie2 no I haven't  thanks for letting me know
@EmmaCat12 @jojobeean right 🙄
@Normita_78 nope
@atlantablond thx.  I was out on a 4 mile run and just got back to camp
Difficult episode to watch. The thoughts of "what if" didn't leave my head for months. #jesusismyrollbar
@dmaxey3 me too
@DebbieGardo1 I had my kids. She needed to take care of them
@badgaliris78 @vgunvalson @Bravotv so scary, makes me cry every time I watch
@MrMussio @meggypotuk thank you
@nancynurse1968 thank you
@TSH1123 @meggypotuk right
@jojobeean emergency surgery sliced down the middle
@TSH1123 I got it from @MeghanKEdmonds
@BmoreBacheloret duh!  There is more to Glamis than going on a buggy
@jillolimpio she didn't hook it
@chadsbad @RHOC_KellyDodd she didn't hook it
@meggypotuk it's a joke.  Relax
@TheJellicoe I know I had one
@KelseyFilban @rosevincent love that.
@Amymillerkruse1 it was a joke.
@Rtmbtwentygirl 😂😂
@jimtalks no I hope they are smart enough to know it was a joke
@HeatherMcDonald @HeatherDubrow thanks for making the ride down my friend
@car0licious @HeatherMcDonald @HeatherDubrow you do know it's a real cake and not vegetables right 🙄
@EveJ43 @vgunvalson it's clearly a joke.
@LadyTeapots @annespo @Bethenny lol good memory.
@BigBlondeHair Bebe
@joyrosenberg @GregoryHuzar @RHOC_KellyDodd @GraceIn2015 then that make sense
@GregoryHuzar @RHOC_KellyDodd @GraceIn2015 yes I follow her.  Thought we were good
@RHOC_KellyDodd @GraceIn2015 seriously, Hire a team to go after you?  That's not true!
@astrid_swan total inspiration.  I love your suit what brand? 🔥
@milesmomma12515 thank you
@GrandeGiftsEtsy would love
@Artzmybiz speak up about what?
@housewifetriv rude
Vicki never said it out loud in front of everyone.  That was a complete lie!  It was in the kitchen just the 2 of them
@rvp062007 it's tv sweetie.
@HeatherDubrow that is true
@JohnnyBarrToons I haven't been drinking this season. So you are completely wrong
@TaraInUp it's a dress. From revolve clothing
@Graceful831 haha
@bmandi13 exactly
David all naked 😂😂😂 @ShannonBeador  pulling an @eddiejudge season 5
@Kate4ver 😂😂
@addicted_bravo true!
@BtheNettle we shall see 🤔
@daisieduke67 @HeatherDubrow you're joking right
@brian_conklin @HeatherDubrow it's like she was trying to get Kelly mad at Heather
@EptingTina keeping it real. If it's said in camera it's fair game
@chellie_6 😳
I never told Vicki that @HeatherDubrow didn't want Kelly going to Glamis and was worried she would cuss.  Exaggeration !!!
@Bozjovi and totally exaggerated
@The_Real_Ms_P by doing what?
@rvp062007 nope. I didn't know when Brianna's bday is.  As she has no idea when my kids bdays are
@Swire622 I did cuz of her teeth. But not because she looked like Heather.
@JohnnyBarrToons probably 😂
Loved seeing a flashback of my girls . Sophia is all smiles right now when i showed her. https://t.co/BIleTJizi9
@realmrhousewife 😂
Sorry Merv #RIP. https://t.co/atZbomNK1G

@FAMOUS1MC @ShannonBeador love shannon
@jmclaugh02 this had nothing to do with shannon.  Nina was the one going off on Kelly 😂
@samanthaweller1 @RHOC_KellyDodd @suannkhill so my loyalty should have been to Nina ?  What planet are you from
@laurie4552 😘😘
@RachannNycole @RHOBHFans exactly.  Thank you.
@samanthaweller1 oh you're one of them. The perfect Christian. News for you no ones perfect 😂. #judgemuch
@HeatherMcDonald it was crazy!!!
@pettit3 yes
@suannkhill truth hurts maybe?  I'd wanna know
@domsmom531 fighting started way before I said a word. There was stuff they didn't show
@jmclaugh02 not intentionally.  Just had to walk away and when they asked I didn't say what Nina was saying. That would have caused war

@missmeliss465 @RHOC_KellyDodd best to put everything on the table.
@jdpeterson801 @magatron1127 exactly.  It was worse at couch. You didn't see it all
@lissa1885 the fight in couch was much bigger and longer.
@cubanaeyez oh yes I said those horrible things.  😭😭. Shannon didn't say them, Nina did
@samanthaweller1 @RHOC_KellyDodd I knew Kelly and Nina was no one to me.  Of course I would say that.
@hoopnotic no I didn't 😂😂😂. I didn't call names and say gross stuff
@cdwoofter hypocrite much
@____hnt14_____ he does not get involved.
@DylanBarnett310 not cool
We won this thing? Really
@Heatherwertz no.
@Kate4ver lmao
@RealityAshhole i know
Drama ....watch Eddie walk away
Don't think it's cool that Michael stepped in
@samanthaweller1 it wasn't about shannon.  It was a guest that was talking crap
@AmyTosto @Andy if I was Kelly I would want to know.  I don't Nina and she was nasty
Her comments about Kelly were disgusting ... I was in shock
Hold on tight.  It's about to happen.  Wait for it .......wait for it  💥🔥🌪🌩
@lorianne627 pretty sure I asked her too
@dolcil joking
@b_tru_ I think i asked
She spiked it 😂.
@Karensclutter i think she's gotten and for the record I don't agree with you.
@RHOBHFans move on.  It's been 4 years
