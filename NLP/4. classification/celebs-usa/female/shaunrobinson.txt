Your competition isn’t against other people. Your competition is your procrastination. Your ego. The unhealthy food you’re consuming, the knowledge you neglect. The negative behavior you’re nurturing and you’re lack of creativity. Compete against that.
You must find the courage to leave the table if RESPECT is no longer being served.
You need to love yourself so much that your energy and aura rejects anyone who doesn’t see your worth.

@italkrealitytv @RustyNail624 @pao8705 @TLC Once again...we tape show for 10 hours. Producers decide which parts to include in show.
@thusharijaya 🤔
@sportsandwit Lol. Of course producers give questions. That’s what producers of shows do.

Your past is just a lesson, not a life sentence.
When you fight to cling to people who are no longer meant to be in your life, you delay your destiny. Wish them well and let them go.
Good Morning, sweetie! 😘 https://t.co/oQU03R1VYt
https://t.co/70Kw84NDi1
Today...Don’t settle for less just because it’s available.
It’s always better to spend your time with people who make you happy, not people you have to impress.
It’s amazing that some people support a business’ right not to sell a cake to a gay couple but, they have a problem with a company not wanting to sell an AK47 to an 18-year-old.
😘 https://t.co/Gkw92dUEzL
If you rise this morning liking yourself, that’s what matters. Anyone else’s “like” is extra.

And usually, @GretchenCarlson when they decide to retaliate against a woman, their “go to” is usually to call her “difficult”. Interesting, sexual harassers are never called “difficult”. https://t.co/7eGDEObsJV
@GretchenCarlson @MiraSorvino And, it's retaliation in many forms. The "Go To" attack on a woman is to all her "difficult".
@Ironsteph Will be an interesting show, I assure you!

@DragonTat2 @RASmiFraz Good idea
@MidwinCharles No reports of any injuries right now, thank God.

@InventionQueen Oh, I’m so sorry.
So many people have lost their homes in these wildfires. It’s so tragic. Please check on anyone who may need help. Hospitals are being evacuated. Firefighters and officers are doing an incredible job trying to save residents.
@RASmiFraz It’s horrible the homes that have been lost and people who are without shelters. We also need to check on those around who are vulnerable.
If you know of anyone who lives in Los Angeles/Ventura counties who is elderly or has breathing problems, please check on them. The wildfires have filled the air w/ heavy smoke for miles. My eyes are burning in my house and I’m dozens of miles away.
Don’t be jealous of anyone. Be inspired. Everyone has their own unique gifts. If God didn’t give you something someone else has, it means you didn’t need it. Be “Brand YOU”.
