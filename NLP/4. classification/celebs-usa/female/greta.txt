When someone you like doesn’t tell the truth, it is called “misspeaking” or “lack of candor”...if you don’t like the person, it is called a lie and if to law enforcement or under oath, a felony. https://t.co/s0aRoqMzi6
“Misspeaking” is like situation w/ McCabe; he got fired for “lack of candor” in speaking to the FBI..if we did that, it would be called a lie and we would be charged with a felony... https://t.co/s0aRoqMzi6

News orgs need not fear what their employees would say if the news org is honest and proud of its work and proud of how it handles its awesome responsibility specifically protected by the Constitution
I would trust any TV news org that would lift NDA’s and stop gagging its employees from talking...you know there is something not right when a news org demands transparency of everyone but themselves,right?I am proud of my conduct at all the networks;are they not proud of theirs? https://t.co/4mxgpjbXQI

I should add...I also did not have ‘command influence’ at CNN ..I left CNN in 2001 which feels like a million years ago https://t.co/u2LNQfa9TZ
My non partisan style at Fox did not hurt me-I was there 14 1/2 years and not once did they try to get me to do something I thought wrong. https://t.co/u2LNQfa9TZ
Note (in case you want facts rather than your wild imagination):I left Fox on my own. As for NBC, they need to answer for themselves. No one said I knew anything or had bad behavior there. https://t.co/0JoRwIM8Lo
I think the key is not a news org but the news person. Who do you trust to tell it to you straight and not shove a personal viewpoint down your throat?  There are many good journos out there..the bad ones can be loud and often overshadow the good https://t.co/H3uTD820iL
I just try to stick to the facts and be fair...I don’t take sides. I let the voters vote. https://t.co/zEpE7r9Nut
I don’t see myself as an experiment..I have had 20 plus years of success on cable (hardly an experiment.)They knew what they were getting when they hired me-facts, fairness,blunt questions and good manners. https://t.co/LKjoZWdQtY
I can’t get them all in one pic....they won’t stay https://t.co/FDQ11FeWdA
I knew zero. I was in DChe worked out of headquarters in NYC. If you believe the women at NBC who said they did not know about the accusations against Tom Brokaw and others, then you have to believe the women at Fox who said they knew nothing about Ailes.Can’t have it both ways. https://t.co/drFAQWy58q

I think journalists would be more careful if they had to pay their own legal bills ...I think corporate culprits would likewise be more responsible if used own money to pay for their harm rather than raiding shareholders money https://t.co/J7ZqZX0HE9

Interview has not yet aired....it was a tease to the upcoming interview (it was a taped interview) https://t.co/SHe90UhF0w
I think if news execs (esp cable) put a ‘no insult’ rule on its employees and booked guests that likewise did not go on tv just to insult would be a good start to improving the quality of news delivered to American people https://t.co/qxbHxt7piw
I agree....you should not have news be so unreliable that you have to hunt and compare and contrast but it has gotten to that..the frenzy to get it first,to get ratings spikes has poisoned some good judgment https://t.co/LzQW4cwssm
I recommend that you not exclude any news org (there are good people at every news org) but that you watch multiple news org but be aggressive in comparing and contrasting to get to the facts...facts are what counts and you have to hunt for them. https://t.co/1ZnmnuP8rt
So who is right? Scott Pelley or Andrew McCabe? If Pelley is wrong...CBS should apologize for starting all the wild reporting / comments etc. that this “news” provoked beginning Thursday... https://t.co/yUpa6USv2I

I find music one listened to 40 years ago in college (or thinks he/she did) as inconsequential to an issue like nuclear weapons in the year 2019. https://t.co/F3Lnygobku
Your disdain for the process (using term ‘circus’) is partly because media has been so disrespectful to the process and to candidates(trying to destroy them)easy for media as they are on the sidelines;harder to be in arena https://t.co/CzyIUTujab

Some is very corrupt..some is very honest. https://t.co/77MhWYhHIP

I don’t agree w/ this Rep (assuming quote is correct)..but if you think only Hannity is too cozy w/ someone, you are dead wrong...the echo chamber of cable news is diminishing its product and job https://t.co/li8bpXVDEi
Many have done likewise...I find online news orgs and local news not to have that fever pitch that is poisoning some cable anchors and their shows (both on right and left) https://t.co/ikL3bvh7dS
Chances are you are watching only one cable news net...and no matter which one you watch, the one you watch will say the other is lying or doing something sinister :) Cable has allowed itself to be diminished by willingly getting into these cable fights. https://t.co/Ogm9cq9ydU
Your tweet is one all cable execs should read to their employees to provoke an internal discussion about whether they are doing their best job for the American voter or not https://t.co/4jgaeBlx4d
It is impossible to reduce all the examples into one tweet w/ the limited # of characters in a tweet - and I believe we can bring back robust debate https://t.co/rCzmtB46IG
It is indeed true - it is much, much cheaper to keep people in a studio talking to each other and about each other than to send reporters out to actually gather news https://t.co/8KJ28RkCsp
Almost all, if not all, do it. I don’t watch the news to learn what one cable news anchor thinks about another but you sure get a lot of that..which is one reason I think people turn to online news, or  local news...to actually get news. https://t.co/kut8R5zFvL
It does tend to look a bit narcissistic when they talk so much about themselves/each other...press is only business specifically protected by the Constitution and w/ that comes special responsibilities ..and not just to fight w/ each other https://t.co/qVxMI6wRX3
I think the cable anchors watching each other so much and talking about each other so much has contributed to the rancor in political discourse and the division in the country https://t.co/VUE6WVc51b
I think cable news anchors (all 3 cables) spend too much time watching each other and talking about each other..should spend more time on quality of its own content to provoke robust debate https://t.co/FfHZ9eA7Xa

It matters that we journalists do our best jobs and that means to get it right and correct when we have not. Cable news is not a game or to inflame - it is a distribution (or should be) of facts w/ robust debate..examining how you do your job is a good thing https://t.co/5IJVlz2Yqn

I appreciate the opportunity since it provides a preview (7 hours early) of the SOTU and thus helps anchors do a  better reporting on the SOTU...(and you can ask questions ) https://t.co/TkmXsQlDj9
From all the different opinions about @realDonaldTrump ‘s SOTU address last night, I wonder if everyone watched the same one? :)
Assuming it was the anchors, and not the staff, these were the veteran journalists in news orgs,not newbies..you want potential sources to trust that when you agree to off the record,it is..and you don’t want to be tarnished by others who don’t abide by it. https://t.co/BzDmjv8IGH
There was no overriding urgency or importance to warrant any of the leaks and of course the leaks were of no great consequence, either...it just chips away at the honor of “off the record” https://t.co/HnY1UhvYVE
There were a few senior staff...and as anchors walked out..there were many in the press asking the attendees what was said (including, what was the menu :) https://t.co/hsSDqvCswa

BTW, I think this lunch has always been off the record w/ all Presidents...?? https://t.co/weMktvuuhs

Some people are deeply interested in politics..and have to work late shifts and miss events like this...so, I put the link up for those who follow me and may want quick ease to see. https://t.co/DCmm9nashY
Maybe it is the lawyer in me...but when you give your word, you should keep it, regardless of who is President...this is annual lunch and many Presidents have cordially invited the anchors..and sooner or later, a Pres will get mad about not honoring word and not hold these https://t.co/KxF4YlmTtc
I went to the annual “off the record” lunch at the WH w @realDonaldTrump ...less than an hour later,I read  leaks from the lunch. What happened to honoring “off the record” when it isn’t national security but just a lunch w/ a President to preview SOTU?

why would anyone care what some insulting person has to say about him/her? I look at the person doing the insulting and think.really? really you think the person you insult cares what YOU think? That is pretty narcissistic. I care what decent people think..not insulting people. https://t.co/QdaDJberpC
They don’t bother me...I think insulting and nasty tweets reflect on the person tweeting them, not the subject of them. https://t.co/J3EPK3Ytda
I agree-voters need to do their own investigation which is why I often watch on line local news for politics since local reporters know the community’s issues more than national reporters. https://t.co/7QmImFpdKz

I think the FBI should explain why....nothing like transparency to help us come to the right opinion https://t.co/qGjvksK6v0
judge released him on a signature bond so she did not think he is a flight risk..news today that evidence was seized suggest that the FBI feared destruction of evidence (of course he was under investigation for yr+ so you would think if he intended to do that,he would have)??? https://t.co/sRCNCmg3kj
Reports today that records were seized in the raid on Roger Stone - hence the reason for the show of force/early morning raid (rather than surrender w/ his lawyer during daylight) may be because FBI feared destruction of evidence
BTW, disagreeing w/you does not make someone crazy..maybe we just disagree .. https://t.co/uV9wpKpOBl
Take a deep breath. You are getting yourself all rev’d up. https://t.co/uV9wpKpOBl

Did they seize computers? That would be a reason would need element of surprise (fear of destruction of evidence) https://t.co/3hXuAQo51r
Just learned...on his signature...so the judge did not fear flight https://t.co/HBk7aKXVnI
So the judge has no fear of flight..so why the show of force and element of surprise? Why not have him surrender w/ his lawyer at FBI office? Are there more facts to this that we don’t know? https://t.co/xcx5fkQP1c
That means the judge did not have fear of flight... https://t.co/4xhpJ8oU6o
Are they 1/ going to the mat FOR Roger Stone or 2/ are they questioning the arrest procedure? (Non violent crime w/ no fear of flight..usually done by surrendering to FBI w/ lawyer without this element of surprise and force); these are two different issues https://t.co/vKz8n6ubkj
The diet no one wants to undergo https://t.co/AtZrmaSuxm
Did they seize documents? That would suggest feared destruction of documents if agreed to a surrender w/ his lawyer https://t.co/Vf1SZgqYRv
I read Roger Stone’s bail was set at zero..can someone confirm for me? (I am on a plane w/ bad WiFi and can’t research it but can get spotty twitter)
Did they think he would flee? That would be a legitimate reason..but then why was the bail set at zero?  (Or at least that is what I read it was...and that would mean the judge did not fear flight..) or fear destruction of files? Did they take files out of his house? @ggreenwald https://t.co/7syPXWGET9

Cleo’s. https://t.co/ymJYpZRf00
To the extent it is relevant...at Fox it is show producers who do these ‘lower thirds’ in the control room and often anchors never see them or know about them ..none the less, anchors/hosts are ultimately responsible for them https://t.co/utRXhhGakm

Why are you so cynical that you think this was part of some big conspiracy on my part?

I am NOT a star...if I find the cure for cancer, or do something incredible, then I will be a star..until then..I have merely been on tv w/lots of people behind the cameras doing just as much work https://t.co/1mUC766i9z

This is the response I get from some on twitter (this is Jake..I love him but he sure does not love me..I have visited him every week for 15 years and he still feels this way about me but I love him) https://t.co/AJ3n7TJJjT
Went on @travelocity to book a ticket..thought the AA flight was expensive..so went directly to @AmericanAir website and ticket for same flight and it was almost $300 cheaper ...quickly bought it

2 suggestions: 1/call their p/r department; or 2/ tweet about it and tag them so they see it and tweet until they do respond 3/ picket them (on public sidewalk) and using good manners - in other words,get their attention https://t.co/yHkhcy8Op2

I would think my credibility greatly enhanced w/ you because no sooner did I make that mistake on twitter that I corrected it in multiple tweets..tell me how many other journalists or news orgs do that.

W/ the cost of cable and w/many dissatisfied w/ cable, and w/great improvement of WiFi/live-streaming in last 4 years, I think this is the year local tv will give cable a ‘run for their money’ on political reporting https://t.co/oSezozr01b
W/cable costing $ and locals tv free,and w/live streams of local tv stations greatly improved...I think cable news will get great competition this political season to report on Pres race-cable reporters don’t have the insight or sources like the reporters living there.
I love progress..love technology but when I see this (below) my first thought: jobs. My grocery store parking lot no longer has an attendant but is automated...my grocery store has fewer people working the check out and has some automated counters. Will we train for other skills? https://t.co/dlyd54QO9a
W/ livestream quality vastly improved..and people watching more online,you will get great insight into 2020 race by watching the livestreams of local news in Iowa etc this political season-their reporters live and breathe the state news and don’t just parachute in;
Yes,very cold in Alaska..but I love watching the livestreams from local stations like @Ch2KTUU because cables these days don’t give you a variety of news and second, the reporters who actually live in a state,like Iowa, know the political news and people best so I want to watch https://t.co/XoXIcGumXO

.@CGasparino, I immediately corrected my tweet and noted CNN said no tip but as an aside,you, probably like I, have many times gotten tips by FBI, law enforcement, prosecutors’it is the job of journalists to act on tips and so I was not suggesting anything sinister on part of CNN https://t.co/m7mK2h4kAk

Check my tweets! I have corrected and corrected...what do you want me to do, wash your car? The story  is not how CNN got there but rather an indictment of Roger Sone. https://t.co/4NHRUvgLwg
This shows how fragile many are if my tweet, corrected by many other subsequent tweets, has started a conspiracy theory... https://t.co/gaD5NiochE
It is even being ignored by many others...people are cherry picking my tweet..yes, the first one was wrong but check the others that corrected it and get a full picture https://t.co/2EOJ13gBYS
I bring to this story years of being a criminal defense attorney ...it is unusual in a nonviolent crime that there is an early morning raid (and not surrender) unless fear destruction of evidence or flight or the prosecutor really does not like the target of the warrant https://t.co/IiFzWeyM7Z
Someone I have known for years and trust him https://t.co/CD5lHexFyA
The danger of twitter as the story really is the Stone indictment. .and the irony? Even if CNN were tipped off by anyone, (and CNN says it was there on a hunch) it is the job of news orgs to act on tips...and we all work our sources 24/7...and good for CNN for getting it 1st https://t.co/SqtRSwWlsA
CNN says it is not a tip but even it it were, the job of news orgs is to follow up on tips... https://t.co/M2LUN0uRgc
And as an aside...the story really is not whether CNN was there or not (although the video is helpful to understand the news)-what is the REAL news: the arrest of Roger Stone https://t.co/03XnGW0hry
I am told - by a good source - that I am wrong to think CNN acted on a tip and hence was at Roger Stone’s today...I assume thus that what is right is that it was fortuitous...that CNN acted on a hunch after putting some clues together (including activity at the grand jury)...
It is really bad to scare and hurt govt employees by Washington’s failure to the American people to run the government..but worse, it is probably also terrifying their children...their kids feel the stress of their parents and probably worry about money and food, too
I don’t think it is nefarious at all for a news org to act on a tip..I think it is the news org’s job to act on a tip. https://t.co/rBgJ9lTatr
Many ways tips are legal....but some are not - eg violation of grand jury secrecy https://t.co/3untSf2FDg
Two legitimate reasons for a raid - and I have no idea if these are the reasons for this raid or not - FBI fears flight of accused or fears destruction of evidence and hence need element of surprise. https://t.co/qEPPyboxPh
No, the public does not necessarily need to know how CNN knew to be there. CNN does not have to tell anyone. https://t.co/rP66jukZsD
It  is no conspiracy - CNN either acted on a tip...or had been camped out there (either is good journalism.) What is most interesting is why it was a raid and not a surrender. Fear of flight or destruction of evidence or prosecutors really not like Stone? https://t.co/zxPtxUzzWE
Grand juries always create intrigue and suspicion as they are done in secret so I don’t know what would be different about this grand jury meeting yesterday from all the others. ...maybe there was something different or a good guess. https://t.co/1ApMDoL7pV
It is news is why news orgs want to cover it. It is news org job. https://t.co/bpL5XRMIu9
An indictment is never a good sign for an accused...but let’s wait for the trial when we get all the facts.  An indictment is secured by hearing only the prosecution’s evidence...at a trial a defendant can for first time challenge that evidence and also present evidence if wants https://t.co/28x2ufZpCz
There is nothing wrong w/ news org acting on a tip...I was not criticizing CNN for acting on a tip - every news organization acts on a tip. That is their job. You got this wrong;I was not criticizing CNN for acting on a tip (I would have criticized them if they IGNORED a tip.) https://t.co/zavnl9bvy0
It was not dirty for CNN to be there....that is their job...to get the news....you may not like CNN, but this raid was news and every other news org would have wanted to be there to cover it and this time CNN beat the other news orgs to the news https://t.co/7TbS2f6LDb
It is possible... https://t.co/AHiFnNiUr5
Yes, I was incorrect to assign the tip to the FBI...there are multiple possible sources...more significant is that it was a raid (not a surrender at FBI w/his lawyer)-suggests FBI fear of flight and/or destruction of evidence or prosecutor really not happy w/ Stone https://t.co/7UxSnw2P2z
It could be a wild tip (FBI agent tells spouse where going to be..who tells friend..who mentions it at work to colleague who is related to or knows someone who works at CNN etc.) https://t.co/jwN7MhFbuU
Yes, you are right...and I am certainly not criticizing CNN for getting the video — they beat out other news orgs and this is news https://t.co/GS2Pq50cVL
If he goes to trial (and that is months off), they will most likely get jurors who don’t know who he is and never heard of him...it is big news today..but months and months from now it will likely fade and get a jury who doesn’t know of him https://t.co/7eWoBKxh8y
Possible....but just an appearance before a grand jury is not always a significant matter and even if knew he was indicted (which was a secret),many would have expected a surrender to FBI w/ lawyer and not a early am raid. https://t.co/mjviNqL2zg
any news org who knew this would happen would have been there...and it is not sinister that CNN was there..they acted on a tip (or they have been staking out the place but I doubt that but maybe)...if you get a good news tip, you act. https://t.co/5RiFKizUsL
I am not criticizing CNN for being there...they out hustled other news orgs...I merely noted that I thought they were tipped off (and you get tipped off when you work your sources which is part of journalism) https://t.co/EZdxuO0raL
Even if you don’t like Roger Stone(whom I have never met),he is entitled to a fair trial...and at this point, presumed innocent (like every other person at this stage) but you have convicted him in your tweet https://t.co/A4k4vzhNPQ
CNN may have beaten out the other news organizations ...other news organizations may not have been following this story as closely ..may not have developed the sources that CNN has https://t.co/B3sEi4Zce8

Or CNN could have just been staking out the place for days... https://t.co/sJdpJ8XVKM
They had a warrant...hence lawful arrest. https://t.co/N1X37xPZgh
Upon reflection, there are others who could have tipped off CNN ...others knew, maybe even Stone suspected it and tippped them off...as an aside, if I worked for a news org and had the tip, I would have sent cameras https://t.co/aSaiBZ4LNL
I corrected it...someone, not necessarily FBI...you are right, it is not obvious FBI..could have been Stone himself...or others https://t.co/H77XhJ999j
Let me correct: it is not obvious that FBI tipped off CNN...someone else could have tipped them off. https://t.co/e3yVoE6BcV
RE: Stone arrest. Before you get more information, facts, I would suggest you don’t jump to conclusions or take sides. Facts make a difference.
I had not thought of it...but Stone is an unusual man so perhaps you are right but I have no idea https://t.co/C5AiQTv4YS
If fear flight or destruction of evidence, you would not just ask to turn in... https://t.co/CGEKwnFcoX
I assume you mean “you are” — and interesting that you call me an idiot :) https://t.co/qfqhkddxtF
I don’t know if they have something or not...but I do know that the method of arrest can be a hint of something (fear of flight or destruction of evidence or anger of a prosecutor);also,it is safer to quietly arrest someone but here it was a raid and CNN was tipped off https://t.co/yNLcFmq4nB
Tipping CNN off so that it was there w/ its cameras is an issue worth exploring. https://t.co/FDo9jf0KsK
CNN cameras were at the raid of Roger Stone...so FBI obviously tipped off CNN...even if you don’t like Stone, it is curious why Mueller’s office tipped off CNN instead of trying to quietly arrest Stone;quiet arrests are more likely to be safe to the FBI and the person arrested
Weird that Roger Stone arrested in FBI raid early this morning rather than surrender w/ lawyer at FBI office...did they think he would flee? Fear destruction of evidence? Or did he make the FBI and Mueller so mad so that they did it this way?

And I think HR at other corporations should be concerned...if you hurt the shareholders wrongfully, use their money in a bad way not permitted, or if you are knowingly part of an effort to do so, you risk being an ‘aider and abettor’ https://t.co/C6yYGtWPWV
Consider this:if a company is paying zillions for bad personal conduct (and I suspect personal conduct is exempt from any insurance policy), the insurance rates go up and the shareholders have to pay that...so it is not cost free to the shareholder https://t.co/GwLHfiFeuT
They may be the largest shareholders but even if there is one share of public stock, there is a duty to that one shareholder https://t.co/sPf8KtOW0r
It occurred to me....HR works for the corp, meaning shareholders (and not execs) since SH are the real owners ..hence any time someone in HR helps cover up a payoff for bad personal conduct of exec or other w/ corporate money, that HR person could be liable in civil action

you should look for reliable journalists at various news orgs..rather than at entire networks ... https://t.co/0MtZjyLKMe
On another topic..one network invested 400 million dollars in Buzzfeed and you would think that Buzzfeed could with that amount of money hire aggressive editors to make sure stories are properly sourced before published https://t.co/EuVHYjjP5I
For journalists it should never be whether the reporter likes or dislikes the person who is subject of the report but instead be: what are the facts and is there any corroboration? https://t.co/6TtzEVcDhH
Anonymous sources who are known to be RELIABLE to the journalist  (and whose info is tested/corroborated) are very important to journalism..over use of NON RELIABLE  anonymous sources is very different https://t.co/PPlpuiNLmC
Since it was an electrifying topic,other networks should have done more investigation to source and hence report themselves;cheap for networks to just repeat each other and spike ratings than do own sourcing on electrifying story to make sure the underlying report can be verified https://t.co/adO03Pt1xI

Who do you think understands Iowa caucus best (and thus who you want to hear from most during caucus run up reporting)?
But of course broadcast networks, unlike Buzzfeed and cables, who repeated the Buzzfeed report are subject to FCC https://t.co/tQ3fOyO4mV

Buzzfeed and cables are not subject to FCC rules but FCC homepage says it is “heinous” to “tilt the news” https://t.co/tQ3fOyO4mV
I agree documents are helpful to confirming the truthfulness;I wonder how their editors let this happen.. One news org invested 400 million in Buzzfeed..you would think with 400 million they could hire some editors to make sure their reports are not just rumors(and false) https://t.co/6FgmVgWr9j
Is there a test on it? https://t.co/MLVevC2KKc
editors need to demand more sourcing (including less anonymous source reliance) on electrifying stories ...it is important to get it right and not be purveyors of rumors, or worlds, false information. https://t.co/4NAKk9DF9l
I have no idea. https://t.co/yMS1T3iBkR
journalists have a duty to get info for Americans and to aggressively scrutinize leaders but with that important duty comes the responsibility to make sure to get it right. https://t.co/w1rR5lTbxP
I think w/ the state of the frenzy over it, using “if true” doesn’t tell people to wait for all the facts, whatever they may be, good or bad for the President;good judgment in this instance suggests should wait until info confirmed or have more info and not just anonymous sources https://t.co/slGDkxOGdx
As a former prosecutor, I expect him to be more cautious as he knows better..he should tell people to wait for all the facts ..instead he lit viewers on fire with his statement (especially from his position)..using ‘may’ does not calm things down and tell people to wait for facts https://t.co/CAro5gQBcf

Are journos sometimes (often?) being used by anonymous sources to 1/ spread gossip/fake news; 2/to settle scores/drive by smear ambushes?
It is time for all of us in the news business to stop and think:are we overusing anonymous sources to the point where it becomes gossip and not journalism?yes, some use of anonymous sources is key...but when explosive story, should we not also confirm before reporting?
It is also bad for everyone else who quickly repeated it and did not separately try to source it; when news is explosive,it is not always enough to report what someone else reported..you need to source/confirm yourself; https://t.co/gakCcK2NmC

The overuse of anonymous sources is a big problem in journalism .. https://t.co/9FlQtdkNZS
Another fact you got wrong:I am “back on tv”- I’ve anchored a show on VOA Tv that broadcasts around the world translated into many languages (1 year anniversary next week.) I have interviewed many on VOA:Pres Trump,Sen Dick Durkin, traveled to Rohingya refugee camp etc. https://t.co/qdnB7Iu35h

If what she said is true, it is deplorable and merits reporting and good for her for reporting this. IF IT IS FALSE, and if she simply made it up, that is horrible and she owes a very public apology to the US Senator and so does her employer owe an apology. https://t.co/aCUwjUyfLK

There is a difference between having a strong opinion based on facts (and not just based on other opinions/rumors/guesses) and a breathless effort to push an ideology down a viewer’s throat. The former is good and important..I fear viewers are getting too much of the latter.

I believe viewers are smart and can reach their own opinions and my job is merely to get them the facts to do that..and it is insulting to viewers intelligence to shove my opinion down their throat-plus I could be wrong :) https://t.co/r8FuJVNQ31
I don’t think journalists should “take sides” - we should present the facts, the debates and let YOU decide..journalism is not a sport..you tweet that the problem w/ my posts is I don’t take sides -it is deliberate as I think you are smart enough to decide without my opinion https://t.co/qL40wQpnLn
also while FCC not have regulatory power over the cables...their home page says it is “illegal to intentionally distort” the news https://t.co/TcGCrTRZkc
FCC has only oversight over broadcast but I think MSNBC is at risk of FCC oversight since you can’t tell the difference between NBC and MSNBC since same anchors, same reporters, even my ID when I was at MSNBC said NBC so I think they need to worrry that FCC will look at them https://t.co/TcGCrTRZkc
I will only say this: I did an honest job at all 3 networks. I am not perfect(I am sure I made mistakes as I am human) but always was honest ..I never deliberately ‘tilted’ the news for an agenda or to keep my bosses happy. https://t.co/3kJaldLkb6

You should watch the news to get  information and to be challenged intellectually by robust opinion / debate...but if you are not getting that, the news organization is failing you https://t.co/eA58axHKiM
Only if 1/ I am wanted by a network 2/there are sufficient resources to do a good job 3/no dishonest effort to get me to ‘tilt’ the news (FCC describes that as “heinous”) https://t.co/ylcVToQvFZ
So why do you need to watch them if you know what they are going to say? And the reason you know what they are going to say is that news is now a team sport for many anchors and not ‘facts..whatever they may be’..and robust debate on those facts https://t.co/4SjDx9C6g1
Good for CBC...reporting on this important story tonight https://t.co/TYcvdYAl7J
For starters, news orgs need to lift NDA’s so viewers can see ‘how the sausage is made’- right now the execs gag employees w/ NDAs. News Orgs can’t have credibility when hiding ‘stuff’-transparency is key in journalism. https://t.co/S1IN35yQms

Did you know that the FCC homepage says it is “heinous” to deliberately “tilt” the news? Do you think any news orgs, or journalists, deliberately do this? It is one thing to make a mistake..but do you think there is more, a deliberate tilting of the news?
If @jonkarl ‘s sources are right (not just spinning him)..what will some reporters say about their past reports? this is why reporters need to wait for the facts and just report what know...not what want to have happen or rumors..to spike ratings or click bait https://t.co/igt9We1w5K

Whoever told you that was wrong. You would have made it in college. (BTW,if I were 18 today, I would go overseas and work and learn a language and do college on line. I would not do college on campus - w/internet, it is different world and different way to learn.) https://t.co/aFAo2jaiF7

I am rooting for him ..important  for his friends to check in often to keep his mind off it and to inspire him to fight..and to likewise check in w/ his family as they too are going through this with him..cancer doesn’t just hurt the victim..but the family and friends, too https://t.co/OBL2zKqT7E

Let’s have a good, fair, robust discussion..lets get HR heads of news orgs to talk about NDA’s..why gag employees in news? HIding something? News orgs demand transparency of everyone else..why not of themselves? #hypocrisy Start w/ tweeting @BillStrahan and asking him..
BOTH...if news orgs won’t release the gag orders, they are hiding something...news orgs are not like Coca Cola needing to hide the recipe for coke..there are no trade secrets in news business..just stuff hidden in the closet from the owners (SH) and they use the SH money to hide https://t.co/fTo7rrR5jZ
I think news orgs have a GREATER responsibility to the American people to be transparent since only occupation specifically protected in the Constitution...also great responsibility to their shareholders, too..instead of using them like a piggy bank to hide bad behavior https://t.co/VRz5WKKeio
There are many great journalists in cable news but some let the American people down https://t.co/apRNL0qhOD
I don’t think news orgs who demand transparency from everyone else that they hide behind NDA’s;there are no ‘trade secrets’ to be protected - only bad conduct and secret use of shareholder money to buy silence or get rid of bad exec w/ golden parachute https://t.co/M11BduQEK3
Bill, what do you think about HR heads who bury their heads in the sand? What do you think about NDA’s in media organizations used to gag employees so that shareholders don’t learn what is going on? Asking for a friend... https://t.co/ggO8NTnjKJ
As head of the HR department for a giant corporation that also owns media properties, how about lifting the NDA’s so it isn’t just you who can speak...there are many past and present employees who would like to be able to “just saying...” https://t.co/tL4A2wlu5j

Yes..a joke..there is always a reason but stepping back and looking at all of cable, even the one you might like, do you think that cable hosts spend too much time watching each other and obsessing about each other or presenting the facts and a debate? https://t.co/GyPVE0EO4L
Local tv does a good job of sticking to news https://t.co/j3B9dQKu8f
the concept of opinion shows on cable is good as opinion shows provoke important debate on issues but the fights between the cable networks and anchors/hosts (often showing video of each other followed by a snarky comment) diminishes the quality of the debate on important issues https://t.co/j3B9dQKu8f
And @EvaMozesKor , you are so very kind as so much was taken from you...I admire you immensely for your deep kindness and for also remembering those who have suffered so much.. https://t.co/kh7uD5obs4
Then she should tweet about nepotism and not gratuitously be snarky to me..my tweet was about how much I would enjoy the job as you could do much with it.....and she somehow twisted me into her fury about nepotism. https://t.co/uzdcJfzIzm
These cable wars are boring and worse, time consuming and thus denying the American people the news-this bad practice started w/ O’Reilly and Olberman and then others realized it spikes the ratings so now I think they spend all their time just watching each other so can pounce. https://t.co/2bjBi14mD3
The problem w/all (yes, all) cables wasting time watching each other and then trashing each other (and thereby avoiding using air time for reporting news) is that you have this (see below) and then the question will be: does Jesse Waters work for Fox or for Trump? https://t.co/k63Ujmaxky
OUCH https://t.co/G99Az1TJgv

I hold my self accountable...there are so many things that I did not report about or am not reporting about....I realize we can all do just so much but the question we should ask ourselves: how much are we really trying? Are we doing the best we can? https://t.co/wRFAwelo3O
