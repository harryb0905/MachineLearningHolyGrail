Olivia Colman gave (in my opinion) the greatest performance of the year and that acceptance speech was one of the best Oscar acceptance speeches ever. This woman is a, dare I say, a queen? #Oscars #OliviaColman #IBowDownToThee https://t.co/rhXCw7pHmH

@mrtimlong "Yes, I'm suffering, but is my suffering being captured dramatically on film?" - Me, probably, in a crisis.
@mrtimlong No, but still concerning, as I was literally running towards a camera... quite on brand for me.

“But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.” Oh boy. More tears on a train. ❤️🚂⚡️
What I’m wondering is, why’d Hermione tell McGonagall that she looked for the troll herself?Why didn’t she just say she was having a rough day&amp;needed a moment in the ladies room?That way, Gryffindor wouldn’t have lost points&amp;the only focus would have been the bravery of Ron&amp;Harry

@StellaMaeve14 Yesssss!!! And to be selfish, also a timeline where Julia and Fen’s beautiful friendship develops and blossoms more. Maybe this timeline???.... 👀 cc: @serathegamble @johnthemcnamara @alonsomyers
@lemonsand @StellaMaeve14 YESSS It’s funny you say that. The one thing I hated was the portrayal of heart transplantation. They sensationalized it in a very negative way. My bf has a heart transplant. Organ transplantation is a miraculous life-giving industry. And this train ride to London is LOVELY😉🇬🇧🚂
@lemonsand @StellaMaeve14 I enjoyed Vice, myself, though there was one element I didn’t like at all. And I love Amy Adams too. But you know what’s crazy?The first time you and I started tweeting together, weren’t you on a train? Well I’m on a train right now! Heading from Edinburgh to London Kings Cross🚂
@StellaMaeve14 Haven’t seen that one yet, but I felt the exact same way about A Star is Born. I truly don’t get it. There were elements that were great: Bradley Cooper’s performance, Sam Elliot’s performance, directing, cinematography, and a few other things. But DAMN. I was bored.

@HighKingFen @highkingelliott @houseatmurs It’s a deal..... I mean contractually, I probably can’t tell you until a few months after I know... but when we get to the point of me not getting sued, let’s have a glass and revel in the nostalgia.
@highkingelliott @HighKingFen @houseatmurs You honor us so beautifully and heartfully. ❤️❤️
@HighKingFen @highkingelliott @houseatmurs It’s true. The day I have to say goodbye to Fen will be a very bittersweet, sad day for me. My eyes are fogging up as I write this from the old pub I’m currently sitting in, in Edinburgh.
@highkingelliott @houseatmurs And if it makes you feel even more happy, Fen is just as real to me as a life-long friend standing directly in front of me that I can see and feel.
@highkingelliott @houseatmurs That’s exactly right. I feel the same way. It’s the type of real that can never be taken away. ❤️
Sometimes I get sad that places like Hogwarts/Hobbiton/Brakebills etc aren’t real. But then it makes me more happy to know that, in a way, that makes them more special. Because they will always be what your imagination wants them to be. And in literature, they will exist forever.
@thejamesingram @LAFC This is such a disappointment, especially since I’m really loving @LAFC. But not screwing over your own fans is a big issue for me. #LAFC

@la_wa I would LOVE to hear this harrowing story at some point in the near future.
@christinatwise This is perfect. I am not exaggerating when I say I have been listening to the La La Land soundtrack on repeat since I got back to LA last week. PS Let’s get together soon!!
@mrtimlong Imperious is literally the perfect word to describe both mine and Lady Purrsbury Duchess of Meowington’s (yes that’s her name) sense of power.

@theirishclark I'm reading the book right now. It's incredible. I have about a quarter left to go. Once I finish it I can finally allow myself to see the movie. 🧛

Sen Flake, please do the right thing today. If you vote yes for Kavanaugh, you’re telling the rest of the world that America will reward a man who assaulted a girl&amp;put him in a place of power.

@melh23 @thandienewton This is absolutely right and a very good point. ☝☝ (PS Love your Emerson quote.)
@thandienewton Absolutely despicable. This truly makes me sick. Thank you for bringing light to this disgraceful situation. It is archaic and a shameful display of legalized child abuse. These defenseless children must be protected from their own supposed “protectors.”
God, I love the way old books smell.
Physically abusing&amp;punishing children teaches them that u deal w your problems through violence. If the reason a child listens to u is because you physically hurt them,it’s not cause they respect you,it’s cause they fear you. Also,what sick adult wants to inflict pain on a child?
This is absolute lunacy. #TheGeorgiaSchoolOfInnovation is bringing back PADDLING. How is child abuse still legal?? I feel ill. It’s proven that spanking leads to anti-social behavior, mental health issues&amp;further violence. These sick people must be stopped https://t.co/wDXR0zV0fw

@ExileOnPainSt @FoxNews @MailOnline Wow. This is absolutely despicable. Can you imagine showing up at your job &amp; then getting paid to write a article that's sole intent is to shame a hardworking man doing an honest job? Shame on #KarmaLawrence @DailyMailUK &amp; reporter who conveniently went anonymous for this article
@MissBlackMe @FoxNews Shame on everybody who ran with the story. But I called out @FoxNews because they are a national news organization that SHOULD be held to a higher standard than gossip sites. Also, tweets are short, I can't call out everybody. And you are correct, @DailyMail did break the story.
Sometimes when you’re producing a documentary about whiskey, it calls for a wee dram at 11:30 in the morning. #ItsOkayItsForMyJob #SuperCommittedProducer #SufferingForMyArt 😏🥃 #WaterOfLifeFilm @wateroflifefilm https://t.co/IQmImrdtBE https://t.co/rKwHxl2LgH
Sometimes people have this idea that because they see someone on TV or in movies, that they must be rich w luxurious lifestyles. Most actors are barely making ends meet, working their asses off at several jobs,just so they can pay their bills, go to acting class&amp; get to auditions
The fact that some heartless woman took a picture of actor #GeoffreyOwens &amp; then @FoxNews did a story about it,both just to shame him,is despicable. I worked as a barista not too long ago when my career was having a dry spell. No shame in honest,hard work. https://t.co/MtCY4bfsAJ

@johnthemcnamara @Fex_don John, you’re a legend.
Did I say this was every man's fault?No I didn't. I called out ONLY men who commit sexual assault.But if me speaking out against sexual assault makes you uncomfortable&amp; then call a woman a cunt on the internet,I'd take a moment to self-reflect on your own defensiveness &amp; behavior https://t.co/g22xcsHDkp
@Michell13412892 A lot of men do!! Most men (the vast majority I have ever known) are wonderful people. Women also commit sexual assault. We need to be careful not to demonize a whole population of people, but hold the bad ones accountable and then move forward in the best possible way. &lt;3
@teamjupa @OfficialMelB You’re absolutely right. Women also commit sexual assault and it is just as serious and traumatizing for the victim. I don’t mean just men, I was just focusing on this one incident. But thank you for bringing light to the fact that women can be scumbags too.
Again, WOMEN (AND MEN) DON’T LIKE BEING TOUCHED WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. It’s incredibly dehumanizing &amp; objectifying. It is not a compliment. Men who do this just make themselves look weak, desperate, entitled, and ultimately, like complete pieces of shit. My patience is just gone. https://t.co/iUOplfVqRS
Just saw this old video of Louis Walsh unabashedly patting @OfficialMelB's butt on TV,then laughing it off when she very clearly stated its not ok. Men, your sexual assault is not funny. It is not a joke. U have no claim over another person's body #FuckOff https://t.co/nICEVurxVB

Just want to take a moment to say that if you're feeling anxious right now: take a moment, do some deep breathing exercises for 2 mins, do 20 squats, 5-10 pushups, have a drink of water, and put on some good music. I just did &amp; it worked for me. Make anxiety your bitch. 💪💪💪💪

@ScootScoot @MarleeMatlin @Mageina Getting tissues out ahead of time is definitely the right move. #TheMagicians
This completely silent 'Harriet' sequence is absolutely incredible. And I applaud our writers &amp; producers for going entirely without sound, it was the best and most effective way to honor Harriet's story. @MarleeMatlin and @Mageina were so amazing and heartbreaking #TheMagicians
@JasperLeor @StellaMaeve14 💕💕 #TheMagicians

So to prep for the drunk Fen/Alice scene, Olivia and I were going to "research" by getting drunk together and running lines, but we ran out of time before shooting. Olivia, I think we should do some retrospective research next season... #TheMagicians
@SummerBishil1 @MagiciansSYFY I love you and Margo so much. Both empowered badass women, in my book. #TheMagicians

I just need to say how proud I am of Fen for finally asserting herself to Eliot and being honest about her pain and needs. This poor girl has been through so much with no support and finally realizes that she has to put herself first. Self care is so important. #TheMagicians 💗

@hedgewitchs @hale_appleman I'm sorry, my log baby is the most gorgeous man on the planet. #TheMagicians
Here's a stirring photo of my foot next to the Shadowbat footprint. I had to sneak my foot past some yellow tape that the art department put up to get this shot. So I'm pretty much a rebel. #TheMagicians @MagiciansSYFY https://t.co/jyceT1Uic4

@LemonadeMag @MagiciansSYFY Get your sh*t together, Brandon. @Brandon_E lol 😜
I had SUCH a fun time chatting with @Brandon_E of @LemonadeMag about #TheMagicians season 3! We also delved a bit into the fact that I'm pretty much not hip at all and a complete 80 year woman at heart. Which I'm not ashamed of at all. 😋 @MagiciansSYFY https://t.co/oT6DOwDHv6

@moondoggy27 @JadeTailor @MagiciansSYFY I'm not gonna lie, Baby Groot was a HUGE inspiration for me in that scene. #TheMagicians
This moment of Julia and Josh having a heart to heart was my favorite scene of the first episode. @StellaMaeve14 and @TrevEinhorn are both so damn good in this scene. There's still a spark of magic, Josh!! #TheMagicians

@The_Georgester @SummerBishil1 Those are my favorite.
@SummerBishil1 Girl, Cheetos are life. I feel like you understand me on the most snackistential levels.
So many actors are being all glamorous and making beautiful statements at the #GoldenGlobes right now and I'm here sitting in my living room wondering why I ate so many Cheetos two hours ago.

With so many good cops in the world who actually want to help &amp; protect people, murderers like Philip Brailsford stain &amp; insult the badge. This coward should be living out his life behind bars and the @MesaPD should be holding him accountable. This is the face of a piece of shit. https://t.co/eOS3gF0gUi
In 2016, Officer Philip Brailsford of @MesaPD murdered Daniel Shaver, an unarmed &amp; innocent man who was sobbing and begging for his life. Brailsford was carrying a rifle with the phrase “You’re F—ed” etched into it. Two days ago, Brailsford was acquitted. https://t.co/x6q3bnu31X

I think @WalkingDead_AMC should do a Christmas episode.
This makes me SO happy!! Fen's allegiance is always to Fillory. Joining the FU fighters was a way to take action. Her duty since before birth was to marry the high king, it was never a choice, it was always her destiny. Also, Fen LOVES knives &amp; swords. @MagiciansSYFY ✨🔮🦄 https://t.co/nCtIhR4Wu9
@ChefQParis GREAT question. 😉 Hopefully soon!! I want to come experience your delicious cuisine!! Just seeing photos of it on Twitter is just not enough!
@proFarri I'm ashamed to say I've never been to Waffle House, I'll have to go. But I am obsessed with waffles. My favorite waffle places in Vancouver so Far are @CafeMedina and @nerowafflebar. Waffles are life.
@Neptunes_Net I want to read them! Send me a link to wherever they're posted! Thanks for your continued love of The Magicians!
@nadzkarimi It feels freeing. Expressing yourself through the words and thoughts of another person/character only helps you to get to know yourself better even. I truly love what I do.
@Neptunes_Net I LOVE that Magicians fans are contributing their own stories and creativity to our universe. They're a part of our journey. I want to read some Fen fanfic!
Still in my pjs drinking my morning juices. I'm gonna answer questions for the next 20 minutes! Any new/aspiring actors have any questions they'd like to ask me? 🎥  🎬 https://t.co/VohNArr9dt

@KyleGallner Me too, buddy. I just have to remind myself that most people are not monsters and there's a lot of good people out there who DO refuse to turn a blind eye to 45's behavior(both Repub &amp; Dem alike) Also comforts me to see men like you bringing children into the world. There's hope!
@KyleGallner 2 ...political affiliation is, we care about upholding our own integrity and protecting those who have been victimized. It makes me sick that people can get so wrapped up in politics that they will defend a man who brags about sexual assault and worse.
@KyleGallner 1 Yes, THIS, is exactly what I think whenever certain Repubs say we don't condemn our own. Are they serious? It just exhibits even further how willfully ignorant they can be. We just refuse to cover and lie for the Dem predators/rapists because we don't care what their...
@KyleGallner It's just baffling to me that we live in a day where we have to explain to adults that a person who is a rapist and a bigot is a bad person. I mean, Trump is literally on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women.

@ForbiddenFeyth It was real Eliot. Eliot could just see me in both places since he was having an out of body experience. :-)

@aaronsagers @serathegamble 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😍😍😍😍
@TNE_Scifantasy Hahaha!! Someday, someday.
.@hale_appleman Oh yeah!! I forgot about that incredible line!! And, yes, amen to that. #TheMagicians
@JadeTailor @johnthemcnamara Awwwww He is so sweet!! I am so in for more 4 square madness. Tell David he's going DOWNNNN next week. 🤗 🤗
@nevarren Hahahaha The real challenge will be to get me choke on my own hair again while laughing. You've created a new kind of journalism.
Bahahahahaha Oh my god, I just laughed so hard at this that I accidentally inhaled my hair and choked on it for a second. 😂 😂 https://t.co/WqGbbw0E1f
@KeethInk Indeed it is! Nice catch! Yes, we do things a little more humanely in Fillory. :-) #TheMagicians
@johnthemcnamara David is seriously the coolest kid ever.
@TheJoshuaButler The pleasure is mine. Let's make this trend continue. :-)
Another fun fact: That last scene with Fen and Bayler was one of my audition scenes! Pretty cool seeing it up on the TV. :-) #TheMagicians
@osuna_sergio @StevenVanGheem Hahahaha Sassy is truly the master of the psychotic/adorable double threat. #TheMagicians
Hahahahaha This is the perfect moment for that reveal. There's more to Fen than meets the eye! #TheMagicians https://t.co/4sJVe7AijG
@kurtzellner @JadeTailor @ArjunGuptaBK @SummerBishil1 @OliviaDudley @hale_appleman @StellaMaeve14 ❤❤❤❤👶🏻
Jade!!!! So many warm fuzzies right now. I love you too girl!!! #TheMagicians https://t.co/stTZ2En3QV
Fen was a freakin FU FIGHTER?!?! That's right. Fen and Dave Grohl go way back. #BuhDumCha #TheMagicians
@StevenVanGheem Couldn't agree more. I'm obsessed w Sassy and her sociopathic ways. And of course her associate @osuna_sergio #TheMagicians
Every time Eliot chokes on the word 'father' on screen, my real life boyfriend cracks up. #TheMagicians @hale_appleman
@MaKyah @OliviaDudley @JadeTailor 💞💞
Fun fact:Tonight's episode is directed by @TheJoshuaButler - Josh also directed me on @Twisted_Show! #ReunitedAndItFeelsSoGood #TheMagicians
@MaryMNation Running through waterfalls w @JadeTailor, food festival with @ArjunGuptaBK, drinking wine with @hale_appleman, the list goes on

@RPopBox @SummerBishil1 Let's be honest Ray, Fen did not exactly step up to the plate. #TheMagicians
I think we need to acknowledge how brilliantly hilarious @Riz_Manji is. #DontFuckWithTick #TickPickwick #TheMagicians
@writerly203 Yes! YES! A thousand times, yes. #TheMagicians
Fen grabs the knife!! And..... Fen does nothing... #TheMagicians #Useless
