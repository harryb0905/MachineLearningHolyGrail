Trump calls Dems socialists after a losing strategy of calling us the “far-left Democrat party." Use any label you want, but we are DEMOCRATS who support safety net programs like Social Security &amp; Medicare. GOP calls those programs socialism &amp; will pay a price for attacking them.

Trump makes mockery of emergency declaration. What judge would even consider it after President said he didn’t really need the declaration. How could any serious lawyer ever represent a client like this? Where are the cowardly Republicans? They must be replaced in 2020.

Excited that America has gotten to know Speaker Pelosi.  We thank her for giving so generously of her time to our podcast. Here it is: https://t.co/I2ayzXHmNe
Hard to believe Trump couldn’t get himself to give even a nod to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who protect us and worked without pay due to the trump shutdown. That was another elephant in the room.
Trump droned on &amp; on about a phony emergency at the border, but not a word about the greatest threat of our time: climate change and its disastrous effects on people across America &amp; around the world. Not a word of sympathy for the victims of wildfires, mudslides &amp; hurricanes.
Last night Trump boldly declared that America will never become a socialist nation. True, and we'll never adopt Hungarian as our official language. What's the point? #SOTU
Tonight @staceyabrams displayed everything Trump lacked: passion, compassion, intelligence, insight, hope, vision, and real patriotism.
.@staceyabrams talks to our families with strength and compassion and pragmatism. Feet on the ground. Love in her heart. Proud to be a Democrat.
Uplifting tonight when the focus is on individual Americans who are brave and strong and deserve better than a divisive president. #SOTU
Trump happy about a new missile race. As he would say...sad. As I would say...a gift to Russia. #SOTU
Donald Trump never talked to parents who had tragedy happen in pregnancy in the late term. He is totally attacking loving families and putting women’s lives at risk. But we know how he feels about women! #SOTU
Instead of $5 billion on the wall, we can put those funds to fighting cancer. We spend far less now. #SOTU
Thanks to Democrats, we have women shaking up the Congress and fighting for unity, not just mouthing the word.  #SOTU
Does Trump have the check from Mexico in his pocket??? #SOTU
If you want to stop trafficking from the southern border, do a better job at the ports of entry and stop kidnapping children at the border. It’s a sin to separate children from their families. #SOTU
My heart goes out to all victims of crime. Note the crime rate among immigrants is far lower than among the general population. All criminals should be held responsible for their acts, but it is unjust to focus on one demographic while ignoring the others. https://t.co/ZJOLYs7PpM
Really? a partisan investigation led by a Republican? Don’t you know that, POTUS?
The state of our Union is  a. anxious b. chaotic c. led by a clinical narcissist  d. all of the above
Our middle class bigger? Yes. So why did the Republicans give huge tax breaks to Trump’s billionaire friends? Because he could care less about the middle class.
Calls for bipartisanship a few days after he said Nancy Pelosi supports child trafficking and Democrats are radicals who support open borders. This Kumbaya has not a scintilla of sincerity.
As the camera pans around the House, make note of the extraordinary diversity on the Democratic side and the complete lack of same on the Republican side. This is not just a passing comment; it is an unbelievable development that has shown which party truly represents all of us.

I was thinking that Trump DID build a wall – his shutdown wall which separated the people from their government, and the people hated it.  For the President to keep another shutdown as an option shows his complete disregard for the American people he is supposed to represent.
It’s been 10 years since I voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Thank you Lilly for telling your story about how you did the same job as a man and didn’t come close to equal pay. We need to continue to focus on ending prejudice and bias where ever it rears its ugly head.
50 years ago, Santa Barbara saw the beginnings of "the oil spill heard round the world."  15,000 birds killed, untold numbers of sea creatures lost, 35 miles of coast contaminated.  Oil rigs don't belong on our coasts.  The price is too high.

Before anyone votes today, on the 34th day of the shutdown, each Senator should ask at least one federal worker whether they prefer a paycheck or a wall.
Witness tampering by threatening Cohen's family. Conspiracy with Russia to hack opponents' computers. Obstruction by firing Comey.  The White House is run like a crime family. Mueller needed. Congressional oversight needed. Starting now.
Angela Kelley doesn't have a rich daddy to bail her out and pay her bills. The federal job she counted on has been shut down by Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump.  And there are about 799,999 just like her.  https://t.co/o23Jo8LF43
The shutdown has turned into a crime – forced labor. Not in some prison camp, but in the crucial work of air traffic controllers, TSA workers, food inspectors, FBI agents, to name a few. Every American who ever needed a paycheck should turn against Trump.
When does a federal employee become "essential" and forced to work without pay?  When their work is something you want to jam through despite the shutdown.  In this case, selling oil and gas leases.  https://t.co/u1vwb0Ejim

Stinging from criticism last year for golfing on MLK Day, this year Trump visited the King Memorial for two minutes and some press photos. "Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity." -- Martin Luther King, Jr.
"I have no business in Russia." "I never had business in Russia." "I have nothing to do with Russia." That’s true for me and  probably for you. But Trump? He thought so little of America that the lies flew off his lips as fast as a getaway car from a burglary.

Trump ignores that most illegal immigrants come from visa overstays. His wall does nothing about it. His promise that Mexico will pay is baloney. His sorrow over murder is appropriate but ignores Americans who use guns to kill at a greater rate. Open the government &amp; do your job.
Message to POTUS: your coldness for people means taking food and health care and shelter away from our families who want to work. Open the government.
6 people on the terror watch list in 6 months tried to get across the border. Not 4000 the Trumpites claim. Not a national emergency in even the smallest country. How about spending the $1 billion+ Congress already gave you for border security? Open up the government. Yesterday!
As @GavinNewsom takes the reins in CA, he is ready to take on the fight, and I'm all with him.  His words:   “The country is watching us. The world is waiting on us. The future depends on us. And we will seize this moment.”
One thing we know about twice CA Governor @JerryBrownGov is that he has never been one to sit still. As he leaves office, it's good to know he will still be championing the climate change battle.  https://t.co/Kk5CHz8tCF
Trump says he understands what it is to live paycheck to paycheck. I guess when your daddy gives you seven million dollars it’s not so hard.  Open up the government!

Our Boxer Podcast dives into the needless shutdown and we interview a time tested brilliant pollster, Mark Mellman.  Here what he has to say: https://t.co/xjcagUexhe
When I was sworn into the House in 1983 there were only 23 women. Happy to see more than 100 women sworn in today, but we won’t be “representative” until we elect another 100! For now let’s celebrate this milestone: 100+ women as we mark the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage.
Congratulations &amp; best wishes to @SpeakerPelosi as she blazes new trails &amp; meets new challenges. https://t.co/7LXrFRJ0CS
Trump bragged about all the machine guns guarding him. Earth to Trump: The Secret Service is not being paid during the #TrumpShutdown. Open up the government.

Donald trump looking more like the emperor with no clothes. Hear why: https://t.co/ksPCX9OVrC
Promises made, promises broken! Trump promised that Mexico, not taxpayers, would pay for his wall. So when Mexico writes us a $5 billion check, we can talk. Meanwhile don't punish America’s taxpayers, workers, and the private-sector businesses that rely on an opened government.
They keep saying $5 billion for wall is small change. Really? We spend $8b a year on the entire environment budget; less than $2b on after school (with hundreds of thousands of kids on wait lists); less than $1b on research for breast cancer, prostate cancer, or colon cancer.

For the first time in my lifetime, a political party has given over all power to a president. In every negotiation on the many shutdowns, Rs and Ds were in the room with the president, regardless of party. McConnell's surrender shows the spinelessness of Republicans.

Lying is contagious. Mitch McConnell says Democrats want open borders &amp; next says they have supported border security. The truth? $5 billion is a fortune.  Let’s wait on the wall until Mexico's check arrives.  The best way to solve our immigration crisis?  Hint: it’s not a wall.

In 2007, I chaired the Environment Committee. Scientists told us to move on clean energy, or all climate records would be shattered &amp; extreme weather would be ordinary. A GOP filibuster stopped us &amp; now Trump and cohorts could care less. They should read the new report and act!
As I think of all that am I thankful for, I will add that I am thankful for Chief Justice Roberts pointing out the obvious to Trump : judges must not be partisan notwithstanding who appointed them. I think it’s a good lesson for the current Supreme Court too.

Every American knows gun violence is out of control. Idea: Pass measures now that are supported by huge majority of the people, such as universal background checks, large magazine restrictions, mental health assistance &amp; expedited court hearings for those fearing a family member.
So proud of our House candidates (like @MikeLevinCA &amp; @GilCisnerosCA) who stood up for gun safety &amp; against the NRA, even in conservative districts. They didn't all win, but they all served our country well. https://t.co/DXQ80mII6K

Beware of make-believe fear. In 1911 as part of a “caravan” at sea, my grandma came to America with my mom in her arms. President Taft didn’t send troops but sent helpful workers to ensure they qualified for refugee status. No need to be afraid of a people caravan in plain sight.

Earth to Trump. Seeking refugee status is legal. My grandma did it  with my mom in tow. We all welcome good people to our home and keep bad people out. We do it every day at the border with more than 20,000 agents.
The President’s enemies list was put together by the President. And yet he continues his rants because he thinks they will work on Election Day Let’s show him they don’t. #FlipTheCongress.

After voting SEVENTY times to end protections for pre-existing conditions, + suing to end those protections, GOP candidates are making tv ads saying how much they are fighting FOR this protection. Right. Pinocchio looks like a pugged nose kid next to these guys! #FlipTheCongress
Trump weaponized politics and attached names. The attempted assassinations were on some of those he attacked - all Democratic leaders plus CNN. Yet Trump can’t even mention the names of two former presidents! Another outrage &amp; more reason to vote. Nothing else will bring change.

I'm happy to join @HardballChris today with the latest on the Kavanaugh hearing.  Tune in NOW!
I guess Lindsey forgets that the GOP never even had so much as a HEARING for Merrick Garland and held him up for eleven months!!
What a difference between the two witnesses. She: calm and caring. He: hysterical and angry. Which one is up for the Court?
It's clear &amp; simple: #ChristineBlaseyFord wants the FBI to pursue the truth, wherever it leads. #Kavanaugh does not. #FBIMustInvestigate!
Just seeing that a man who voted against the Violence Against Women Act – Lindsey Graham – is showing his true colors. John McCain is turning over in his grave.
Durbin just proved that this is a kangaroo court and a committee coverup . #Kavanaugh is afraid of an FBI investigation and Grassley is terrified of it.
Watch the Republicans pin the blame for this disastrous hearing on their “female assistant." They knew if they had asked the questions they would be seen for what they are – a group of mostly angry guys.
What does @LindseyGrahamSC have against women? How could you leave that hearing without 1 ounce of sympathy for a woman who is clearly distressed and telling the truth about a sexual assault?
Here’s what we know: Sincere believable witness who is 100% certain that a belligerent #Kavanaugh traumatized her. No mix-up here. He has created a fake personae.
Freudian slip: Grassley said if the Democrats had handed over confidential information earlier, “the whole country would’ve known about it.” Then he corrected himself: “Not the whole country." Bumbling  doesn’t begin to describe it. No wonder they have a woman to hide behind.
Thank you, Dr. Ford, for coming forward. And all the others. We can’t have a man on the Supreme Court who has an anger issue aimed at women. We can’t!
In contrast, @SenFeinstein is calm, clear and has already made the case for a slowdown in order to investigate the serious charges of THREE women.
In his opening statement, @ChuckGrassley doesn’t show the least sympathy for the serious, painful allegation but he attacks another woman: @SenFeinstein. He is angry. What else is new?
It seems like a million years ago that John McCain rebuked a supporter for calling Barack Obama a radical Muslim. Now corrupt @Rep_Hunter makes that spurious charge against Ammar Campa-Najjar, whose first job was in church ministry. #FlipThe50th! https://t.co/vZAMAMjNIx

Simple question:  If you were accused of a serious crime, sexual assault for example, and you were innocent, would you demand an investigation to clear yourself?  Retweet if you would demand your name be cleared.

Republican Judiciary Committee is going against Committee precedents as it refuses to ask the FBI to expand background check on Kavanaugh. Even Anita Hill debacle included an FBI investigation + 22 witnesses. They don’t want the truth. They just want a GOP operative on the Court.
Refusing to investigate and giving ultimatums to the victim are no way to get the truth about #Kavanaugh. But GOP wants a trophy, not the truth. https://t.co/UucmTIgl3A

Senator Orrin Hatch, one of the lead "torturers" of Anita Hill, cited "The Exorcist" regarding her testimony.  Now he says that Christine Blasey Ford is "mixed up" BEFORE she ever testifies.  Once again, the GOP can't bring itself to trust women.

We can give health insurance coverage for Viagra but not birth control? People didn’t like when I brought this up in Congress, but there must be equality. We can’t stop fighting. https://t.co/WtqrRVORdM https://t.co/6wy2EjaZel
California farmers will be harmed my Trump's trade wars.  Is Rep. David Valadao protecting them -- or even protesting?  Heck no.  Let's elect someone who will.  Let's elect @TJCoxCongress https://t.co/IlRPkdkeuo

The Kochs know what they're buying in Steve Knight, who votes to give tax cuts to the rich, gut environmental protections, and take away people's health care. Katie Hilll can &amp; will do better for the people of CA-25.  https://t.co/d11IUBEoOA
Trump stands with the tyrants and against the democracy. No staffers at his meeting with Putin? Who knows what he’ll give away next. Thanks for the question @Isaythere. Hear if your question was answered too: https://t.co/WtqrRVORdM
The new head of the EPA is "Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist." Only in Trump's Washington is this not an oxymoron. https://t.co/jq8DHllKq7

Do you think our President is racist? 49% say “yes,” 47% say “no.” Really? 47%? We’ve never before had to ask this question - no former President has even close to uttered the atrocities Trump has. My fighting words are all in today’s podcast. Listen: https://t.co/WtqrRW6s5k
The federal government sets guidelines for schools on everything from construction to cafeteria menus. But preventing gun violence? That's a bridge too far for Mitch McConnell &amp; the GOP. #FlipTheCongress!  https://t.co/DJimb5d0sc

EPA Criminal-in-Chief Pruitt has a secret calendar AND a $42,000 phone booth for privacy.   What else emerges? Corruption of the worst order. Where is Congress?  Cowering in the corner while corruption grows like a cancer. https://t.co/TW0JGEXpRy
We have a crook as the head of the EPA. Where is Congress' oversight hearings? I served on the environment committee with Sen Markey, and as he says in this week’s podcast, it’s like the Republicans have put Scott Pruitt in the witness protection program: https://t.co/wAMASalmld
Fight back with us. We must work together and we can't do it without you so please reply with your questions, and we’ll answer in our next podcast. Whether you're new to activism or ready to take it to the next level, we want to hear from you.
Since we know Trump wants women punished for abortion, senators should ask what punishment does the Supreme Court nominee think would be constitutional? Detention with the border crossers? https://t.co/U7nRnFxrpx
A president who said he wants to punish women for having an abortion says he won’t ask a Supreme Court nominee if he or she opposes abortion and will overturn Roe v. Wade. He doesn’t have to ask. His list is full proof. https://t.co/yCmQv3hbR5
Don’t fall for Trumps phony act! The businesses he built his own career on were started with millions of dollars from his father. He doesn’t understand the American Dream at all. He is not a student of history – and that’s a nice way to put it. Listen: https://t.co/wAMASalmld https://t.co/cIHM8ntBax
“Martin Luther King had a dream. But Donald Trump also has a dream. And his dream is that there will be no more Mexicans, no more Muslims, an infinitely small number of immigrants...” Senator Markey's statement is so true. On this week’s fight back: https://t.co/wAMASalmld https://t.co/y7lpncqQ8w

Ever tried to gain access to a military base? Even as a U.S. Senator it’s a very slow process and with good reason. But is that the place to put 20,000 children? I guess so if you want to hide them.  https://t.co/vCKj7ZT0Iv

BETTER alternatives exist than housing children in tent camps at $775 per night.  Ankle bracelets, bonds, and case management all offer compliance at rates over 99%. Who are we paying, and why?  Follow the money, follow the scandal.  https://t.co/TSEb39FTa1
Just think about a hotel room that costs $775 per night.  Five stars?  Fluffy robes? In room spa?  Nope. That is the price to house one immigrant child for one night in a tent city.  Follow the money.  Follow the scandal.  https://t.co/SGkxym0ESz

Reading between the lines (&amp; based on her record) @RepMimiWalters is really saying we have to build Trump's $24 billion wall (which Mexico was going to pay for) to end his barbaric separation of children from their families. We can do better: replace Trump's enablers in November! https://t.co/aEWgYNISwh

Better to talk than fight. But we need more from N Korea than a vague statement, as Trump promises to stop military exercises with S Korea. The message: you can have secret nukes, starve/murder your people, and then get a pat on the head and a photo op of a lifetime from America.

As a follow-on to his attack on America, Trump formed a circular firing squad against our closest allies at the G7.  https://t.co/tQRCV4Qa7Y
With Trump, it's "Attack America First." Lately he has hit our former presidents, our athletes, our free press, our environment, and our fellow citizens with preexisting medical conditions.
The #BlueWave surging, @DanaRohrabacher's "big California win," two of CA's hottest House races, and Ego vs. the Eagles. It's all in this week's Boxer's Corner. https://t.co/N3JXMcKmMT
How does Trump punish Russia for interfering in our election in 2016? He Invites them into the G7! Appeasement of this corrupt criminal  Russian enterprise doesn’t begin to describe this move. In November, Resist and replace this Congress that does nothing.
After tense talks with allies in G-7, Trump focuses anew on North Korea. If things go wrong he can always accuse them of burning down the White House in 1812.  https://t.co/PV47Cgcs5B

CA can lead the #BlueWave in November, but first we have to get out the vote in June. Ask your neighbors, bother your friends, torment your family until every Democrat you know votes!
Under CA's top-two primary system, we need to get every Democrat out to vote in June so we have more Democrats on the ballot in November.  https://t.co/obEyJxu0QN
Trump wants to make the election all about immigration. OK. Everyone who thinks children should not be ripped from their mothers' arms should vote Democratic. #BlueWave! https://t.co/aDIY7Bfzxz

Which word best describes a Congress that will not counter this President when he attacks our values and our freedom?  Wimpy? Spineless? Do-nothing? Cowardly? All of the above?
The biggest story today isn’t about the irrational Donald Trump, it is about the wimpiest Congress that has ever existed that will not cross or counter him when he attacks our values and freedom.

This thing about Trump keeping his promises. Hmmm. What about that one to "Make America Great Again"? https://t.co/7bTJrm16XR
Trump's motto for the #IranNuclearDeal seems to be "If it ain't broke, break it."
Would you tear the roof off your house in wintertime with no plans to replace it? Of course not. But that's what Trump did with the Paris climate accords, and that's what he's doing with the Iran nuclear deal. There is no Plan B. https://t.co/SPrOhWoOYl
Do you really want to flip Congress from red to blue?  Then you really need to help get people registered to vote.  For CA, share this form, print this form and give it to your friends and family.  Registering is the first step! https://t.co/tMiyWN2E6k
It turns out the Trump political organization is a subsidiary of Russia. We need to take back our country. Resist and replace the GOP in 2018.  https://t.co/w1Z82xT1Cx
Trump's unilateral action against our world partners means that America’s  word means nothing, American forces are endangered, and tensions with Iran escalate as the deal to stop their nuclear weapons program is no longer in place.  Somebody tell me how this makes us safer.

Former Senator @RickSantorum failed our children by carrying water for the NRA, and he still fails them. Where are your family values, Rick? https://t.co/MYqPG9xUrg
Our children led us in a magnificent display of true leadership today. The President doesn’t even have one nice thing to say. He ran away from Washington, but he can’t run away from his cowardly failure to lead.

Trump called out "13 hardened Democrats."  What is a hardened Democrat anyway?  In Trump's alternate universe, it seems to be lifelong Republicans Mueller, Comey, McCabe and Rosenstein.  https://t.co/SYBhnfb0Z0

Payoff to porn actress; Trump confidante selling stocks before Trump changed steel policy; 1/2 billion dollar loan to Kushner family business, then a foreign policy reward. No special counsel is needed to see the corruption. GOP: where are the hearings? Resist and replace them!
Paul Ryan finally got upset – not about kids being murdered in schools, not about children being deported and ripped away from their families, not about seniors who need Social Security and Medicare, but about big donors upset about tariffs. Resist and replace the GOP.
Having so many candidates may be messy, but it's a great sign that Dems across America are ready &amp; able to resist Trump &amp; replace his enablers in Congress. https://t.co/sPOUcWCgvz

“How to Obstruct Justice” by @DevinNunes: 1) Release a spurious memo attacking the FBI; 2) Block the rebuttal for weeks; 3) Claim that both memos prove FBI bias; 4) Ignore the bigger issue: Russian cyberattacks on America. https://t.co/5e2bfzoH8H

It never changes: wounded innocents; devastated families; lost dreams. No change. In November we get our chance. Resist and replace those who offer only prayers and no solutions. https://t.co/w8FQBCnt3D
Trump's denunciation of domestic violence was the thinnest slice of baloney, made without heart or soul and only after he was forced. We must send a message of respect and caring for our fellow human beings in November. Let’s have a clean sweep. https://t.co/Gmv2KnfqY0
Ok. If any politician expresses their sadness and offers their prayers to the victims of gun violence, check their voting record. If they voted against sensible gun laws and with the NRA, vote them out. These hypocrites must be tossed out and our children must be protected.
Across America, Democrats have been flipping seats from red to blue -- 36 seats this year. It will take hard work to sustain this effort, so let's all embrace hard work. The secrets for Democrats are strong candidates and turn out. Period. https://t.co/Q51tettAGt.

California blue wave coming. Trump enablers down or out. Issa's out. Royce is out. Rohrabacher &amp; Knight WAY down in the polls. Walters, Denham, Valadao &amp; Hunter in deep trouble. @DevinNunes - you're next. We WILL replace the GOP Congress in November! https://t.co/buogY4rohO

Trump &amp; stooge @DevinNunes don't care whether the infamous memo is true. They want to devalue the idea of truth so no one believes anything - not the Mueller report, not climate science, not the clear fact that the #GOPTaxScam is a giveaway to the rich. https://t.co/1m24gDjatq
GOP is hysterical about a panel of judges protecting America from Russian spies. Is this science fiction? No. They don’t believe in anything with the word science in it either. Resist and replace them in 2018. https://t.co/w8FQBCnt3D
So what do we know since the #NunesMemo came out? We know that an independent court found a reason to continue tracking a suspected Russian spy whom they had already been tracking for several years. And that this suspect was working for the Trump campaign. https://t.co/mUK7cw5hmT
When someone protects a suspected spy over the FBI, that someone is unamerican. Talking about you, @DevinNunes. https://t.co/bFEsS85ecL

Could have avoided shutdown if GOP had committed to deal with pressing issues such as Dreamers, disaster aid &amp; healthcare. So after 3 days they did what they were supposed to do all along. Now the focus is on the issues. 80%+ of American people support the Dreamers. Get it done.

Hundreds of thousands of dreamers may be deported because the GOP Congress is paralyzed. They shouldn't be. There is a bipartisan deal to save dreamers, the best/brightest of our communities. McConnell wants the President to lead. Mitch: it's your Senate, not his. Do your job.
Trump's "Highly Anticipated 2017 Fake News Awards" were highly anticipated only in his own mind. But this is not fake: attacking the media is what the path to totalitarian government looks like.  https://t.co/fc0zeOECFH

Trump's art of the deal: wrecking months of bipartisan work on DACA by demanding $18b for his wall. #Dreamers can't be held hostage here. If @realDonaldTrump wants $18b, let him get it from Mexico or his corporate pals who got a trillion in tax breaks. https://t.co/aqvpcFG95B

Nixon: "when the president does it, that means it is not illegal." Trump's lawyer: "President cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer." John Adams: "We are a nation of laws, not of men." I'll stick with the Founders on this. https://t.co/oHZFf9UApx

What do you call a person who promised to lower taxes on the middle class, and then votes to raise taxes on the middle-class? A hypocrite? A phony? A liar? Answer: a Republican Senator.
What do you call a person who has made his biggest moral issue reducing the deb,t and then excitedly votes to raise the debt by one trillion dollars? A hypocrite? A phony? A liar? Answer: a  Republican Senator.

Biggest lie about the #GOPTaxBill: GOP cares about the middle class. Second-biggest lie: GOP cares about deficits.  https://t.co/lALFnxo7CH
Why will GOP senators overcome their "concerns" and vote for the #GOPTaxBill? Because cutting taxes on corporations &amp; the wealthy is why they're there - it's the reason they're Republicans. https://t.co/UW1jlRTDKR
.@TIME called recently to get my reaction to the allegations against Roy Moore.  Our conversation covered that and a lot more.  https://t.co/zqagxG9zQC
Trump is the master of distraction &amp; destruction: He tweets &amp; talks nonsense to divert us while he attacks our rights, environment &amp; health care -- and now pushes through a tax bill that gives to the wealthy, takes from the middle class &amp; working poor, and explodes the deficit.
.#GOPTaxPlan is based on a notion that's clear, simple, and wrong: that giving huge tax breaks to corporations will cause them to create jobs &amp; raise wages. It's classic trickle-down economics. But the only thing that trickles down in this bill is misery.  https://t.co/C01IWRYNq8
I'm joining @chrislhayes on @MSNBC, near the top of the hour at 5pm PST this evening.  I hope you will tune in.
Thought the #GOPTaxBill couldn’t get any worse? Think again. It will get worse every day this week as GOP senators work to please one special interest after another. https://t.co/H53CO7tdwk
Chaos is Trump's middle name. He thrusts his anti-consumer Acting Director into the Consumer Financial Protection Agency to destroy it. Uh, they already have an Acting Director and she is for consumers. Earth to Trump: every American is a consumer.
"At long last, have you left no sense of decency?" First said to Sen. Joe McCarthy more than 60 years ago.  No less applicable today as Trump dishonors Navajo code talkers, veterans and Pocahontas. https://t.co/fgmhgoVkcU

When are attacks "underhanded" and "nefarious"? According to Rep Dana Rohrbacher, it's when you tell the truth about all of his ties, dealings, and visits with Russian spies. 2018 isn't soon enough to replace Rohrbacher. https://t.co/R4aQZl7KKZ
What is worse for a President than bragging that you grab women by their private parts and force yourself on them? Proving it by supporting a child molester for Senate. https://t.co/gvZ8ruFam6

Who wins with the GOP tax bill?  Heirs and heiresses, corporations, retirement savers, retailers, shareholders, people with no children or deductions. https://t.co/1wLu9NOqak
Nonpartisan congressional experts (CBO) speak truth. GOP tax plan gives millions to the top, raises taxes on the middle, wreaks havoc on the debt, forces deep cuts in Medicare. Needed: a few brave GOP senators to stop this atrocity. https://t.co/GOzYwjuNqT

Endangered CA GOP Congressmen Issa, Rohrabacher &amp; McClintock voted No on the #GOPTaxBill. But with more than 50 years' seniority between them, they were still too weak &amp; ineffective to stop this massive hit on CA taxpayers. Resist &amp; replace them in 2018! https://t.co/w8FQBCnt3D
CA GOP House members Knight, Walters, Denham, Royce, Valadao, Royce, McCarthy, La Malfa, Cook, Nunes, Calvert &amp; Hunter voted to raise taxes on their constituents. We need to replace them in 2018!
It's not often that I praise Fox News. But Shepard Smith's takedown of the so-called "Clinton Uranium Scandal" is clear, concise, and true. So of course the Trumpites want him fired. https://t.co/bXGMHCckjK

.#GOPTaxPlan will blow a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit, triggering automatic cuts to our safety net. First on the block is Medicare, which would be cut by $25 billion in 2018. Next: Social Security. https://t.co/MOETB66Bux
Who do you believe?  The GOP or the heart association? The GOP or the lung association?  Don't pick the GOP! Resist and replace them!
The GOP is stealing from middle class to give to the super rich in their tax bill. Now they tack on stealing our health insurance!!! Resist and replace them.
How to make a horrific #GOPTaxPlan even worse? How about throwing 13 million Americans off their health care and raising everyone's premiums an average of 10 percent? Good grief!  https://t.co/gcfr62zX7z
Excited to join the discussion on @MSNBC this morning.  Join me at about 10:15 am pst.
Hey, @RepMimiWalters - Please explain why you're voting for a tax bill that will make THOUSANDS of your constituents pay more. Your silence is deafening. https://t.co/ovaQc7jJs3
NO MOORE!  Please Alabama, don't send a sick child molester to the Senate.  https://t.co/Jbt4xFf7TK
If this isn't collusion, what is? @DonaldJTrumpJr coordinated with @JulianAssange, who was working with Russian government to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign and steal the 2016 election. And Dad urged voters to pay more attention to #Wikileaks. https://t.co/LEdeFznOTh
There have been 1,971 United States Senators in the entire history of America. There are other good options in Alabama, and Alabama voters don't want to be known as the state that added a child molester to the Senate.
The conservative blog https://t.co/VwUiVZDID3 clearly shows how #RoyMooreChildMolester should be banned from public life. https://t.co/TRtfalwUSl
Beyond all the other problems with the #GOPTaxPlan, it would blow a huge hole in the deficit. So what do they do when the numbers don't add up? Keep shopping for an economic model that says 2 + 2 = 5. https://t.co/BaF9offXin

800,000 #Dreamers. 500,000 victims of #HurricaineHarvey. Congress should help them all this week. Call your Representative at (202) 224-3121
To the more than 1 in 4 #Dreamers who live in CA: Our state wants you &amp; needs you. We shall fight to #DefendDACA! https://t.co/Imr7xp7HjN
Trump is clueless &amp; cruel. Above all he is a coward. Punts #DACA to Congress &amp; has his "beleaguered" Attorney General make the announcement.
Question: Which words describe #DACA repeal? Hurtful? Unfair? Stupid? Harmful to our economy? Answer: All of the above.

History will show Repubs reached new level of hypocrisy when ending filibuster for SCOTUS nominees after they filibustered Merrick Garland.
Republicans can try to rewrite history but their treatment of Pres Obama's nominee was a filibuster of the first degree. Not even a hearing!
My heart is with the good people of Syria. I pray that this limited strike in response to a war crime will stop the use of chemical weapons.

Last year 4 million men and women received health care at federally funded health care clinics.  VP Pence’s vote will deny many that right.
Earth to GOP: Planned Parenthood does 97% non-abortion services. Not one penny of federal funds goes to abortion. #IStandWithPP
Republicans began in earnest their war on women on Thursday by ending protection for family health clinics and family planning.
As soon as Republicans control everything, they use their power to hurt women &amp; families, taking away access to health care. #IStandWithPP
VP Pence “dashed” to the Capital Thursday to deny health care to millions of American women and families.  It’s war on women.
How does it Make America Great to take away health care from women...health care they need, want and deserve? #IStandWithPP
Sean Spicer needs a rest. Doesn't he know he can't control head shaking from the press, just as he can't control a growing Russia coverup?
Making America Great: roll back clean air rules so kids breathe polluted air &amp; get asthma. Who told Trump air is too clean &amp; water too pure?
"Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive." Clearly Repub Nunez is caught in the web &amp; its dangerous for our country
Republicans say #TrumpCare is about freedom. It is. The freedom to get sick and sicker without healthcare.
GOP = Get Old People #TrumpCare
GOP = Get Ordinary People #TrumpCare
Q: What kind of people go to bed at night thinking about how to hurt the middle class and the working poor?  A: The GOP in Congress.
Every day Reps flail about to figure out a way to hurt the middle class &amp; help the rich is another day 24 million ppl still have healthcare.
GOP Congress must choose between Trump, who is threatening them, or the people they represent. May the people win. Vote NO on #TrumpCare.
President Trump can buy any kind of afterschool care for his grandkids, but he cares not for those who don't live in towers. #TrumpBudget

If you really see women as leaders you don't repeal the affordable care act, where discrimination against women is outlawed.
If you really see women as leaders you don't defund Planned Parenthood, which helps millions of women access health care &amp; plan families.

Donald Trump, you have made it clear that hate is the driving force standing in the way of America being great.
In 1st 7 days, Trump declared economic/political war on Mexico, Planned Parenthood, an Indian nation, sanctuary cities, press, immigrants.
As Trump dictates policy to turn away immigrants &amp; refugees, it's worth reminding that Steve Jobs’ father was a Syrian immigrant.
Trump should know how many American immigrants won Nobel Prizes &amp; founded successful businesses. Exclusion based on prejudice is un-American
Donald Trump, you have no understanding what makes America great: our openness to refugees who yearn for freedom and who love this country.
Memorable quotes on Mexico. G.W. Bush: “Mexico is our neighbor and friend.” Obama: “Mexico is a critical partner.” Trump: “They’re rapists.”
The last president to attack the press was Richard Nixon, and we all know what happened to him.
Saying the media should "keep its mouth shut" is dangerous and is an unprecedented attack on freedom of the press. https://t.co/oodrnkFwiz

I’m a proud product of public schools, from kindergarten to college. Public education isn't a dead end &amp; I’m shocked Betsy DeVos thinks so.

Despite on-air apology, Fox News' baseless attacks on Hillary are reprehensible and must stop. https://t.co/4mUAqOeReh
Let's keep the good news coming. @HillaryClinton's plan would help us create 10.4 million jobs! https://t.co/E8QZTxC5Do
We can't afford a Trump presidency, which would cost our economy 3.5 million jobs.
Democratic record: 15.5 million new jobs since February 2010 Unemployment dips to 4.9 percent Fastest wage increase since Great Recession
Donald Trump needs to stop lying about Hillary Clinton. https://t.co/mUVlydsUQQ
Do the American people need to know any more than this? https://t.co/qPZkjwseif
Under Trump, if you’re a woman, you could be charged more just for being a woman. How would that Make America Great Again?
Under Trump, insurers could cancel your coverage if you get sick and put annual &amp; lifetime limits on your health care.
Under Trump, no more protections for people with pre-existing conditions. No more staying on your parents’ plan until age 26.
Trump would repeal the Affordable Care Act’s protections for ALL Americans – seniors, women, children and families.
.@RealDonaldTrump just revealed his first priority as president – taking Americans’ health insurance away.
Anyone who suggests violence doesn’t deserve to be in the U.S. Senate. #NCSen https://t.co/sItHTgdD8U
Message to Hillary: We will stand with you against this last-minute intrusion in the presidential race.
This unprecedented interference - 11 days before an election - is yet another reason to vote for Hillary.
We need to take a stand against this 11th hour meddling in an American election. https://t.co/1PlcIJ8tBS
FBI review of old emails found HRC didn’t intentionally mishandle classified info &amp; no evidence that newly found emails are significant.
Only a dictator would say he will accept the election results on one condition – if he wins. https://t.co/sasbuEdtNd
Good thing he didn't attack Hillary's stamina. She was stronger, better and yes - presidential. #Debates #ImWithHer
Hillary grew up in the middle class. Trump got his dad's money and even with that, he bankrupted businesses and hurt workers.
Now Trump is going after the Fox News anchor. Is nobody safe from this guy? #Debates
Trump's constant interrupting of Hillary is almost comedic. She keeps her cool and is showing her patience and dignity. #Debates
Hillary shows her deep understanding of foreign policy - and draws a clear line against an American occupying force in Iraq. #Debates
Trump's suggestion that he may not accept the results of this election shows what a danger he poses to our country. #Debates
Donald's definition of rigged is when he loses it's rigged. When he wins it's not. #Debates
Comparing the Trump Foundation and the Clinton Foundation is a win for Hillary. #Debates
He says that he respects women. Then why has he called us “pigs”, “slobs” and “dogs”? #Debates
Hillary is making women so proud - standing up for us! #Debates #ImWithHer
Trump complains we are not making things here. Yet when he had the chance he shipped jobs overseas. #Debates
Trump says we will have trade but cancel trade deals and go our own way. Huh?
Hillary is showing her spirit, her toughness and her common sense. Trump is even grumpier than at the last #debate!
Putin's puppet outed. #Debates #ImWithHer
Trump wants to take away national protection for a woman's right to choose. Way out of the mainstream. #Debates
Hillary stands up for all Americans when she says she wants a Supreme Court that protects our families. #Debates
What's at Stake This November? Our Democracy.  https://t.co/IoNfHSqr79
Donald Trump's treatment of women is vile and unacceptable. So why is Marco Rubio still endorsing him? https://t.co/PE1WaDuTAj
Putin and dictators jail their opponents. So would Trump. Biggest shocker of the night. #debate
Clear Hillary win tonight. I am so proud of her. #debate
Thank you, Hillary. We are stronger together and weaker when we turn against each other. #debate
I've heard playground taunts at a higher level than the nastiness of Donald Trump tonight. #debate
Thank you, Hillary, for pointing out great priorities for the Supreme Court. #debate
We don't need a whining president who keeps complaining that he isn't fairly treated. #debate
She looks like a president. Calm, in control. He looks like he would rather be anywhere else. #debate
If you truly love your country, you pay your taxes to support it. #debate
He says he has such a great business. What about his bankruptcies and losing almost a BILLION dollars? #debate
Earth to Trump: We can't go back to the days when insurance companies ran wild &amp; walked away from our families if they got sick.  #debate
The Trump attack on the moderators is what you expect from a sinking ship. #debate

Beyond vile and disgusting. https://t.co/isgIESf9rp
Trump should ask anyone who has been the butt of a disgusting joke how it feels.
.@RealDonaldTrump's lame excuse that he makes fun of women just for "entertainment" makes his misogyny even worse. https://t.co/L5azLJbFTI
Pence did not hold up in the face of the barrage of withering quotes of his running mate. #VPdebate
The trust of women IS the issue. Pence and Trump don't trust women. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine do. #VPdebate
Pence is digging a deeper and deeper hole on a woman's right to choose. Kaine is standing up for women! #VPdebate
Every time Kaine quotes Trump's hateful rhetoric, Pence shakes his head and never defends Trump. Who could? #VPDebate
Hillary was fighting for her city and state while Donald Trump was fighting to avoid paying taxes. Bingo! #VPdebate
Trump has insulted women, veterans, the disabled, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants &amp; Gold Star Families. At this point, who hasn’t he insulted?
If everyone in America who has struggled with a few extra pounds votes against @realDonaldTrump, @HillaryClinton will win in a landslide.
Trump tells Cuban-Americans in FL that Castro is a murderer while doing illegal business w/his regime. #TrumpinCuba https://t.co/VHOfJqmJ60
He seemed bored and tired. Low energy, thirsty and cranky. She was high energy, knowledgeable and yes, likable.
Only one candidate was presidential. Only one candidate had the facts at her disposal. #DebateNight
I'm so proud of Hillary. Strong yet compassionate. Clear &amp; intelligent, and she respects the intelligence of the American people. #ImWithHer
.@HillaryClinton is right. Donald Trump founded his political career on a racist lie. #DebateNight
Prepared for this debate. Prepared to be President. #DebateNight
Why does Trump insist on talking down America? And pushing unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policies. #DebateNight
Did Trump worry about jobs leaving America when he was making his Trump shirts and ties overseas? #DebateNight
Trump stiffed middle-class workers and bankrupted businesses. That's the last thing we need as president. #DebateNight

Lucas believes there should be a woman president because "it shows that everyone has been included." Share your letter using #ToOurDads! https://t.co/b4UZ77FQSg
.@realDonaldTrump calling for expansion of stop &amp; frisk in black communities is your outreach to African Americans? https://t.co/iJcdDgMfQ4
Consider writing a letter to your dad -- or ask a loved one to -- and then share it using #ToOurDads or on our page: https://t.co/gKu6IM1IaF https://t.co/IP0SkSoaey
So I launched #ToOurDads, a project of girls &amp; boys writing to their fathers about the importance of electing the first woman president.
Their responses made me realize that daughters &amp; sons writing to their dads is a great way to spread the word for @HillaryClinton!
One day I asked two of my grandchildren to write to their dad about why it would be great to elect a woman as president this November.
How do you make America great again when you’re breaking America’s tax laws? https://t.co/3vY8ko9GTS

.@RealDonaldTrump – what are you hiding?  Are you hiding that your tax rate is lower than the people at your rallies?
.@RealDonaldTrump said he'd release his tax returns when Pres Obama released his birth certificate. Where are they? https://t.co/r8sJmwGsDP
Trump's despicable 5-year #birther stunt is not over. Neither is the controversy over his tax returns.
It’s time for @RealDonaldTrump to come clean and release his tax returns. https://t.co/oFLU45NkP1
Or he’s hiding how much he would personally benefit from his proposed tax policies. https://t.co/2sVKb6gEE0
Or he’s hiding that he isn’t paying his fair share of taxes – maybe even paying no taxes at all. https://t.co/42YEcNXPMe
Or he’s hiding conflicts of interest or how much he actually gives to charity. https://t.co/Ybd8ZJG6gn
He’s either hiding how much he really earns or that he stashed money in offshore accounts. https://t.co/9OuBGXaiQZ
What is @RealDonaldTrump hiding by not releasing his tax returns? https://t.co/hWPfZpTj5h
Mitt Romney wrote off 47 percent of America. @RealDonaldTrump one-upped him to 50 percent. #Deplorable https://t.co/jkzbN64RgL
Don’t forget Trump derided half of America - said they “sit back,” don’t do anything &amp; are carried by “other 50 percent.” That’s deplorable!
Dear Republicans - 22 million emails went "missing" from the George W. Bush White House. When are the hearings? https://t.co/7NuxNNVzkm
Get well soon, Hillary. We need you.
Does Trump also believe that women at our colleges and universities are causing the epidemic of campus sexual assault?
Trump continues the GOP War on Women by suggesting that women serving in our Armed Forces are the cause of military sexual assault.

Very touched by the thank you I received today from my friends in Marin County, who started it all for me. https://t.co/4Kh4wuVNtl

A vote for Trump is a vote for dangerous hate. #NeverTrump https://t.co/7PHzIXlDGn
Donald Trump talks stamina? Then why couldn't he handle a three hour debate without getting tired?
Do @PaulManafort’s ties to Russian oligarchs explain the Trump-Putin bromance? https://t.co/MI69bqJhpU
Inciting violence has absolutely no place in American politics. EVER.
Given his threats of violence, Donald Trump has forfeited his right to top secret briefings.
.@RealDonaldTrump cries more than that baby he kicked out of his rally.
Whenever he's losing, Trump claims the system is "rigged." Enough with the whining, @RealDonaldTrump!
This is what you get when you ask six guys named "Steve" to write your economic plan: the same-old, failed trickle-down economics!
McCain's former economic advisor says Hillary's economic plan would create 10.4 million new jobs. Trump's plan would cost us 3.4 mil jobs!
.@RealDonaldTrump's economic plan? Give trillions of dollars in tax breaks to people like Trump while lowering wages for working families.
Seventy-seven straight months of private-sector job growth here at home...and only three more months of Trump!

Maybe @realDonaldTrump will open up his speech with calls for “hope and change”?
Anyone else see the irony of the Trump campaign stealing lines from the Obamas, who they criticize endlessly?
VP pick is the most important decision a candidate makes. Trump picked someone with a right-wing record on steroids. https://t.co/MeZqsm0BGz

Nothing has changed since the @GOPLeader admitted that the #GOP will do anything to sink @HillaryClinton's poll numbers.
Why doesn’t @ChuckGrassley stop wasting time with political attacks on Hillary and call a hearing on Judge Garland. #DoYourJob

The Republicans selected their Presidential nominee tonight. Look who they chose:   https://t.co/rL1Szaudri
As Lindsey Graham said, either one of these GOP candidates would be a disaster for the American people. https://t.co/6TeYBg6VT7
The GOP will choose between two candidates who oppose raising the minimum wage – including one who thinks wages are “too high.”
The GOP will choose between a man who says “No, I’m not a believer in climate change” and one who says “There’s been no warming whatsoever."
The GOP will choose between a man who thinks women should have to carry the child of a rapist and one who would “punish” women.
Today the GOP will choose between a man who calls Mexicans “rapists” and a man who wants police to patrol Muslim neighborhoods.
When I need inspiration, I turn to @NancyPelosi. Humbled by her support. https://t.co/L5BC2bw4tI https://t.co/PHG8ikHRpy

Fiorina is only person in America to think HP-Compaq was "most successful" merger ever. Just ask HP shareholders, whose stock dropped 50%.
I predict that the latest @CarlyFiorina merger will be as successful as her last one.
Cruz thinks Fiorina will help in California. Maybe he doesn't know Carly left after she lost by a million votes?
Cruz/Fiorina= a perfect match. He wants to ship immigrants out and she's a champion at shipping jobs out.
Slogan idea for the Cruz/Fiorina "ticket": "Mean &amp; Meaner"
.@TedCruz talks tough on Iran, but his "running mate" was soft on Iran when she skirted the law to sell them computer parts.

The last thing we need is for the Democratic race, which we have been so proud of, to devolve into GOP-style mudslinging.
As the lead Democrat on the enviro committee, I have seen @HillaryClinton's passionate &amp; effective leadership on the environment first-hand.
Both Hillary and Bernie accepted donations from fossil fuel workers, and both care deeply about the environment.

.@HillaryClinton showed the depth of her knowledge, her maturity and her compassion tonight. She won hands-down. #DemDebate
It's time to end "Benghazi-gate" and stand with Hillary in the face of this shameful smear campaign.
The real scandal is how Republicans turned the tragedy of Benghazi into an attack on @HillaryClinton. http://t.co/0GRQCSr8PF
Clearly, we need a grown-up for House Speaker—vote for @NancyPelosi!
.@HillaryClinton is right to oppose a deal that would hurt America’s workers. #TPP
Fiorina says she feels “empathy” for Hillary. Was that before or after she accused Hillary of lying &amp; called her untrustworthy &amp; entitled?
Shame on @CarlyFiorina and all the GOP candidates for attacking Planned Parenthood, which serves nearly 3 million Americans.
Every GOP candidate is attacking Planned Parenthood, which provides vital services to millions of people. If they win, women will lose.
As @CarlyFiorina attacked Iran tonight she failed to mention that while she was CEO she sold them computer parts, which was against the law.
.@HillaryClinton taking on the epidemic of campus sexual assault. Another reason to put her in the White House: http://t.co/GsmBOYlyu8
Another shameless GOP attack on HRC. Don't remember hearing @JohnCornyn call for investigation of Jeb!'s emails or Trump's deals. #Enough
To walk away means war. Because without a deal, Iran keeps its nuclear program -- and we cannot allow that to happen. #IranDeal
#WrongThenWrongNow flashback: Dick Cheney predicts the Iraq War will last “weeks rather than months.”
#WrongThenWrongNow flashback: Paul Wolfowitz predicts the Iraqis will “greet us as liberators.”
Anyone who says let’s go back to the negotiating table after 20 months is either engaging in fantasy or wants to sink this deal. #IranDeal
I believe the #IranDeal will make the United States, Israel and the world safer.
So the way @realDonaldTrump “cherishes” women is with outrageous claims that they cannot be trusted if they love their husbands? #truecolors
The Republican primary is a battle over who can be the most extreme in leading the #GOPWaronWomen
They would deny women reproductive health care. Many would deny it even in cases of rape and incest!
They would end funding to a group that provides cancer screenings and birth control to millions.
They oppose equal pay for equal work.
.@realDonaldTrump's words about women are awful, but what about the outrageous policies of all the candidates?
There was no clear winner at #GOPdebate last night, but there was one clear loser: American women &amp; their families: http://t.co/uclkAZrRQV
Update: Trump is in the lead. Cast your vote for who you think will make most outrageous statement b4 debate tonight! http://t.co/rvDgkY5KWA
What's your prediction: which GOP candidate will say the most outrageous thing at tonight's debate? Vote here: http://t.co/WUUAqjgBPt
Maybe if @JebBush took his own advice and worked longer hours, he wouldn't be losing to @realDonaldTrump in North Carolina!
The 2016 #GOP message to the middle-class: work longer hours.
I’m so grateful to @HillaryClinton for focusing attention on a real threat to our democracy – voter suppression.
Almost 100 years after women got the right to vote, 2016 could be another year of the woman from President on down: http://t.co/ULRro9P0Uh
So honored to host @HillaryClinton at one of her first fundraisers in CA. http://t.co/yFSm6mxlIH
If this was strictly objective reporting, why would the author brief Republicans on the Foreign Relations Committee &amp; not Democrats?
Now Hillary’s getting attacked for a decision made by 9 agencies, even though the State Dept official involved says she didn’t intervene.
This anti-Hillary book is just the latest smear job -- full of false attacks written &amp; backed by the right wing.
As I said from day one, the right wing will hit Hillary with everything they’ve got. That’s why we’ve got to stand up for her.
I’m all in for Hillary, RT if you are too!
She put 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling last time. Now let's help her shatter it! #AllInForHillary
.@HillaryClinton is one of the most qualified leaders to ever run for President, let’s put her in the White House.
Let’s elect a President who has excelled at every position she’s ever held from First Lady to Senator to Secretary of State.
Let's put a champion for women, for children, for seniors, for middle-class families in the White House.
In 1920 women got the right to vote. One hundred years later, let's make sure there's a woman in the White House!
I find it ironic that someone who came to DC and immediately shut down the government now wants to run it. http://t.co/H4Z7Bztbaf
In honor of #IWD2015, I want to honor one of our most inspiring women: Hillary Clinton. Watch a new video here: https://t.co/6gGnDWPdYv
Thank you, @SenatorBarb, the Dean of the Senate women, for opening the doors of the Senate wide enough to let the women of America walk in.
Hey Rudy, why don’t you ask the millions getting jobs after the worst recession since the Great Depression if Obama loves America?
Hey Rudy, why don’t you ask the auto workers whose jobs were saved if President Obama loves America?
Hey Rudy, why don’t you ask one of the 11 million people who now have affordable health care if President Obama loves America?
Hey Rudy, why don’t you ask Osama bin Laden if President Obama loves America?
With jobless applications at a 15-year low &amp; 58 straight months of private sector job growth, no wonder Mitt took a pass!

If you care about overturning Citizens United and giving our democracy back to the American people, vote Democratic.
If you care about fixing our broken immigration system and bringing millions of families out of the shadows, vote Democratic.
If you care about clean air and clean water and fighting climate change, vote Democratic.
If you care about ensuring that women – not their bosses – decide whether they get affordable birth control, vote Democratic.
If you care about investing in the public health systems that protect us, vote Democratic.
If you care about raising the minimum wage and lifting working families out of poverty, vote Democratic.
If you care about equal pay for equal work, vote Democratic.
If you care about making college more affordable, vote Democratic.
If you care about protecting the right to vote – not suppressing the vote – vote Democratic.
It’s 11 days until Election Day. Time to choose which party is on your side.
Earth to Republicans: President Obama isn't on the ballot. But equal pay for women is. http://t.co/gG9iz8f6d5

Let's vote for our schools, our kids &amp; our communities by voting @YesOnProp30!
Prop 32 is a sham brought to us by special interests. Vote no.
Romney, who shipped a load of jobs to China, is now peddling a load of lies on Ohio TV. Voters won't be fooled: http://t.co/VSEn8mAW
Once again President Obama is pulling us all together in a crisis. Strong leadership. Strong President.
.@MittRomney owes fellow Republican Colin Powell an apology. R's never insulted Powell like this when he served under 3 GOP presidents.
Still no apology. But even a Romney-Mourdock apology tour wouldn't change the facts: GOP doesn't stand with women even when they are raped.
.@MittRomney stands with Richard Mourdock, @BarackObama stands with women. WATCH: http://t.co/WUCeoadl
I will give $50 to the charity of Donald Trump’s choice if he stops trying to make this election about himself. Who’s with me?
At the moment of truth, @MittRomney stood with a man who shows no respect for the trauma of women brutalized by rape.
President Obama showed he is a strong leader for the 21st Century, while Romney clings to the failed policies of the past #StrongerWithObama
The President was a truth-teller and the clear winner of tonight's debate. #TeamBarack
Sorry, @PaulRyanVP: No matter how hard you try, you can't defend the indefensible. #FactsMatter #Malarkey #TeamJoe
We are so fortunate to have @JoeBiden as our VP — someone who understands &amp; connects with veterans, seniors, women &amp; the middle class.
New #jobs numbers show economy added 5.2 million new jobs in 31 straight months. Thank you @BarackObama!
.@MittRomney: Big Bird &amp; Elmo didn't explode the deficit; Bush tax cuts, two wars on a credit card, and unfunded prescription drug plan did
Mitt Romney wants to go back to the future, offering America the same old disastrous trickle-down path that we cannot afford to take again.
Do @Senate_GOPs agree with @ToddAkin that women fighting for their states isn't #ladylike? http://t.co/yjjU8e7V
Thank you @ClaireCMc for being a champion for Missouri's families. Very #ladylike.
Attention @ToddAkin - Standing up for women, seniors, veterans, and the middle class IS #ladylike. http://t.co/Gaf6trTh
.@MittRomney should be running for president of the country club, not for President of the United States.
Does @MittRomney think seniors, veterans, college students and small business owners are not taking responsibility for their lives?
How can we elect someone for President who has such disdain for hard-working Americans?
Anyone who listened to @BarackObama's speech tonight should be fired up and ready to win! #dnc2012

.@RepPaulRyan believes women shouldn't have the right to choose, even after the violent act of rape or incest - escalating the war on women!
.@MittRomney has picked an extremist for a running mate who believes in tax cuts for the wealthiest on the backs of the middle class
This election is the clearest choice we've had in generations: Mainstream vs. the Extreme. The Mainstream will win.
.@MittRomney thinks CA is like Greece. Maybe he should sell his $12M mansion in La Jolla &amp; move to the Caymans? http://t.co/mN8PHlAw
George Romney, after releasing 12 yrs of tax returns: “One year could be a fluke, perhaps done for show.” #FatherKnowsBest

Did @MittRomney pay his fair share for our military, our veterans, our roads &amp; bridges? There’s only one way to know. #taxreturns
The American people need to know how many millions of dollars @MittRomney shipped overseas – along with American jobs. https://t.co/32HrAhSu
