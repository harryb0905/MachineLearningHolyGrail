@KimKardashian Since it’s an autoimmune disease, stem cells may help. I went to @InfusioBH. Also, to trying to stay as natural as possible with diet and lifestyle has drastically helped me. Plant based, all natural products, implant removal, etc.

@LindaHogan I really don’t appreciate your ignorant speculation and encourage you to research the Hugh M. Hefner foundation which receives 100% of auction proceeds. I was surprised to see that it was you leaving these comments, I always thought you and your family were supportive.
@DSChazelle dream director for a @hughhefner biopic 🙏
@Miss_Danzig @hughhefner @JuliensAuctions It doesn’t auction until tomorrow https://t.co/RxgGjWDWDX
@CynthiaRebeca We are raising money for his foundation which is why we are promoting the auction. All proceeds will go his foundation to preserve his legacy and first amendment rights. This was his plan. There are thousands of items we have held back for future projects.

@Tommydazzle @netflix I believe Lyme disease can be transmitted sexually. Lyme bacteria is the same shape as Syphilis and has been found in bodily fluids. Lyme can also be passed by blood transfusion and from mother to unborn child.   I do not recall a tick bite.  I never had a rash.
Does anyone else realize that Lyme Disease is a common denominator in the @Netflix series “Afflicted”? It was Netflix’s missed opportunity to help subscribers relate to ANY of the brave people that shared their stories and raise awareness for #LymeDisease 💚
