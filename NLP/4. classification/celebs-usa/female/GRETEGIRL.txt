@Shay_Will Nerd alert!

Someone is on trend with his hat game. https://t.co/9HtjWrfvCA
My favs! #oscars https://t.co/J3liTM2mTC
It just won‚Äôt stop snowing. Best year ever!!!!!!!! @SolitudeMTN
Is everyone sick ü§í right now? #flu2019
More snow ‚ùÑÔ∏è!!!! @SolitudeMTN @SkiUtah
Another 2 feet expected this week. @SolitudeMTN https://t.co/aeDgDVVmk9
@MooreMaya You are a true leader @MooreMaya
It‚Äôs dumping!!!! @SolitudeMTN
@MikaelaShiffrin @TeamUSA So proud of your skiing!!!
@schendrickson I‚Äôm poaching this list.
Who thought this was a good idea? https://t.co/SpMIkgKXdA
@jenhudak @XGames And fun to watch.
@andreagperez @mlo84 From @XGames
Final rant, knuckle huck was sick, but why didn‚Äôt you let any of the ladies partake?? @XGames
Hey @XGames can you let the ladies back up the pipe so we can watch some one hit wonders?
@FREESKIER @KristiLeskinen @XGames Agreed! Just missing Miss Zimmerman to defend her title.
And how incredible are these women off the snow too? Everyone seems to be going to university, reading, arts, you name it. #xgames
How many women are in the #xgames crowd? Tonight has got to be a record at women‚Äôs pipe.
@jenhudak You‚Äôre welcome Jen!
Loved the Discover More piece during #xgames I always wanted to know more about the Chinese riders. Xie Xie
@skiingrogge Obviously, I‚Äôm in!
Oh, snap! It‚Äôs about to go down. Double up Maddie &amp; Chloe #xgames
Incredible competitive career @thekellyclark #xgames
@skiingrogge We need to put something together for next year. I totally forgot we were going to do this.
Wow, just got home from skiing and now the #AustralianOpen final is on.
Amazing! @girlscouts @xgames troop at the bottom of slopestyle course.
Come on @spencerobrien give them, that, right, left ü•ä #XGames
@mlo84 Cutest selfie yet!
That just gave me chills Zoey @NITROSNBRDS #xgames slopestyle
@srozendaal I see little Steve to the right. Way to get everyone outside.
Next up women‚Äôs Snowboard slopestyle 11 am MTN https://t.co/gQ7FgqZL3E #xgames
@westerjacob @ozskier @EvanMcEachran @XGames @anna_borgman üëãüèΩ Hi!
You are going to be tough act to follow @thekellyclark Let‚Äôs bring the 12 ft halfpipe back. https://t.co/AvD7Oa9Mxq
@XGames Who was the first?
@XGames So much fun to watch. Thank you for the 26 hrs of entertainment.
@ThiskidTAYLOR @XGames Me too.
@anna_borgman I‚Äôm glad I can still count on you Anna. #xgamespeanutgallery @ozskier @westerjacob @sethmorrison1 @SimonDumont06
@phil_herbert Put it on LIVE @espn
@KristiLeskinen @XGames @GremaudMathilde So good and so much fun to watch.
Or this song... Boss - I Don't Give A  https://t.co/0deh40C9yR
@ozskier You‚Äôre such an adult.
Can someone please make an edit of all these jumps and put the song ‚ÄúRun The World‚Äù by @Beyonce please!
@anna_borgman Dream woman
Then @maggie_voisin with the dub 12. The other trick I always wanted to learn.
Yes!!!!!!!! @johanne_killi landed a switch dub as well. Sarah went for it too. Crazy ladies!! #xgames
@justinairplane Watching
I can‚Äôt believe Mathilde just landed that switch double. My jaw is on the floor. How are you so good???
@FergieCancade @XGames It‚Äôs incredible.
Oh, and I can actually call the tricks.
Women‚Äôs ski big air is so much more entertaining than men‚Äôs. They spin so much slower and steezier. And they hold their grabs longer. #xgames
15 minutes until showtime #xgames ski big air
@Delta Ok, I will write a complaint to Ed. He will most likely want to retain his loyal customers.
@suummerhayes Did they ever post it? I would love to watch it again. Best @GoPro moment ever.
@suummerhayes Ha ha üëãüèΩ
@Delta Wow, I have been flying on Delta my whole life and this is the first time Delta has not been loyal to me. I can assure you unless you make this right I will start flying other airlines.
@Delta Yes, can you please reimburse my hotel charges for an overnight experienced by my family on NYE because a Delta flight left us. I have a photo of the plane at the gate, pulling away.
Are you kidding me @Delta @DeltaAssist ????? Your plane left me and my family stranded on NYE. Was I suppose to sleep at the airport gate? You can at least pick up the hotel. https://t.co/bIdCs1BLfd
Women‚Äôs ski big air tonight 7 pm https://t.co/gQ7FgqZL3E #24hrskiwomen
@jenhudak You did great! That camera angle was tough. I didn‚Äôt realize it until the end either. It just looked like they were spinning more.
@XGames @SebToots That was sick.
There should be a HUGE prize for winning overall at @XGames It‚Äôs too confusing when people start to specialize in events.
@stalesandbech is my favorite park snowboarder. I want him to land his run sooo bad. #xgames
@XGames @SarahHoefflin @maggie_voisin Such an impressive event ladies!
@JWSmarty @XGames @CassieSharpe Such a boss!
Maybe someone should try taking their ski off and putting it back on in the air. I would watch that. #xgames men‚Äôs big air
Who‚Äôs going 2000?????? #xgames 1980 is cool but imagine a 2000?
Spread Eagles ü¶Ö for daysssss @maggie_voisin #xgames
Perfection Kelly Sildaru üíØ
Weeeeee..... I said the same thing @jenhudak #xgames
Bummer Mathilde and Tess, thanks for going for cool rail tricks and making it look fun though.
@Shay_Will @maggie_voisin Sitting in third. Huge double 12 at bottom and great rails. Clean up grabs.
I‚Äôm so exited to see your edit too @maggie_voisin #powpow #flipflip
Yeah @maggie_voisin !!!!
Kelly is a machine. #xgames
Oh! My bad. @johanne_killi is competing and she‚Äôs ripping. I can‚Äôt wait for her 3rd run.
I miss the Norwegian ladies though @tirilsjaastad @johanne_killi
@SarahHoefflin has a nice flow going on in the jib section. I hope she gets her jumps next run.
Women‚Äôs ski slope is live https://t.co/gQ7FgqZL3E
@sethmorrison1 I think the intensity of the coaches ontop of the halfpipe was the craziest part. That is new. We didn‚Äôt have that.
Great show #xgames  Congrats to @CassieSharpe @alexferreiraski and the @NITROSNBRDS young guns! Laurie and Zoe
@ozskier @EvanMcEachran @XGames Where are you tonight? @anna_borgman @westerjacob #xgames
Jamie you are incredible.
I have that snowboard! @NITROSNBRDS women‚Äôs big air #xgames
Women‚Äôs Snowboard big air is going off right now #xgames live on @Espn
@jgn1010 I‚Äôm seeing the same thing this year. Who is responsible?
Way to put it down guys in #xgames men‚Äôs halfpipe. I wish everyone could‚Äôve landed their runs.
üëë https://t.co/SQpXwMGQzk
Yeahhhhh @CassieSharpe amplitude should always win!
Cassie wins! My thoughts.
I wish I could do an alley pop flat 5. #davecrighton
Yes!!!! @AyanaOnozuka beautiful mute grab!
But I like the webcast, just sayin.
@canrugger @XGames Another great name!
Why is women‚Äôs ski halfpipe not on @Espn @XGames again? Is this the 16th year??
I wish there was an @XGames spring jam for all us Grandmas.
Woahhhh Rachael Karker steeze and huge!
@Shay_Will They are all great.
You should get extra points for dance moves #XGames @TheEllenShow
Cassie vs Kelly tonight #XGames
I love watching @AyanaOnozuka in the halfpipe. She is going to go soo BIG on the #freerideworldtour
Refresh, there it is.
Ok üíØ
@canrugger I like that.
Ok, I‚Äôm going to do sit ups until this comes on #xgames 8 min abs
What‚Äôs the word for a blog podcast?
I‚Äôm literally watching the minutes countdown on https://t.co/gQ7FgqZL3E for women‚Äôs ski superpipe. 12:50 sec. to go
@skiingrogge @SalMasekela He‚Äôs the best!
Who‚Äôs skiing with @LilTunechi at #xgames this weekend? I know @BunBTrillOG would get out there.
@skiingrogge I knew he was in Utah for a bit but I didn‚Äôt realize he was a skier.
@skiingrogge Yikes!
@skiingrogge Can you elaborate? I‚Äôm already scared to know.
Women‚Äôs ski superpipe starts at 5:30 pm Mountain #XGames
I‚Äôm excited for women‚Äôs ski superpipe tonight. I haven‚Äôt watched a HP contest yet this year so I‚Äôm sure I will be blown away. #XGames
Is this the first time #xgames has been sponsored by an alcohol üç∫ company? Is the demo older now, what are the kids watching?
PSI: I will be tweeting a lot this week while watching @XGames
It‚Äôs snowing again @SolitudeMTN
It really snowed 3+ feet this week.
Is it really about to snow 3 feet!!? @SkiUtah @SolitudeMTN
Extending a warm welcome to the new @WomensSportsFdn President, @eamslider24! Elana will spend the next year working with the Foundation to strengthen and expand opportunities for all girls and all women in all sports! ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/7voFcPjabb
Thank you #RedbullFlyGirls for an incredibly fun time @iFLYUS and for bringing us together. https://t.co/4qornM4XRE
@Shay_Will @lasse_andersen @stalesandbech They sell it in Utah, it‚Äôs called Ski Queen.
@Shay_Will What does it mean?
Why does @Delta never wait for me?? Missed my connection by 2 minutes because of another @DeltaAssist delayed flight. #rude https://t.co/K7F1lzmusH
Watching @espn @NCAAVolleyball üëèüèº great intros!
Update. Gluten free did not go great today. I started my day with crepes @suummerhayes
Golfer hat tan lines are way gnarlier than goggle tans.
Yesterday...... @SolitudeMTN @TorahBright https://t.co/GiUBI7P7M3
Ok day 1 was a little rough. I ate a graham cracker and pasta. But I did eat a considerable amount or vegetables. Here's to tomo! #cleangut
I'm already regretting this decision.
I'm trying to say goodbye to gluten. Day 1 #cleangut I think I'm already getting the sweats.
Super unimpressed with @NBCSports today. They literally played the entire men's ski halfpipe final and showed one women's ski final run. #CopperGP
@SebToots This is so awesome!
Congrats to @MikaelaShiffrin and @RagMow on the #LakeLouise #SuperG race yesterday. And who saw that air bag under the race suit?
@kfiocco @BoltonValley I'm on latte kick now too.
@trennonpaynter @KristiLeskinen It might've been the year Andreas started dropping into the pipe switch too. He got robbed at X but I think did well there.
@trennonpaynter @KristiLeskinen The real question is, why was there no women's ski slope style  during Gravity Games? I remember Simon and possibly Peter doing well in pipe.
@soggysombrero Tour up @BrightonResort
@soggysombrero Thank you! It was sweet.
@AndiaWinslow It was like breathing.
Yup! Still got it. @volklskis @DalbelloSkiBoot https://t.co/8qBgcvCc10
About to take my first turns of the year. ü§û Hopefully, I still got it. So excited!!!
@ScoutBassett Hardest worker I know. Go Scout!
@kfiocco I do.

Sooo close @RagMow !!!!! So much fun to watch you. Congrats on your 2nd. @Skiforbundet
It's snowing!!!! #finally @SolitudeMTN @BrightonResort
@MICHAELBRIAN1 Thank you!
Where on television can I watch ski racing?
The first time I have ever wondered while watching a skier, "Where is he going to go?" That last run. https://t.co/TkJLNUucA2
Where is the snow? ü¶É Run + Ski or will it just be a run this year?
Open your mind people, Women Can Coach: https://t.co/BcR7AtNqDP
@LChamberlain44 It made me be so creative.
@Shay_Will Go Utes! Game day this Saturday vs Buffs

Watching @NautiqueBoats #NautiqueMasters women's wakeboard semi final - I can't wait to get on the water.
@trennonpaynter Air.
Yeah Haley Moore! Way to handle the pressure. #NCAAGolf
@adeibold Same, because they have a Norwegian. It's relatable golf, even though they are all super good.
Who else is watching #NCAAGolf ?
@theddeadshow @nick_russelll Such a boss.
RIP Carol Mann @LPGA - thank you for paving the way for us ladies to play golf. https://t.co/DQnvyfErom

@jessmendoza @LEEandLOW Cool!
@SaloMom @SPANX @SPANX you very much!

@JessicaLong Kegels

@CrtvPrdx I know where that is. Just waiting on the ice to melt.
Light snow falling on @SolitudeMTN I can't believe the season is over. Now, where are my golf clubs?
Ah, snap I wanted to see more of @JamieAsnow dancing. #DWTS I'm excited to see more @JennieFinch too, but if you boot her, I'm out.
@Shay_Will @worth_winning @LaurynCwilliams Wait, I thought you recommended this one?
Just picked up a new book "The Buried Giant" and downloaded a new podcast @worth_winning by @LaurynCwilliams
Even though I just waxed all my skis with warm @WendPerformance to put my skis away for the season.
I'd be alright with it snowing again. #springskiing
@Shay_Will I'm still working on your 2017 list.
Happy #EarthDay !!!! Closing day @BrightonResort too. #springskiing
@Shay_Will That movie was awesome when it came out.
My pop tart burned in the toaster, so I took that as a sign I should make an egg sandwich and spinach smoothie.
It seems like it always snows on #TaxDay
I missed @Eminem and @drdre at #coachella I might need to go now.
@schendrickson Seen it!
Who remembers what a burn folder is? #DVD
Watching @UtahRoyalsFC and knitting at home. #femalefan #soccerrocker
It's not over yet! It's dumping @SolitudeMTN right now. #sprung
Here's a reason to log onto FB - üîé PLAY IX and learn about the rights that Title IX protects in sports. https://t.co/HCZ84JkWFp
Senator, FB failed when we invited Grandmas to join and when we implemented timeline.
@schendrickson Yes!
@LChamberlain44 Maybe magnesium deficiency or you're pregnant!
Facebook is dead.
It's snowing again. Spring powder is here. @SolitudeMTN
I just learned how to run iMovie from an external hd. #technology #techie
Congratulations @pernillagolf @ANAinspiration champion that was incredible! Great playoff to you and Park.
I need a @pernillagolf @PingTour  golf visor.
@ANNIKA59 @ANAinspiration @InbeePark @pernillagolf This is so much fun to watch.
Back up this morning and the playoff is still on #ANAChampionship @LPGA
Watching the #AnaChampionship @LPGA on @GolfChannel this playoff is unreal.
It was a beautiful bluebird day @SolitudeMTN I think the sun is here to stay #p√•ske https://t.co/9zJZ5bQttp

@Elenahight @TeamUSA Definitely
It's still snowing @SolitudeMTN
And then it snowed again @SolitudeMTN
It's snowing!!!
@TatyanaMcFadden @NBCSports It's awesome!! And starting to get much better coverage from @NBCSports
You are a beast @OksanaMasters Congrats on your #Paralympics gold!! That hill climb looked gnarly.
Watching the #Paralympics this afternoon on @NBCSports
@jsichrockin @Ath4Hope @WomensSportsFdn Woot woot
That was awesome. We should do this every week #AthletesforProgress #PressforProgress @WomensSportsFdn @Ath4Hope
@bonniestjohn @WendyHilliardFD @WendyHilliardFD is the ultimate give back role model.
@Ath4Hope A8: @phaidraknight @brenda4villa @JessicaLong @sashadigiulian @bonniestjohn @MyshellParker They became successful w/out a path before them.
@Ath4Hope A7: Be your authentic self and tell your story. If you are an athlete, you have definitely had your share of experiences.
@Ath4Hope A6: Cover women's sports in the media equally, pass a girl a ball and ask her to catch, teach a sports clinic, keep kids active in schools.
@eamslider24 @Ath4Hope Great thought on women and families. So true!
@WomensSportsFdn We need more female coaches.
@Ath4Hope Q5: I think it's important to step up and take a leadership position, even if it's voluntary. If you don't maybe no one will.
@PyramidPerform Agreed.
@WomensSportsFdn I'm not intimidated by a lot of powerful men because at the end of the day I know I'm a stronger skier than them. And they know it too.
@Ath4Hope A4: We can make a HUGE difference when we work together. Especially, when are just asking to be treated equal. Who is against that?
@chasitymelvin We need more women in the decision making seats.
@bonniestjohn This still blows my mind. It's 2018.
@PyramidPerform Agreed, this number is not much of an increase.
@GirlsintheGame How can we limit this drop out? I saw the same thing in middle school.
@coachalexsachs Yup!
@Ath4Hope A3: Media coverage, funding, social biases.
A2: I can't thank the women who fought to play sports before I was born enough. W/out them every activity I love would be a fight.
@racheldawson8 Oh, hey üëãüèΩ
@Ath4Hope We're not done yet! We have to keep showing up and speaking up. #AthletesforProgress #PressforProgress
Happy #IWD2018 I'll be tweeting LIVE at 10 am MTN, join the conversation with @WomensSportsFdn @Ath4Hope
@schendrickson Exactly the person I wanted to respond to this tweet. Thank you! #bookamonthclub
@CrtvPrdx @elanmastai @charliejane Thank you!
@RickSwansonNY And they seemed so quick with their acceptance speeches.
Mondays are for powder days! So thankful I got to ski @SolitudeMTN this morning.
Another 6 inches last night. #SnowStorm And it seems to be tapering off.
Time to read a book. I need some suggestions??? #bookamonthclub
Did the #oscars just end 10 min early?
@Shay_Will The last movie I watched was Cars 3.
@Shay_Will I just didn't know when it was okay to shout out my own name. But then everyone was doing it. I do need to watch the movie though.
Yes!!! @chloekimsnow reference #oscars
Greta!!!! #oscars
So far so good. 10 inches of snow fell last night. #snowstorm
Is this real? #snowstorm https://t.co/fuSMhpgNjQ
@FergieCancade @healeysurf He's a cool guy.
Post-Olympic depression over, I just remembered the #Paralympics start in a week!!!!
@Shay_Will Love this!
@maggiesteffens Done!
Even though I critique a lot, I'm going to miss watching the #Olympics
@anna_borgman You sound tight. Start with foam rolling before and after skiing. Get a good sports massage too.
6 inches of new snow @SolitudeMTN today! More snow on its way.
@TracySingian When did @DirtyMikeDowdy lose his teeth?
@RickSwansonNY @kikkanimal @jessdiggs I wish it would never end.
@maddie_rooney35 @mikayla_oseby That was such a sick game!
@kristiyamaguchi @FareedNBCS @NBCSN Just saw you!
Tears, @kikkanimal &amp; @jessdiggs brought me to tears on that final lap of the relay. So psyched they won! Can't wait to go ski, even uphill.
@MissCoryCoffey #heardthat
Watching the full replay of the cross country team sprint #olympics
More snow in the forecast @SolitudeMTN #winterishere
@Shay_Will @united Not me.
USA wins!!!!!!!!!! üèí Gold!!!!!! #Olympics #TeamWSF What a save!!!!!
@anna_borgman This is unforgettable, so awesome
This is the exact scenario I always pretend while playing hockey by myself. #sheshootsshescores
She shoots, she scores!!!!
Please... darken the stadium like #mightyducks #USAvsCAN üèí #shootout
@LaurenStorer12 How could we go to bed?
@aimee_fuller It was so sick! I missed seeing your double though.
That shot was closer than close
@KristiLeskinen @thejessicagraf @codythemarine @jenhudak 10% rule?
@LKamperman Aren't sports fun??
@JulieFoudy But it makes for such a great movie! #mightyducks
@kristiyamaguchi So cool!
OT here they go.
2 min.
4 min. to go
That was the most intense 2 min of hockey I have ever seen.
YES!!! Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!!!!! Goal USA!!!!!
@SueHovey Elbow to the throat.
@SueHovey That was brutal
This hockey game is crazy!
What's the count for mom's winning #olympics medals? @kikkanimal @maritbjoergen @MarieMartinod @ProcterGamble needs to do a commercial
I understand no checking in hockey, but they should be allowed to toss the gloves if both players want to.
@RickSwansonNY Is it called the Olympic Hangover?
@RickSwansonNY It's a great television night.
There's so much to watch  tonight. CAN vs USA Hockey! #Olympics
@FactsOfLazz @AmazingRaceCBS @jenhudak @KristiLeskinen Got it!
I've never watched @AmazingRaceCBS before but that was awesome #TeamExtreme
Ahhh! What was the logic behind the pieces on the plane? I still don't get it. Just trial &amp; error @AmazingRaceCBS @jenhudak @KristiLeskinen
Alright back to @AmazingRaceCBS
That was sick!!! Well done snowboarding's Anna G. @JamieAsnow and Zoi @NITROSNBRDS
The two pieces of hair hanging in front of the face reminds me of when putting your ponytail in your goggles was a thing. üòè
When did every female snowboarder learn a double?? This big air is next level! #olympics
Wait! Switch back to #olympics snowboard big air!!!
Quick switch to watch the finale of @AmazingRaceCBS Go #TeamExtreme
@eamslider24 @ALTIS Way to go lady! I caught the BTS @NBCOlympics interview w/your dad today too. He's awesome, just like you.
Ha ha Nico P. is the best TV bubble boy.
WTF!!!  @Alex_Ferreira3
Halfpipe coping is no joke. I remember slamming my thigh on a hand plant (1 ft. out) and getting the gnarliest bruise.
@eamslider24 So awesome watching you race yesterday!!!
Holy @RagMow !!!! In 2nd place in the downhill #olympics
@IsabelleHanssen That's just ridiculous.
Is anyone else watching men's ski halfpipe qualifiers? There's a very broad spectrum of skill level. The Hungary skier is not alone.
@alyroe Ha ha, no it was not me. I only have enough bandwidth to watch and tweet at the same time.
@skiingrogge Ultimate rich person ski vacation?
That was awesome!!!!! @CassieSharpe @MarieMartinod @britasig you all make halfpipe skiing look so sick. #olympics
Well deserved 3rd @britasig you went big, grabbed and those moves!!
Yeah!!!! @britasig
I'm glad to see @maddiebowman is up and okay. Weird to see a helmet shell pop off like that.
@kfiocco Helmets are the only mandatory piece of armor. You can wear mouth guard, spinal protector, hip/butt guard and knee pads.
Yes!! @MarieMartinod with the dance moves on top.
@IsabelleHanssen @CassieSharpe Agreed
She did it! @CassieSharpe such a boss!
I didn't get to see her first run but I think that was better for @MarieMartinod
@jenhudak Right? She's going to be good in a few years.
You got style Zhang
I think I just saw Kim L. in the crowd at women's ski halfpipe.
Run 2 about to start
Ok ladies, who can go the biggest???
94.4 @CassieSharpe #olympics
I guess 95 for @CassieSharpe
And @MarieMartinod gets a 92!!!! So she landed! I bet she goes bigger.
Ahhh! @MarieMartinod and halfway through her run my #livestream stops #olympics
That was it @britasig top 3 for sure, maybe gold?
Wooo! @ANNA_DREW_ going huge and smooth! Get a grab on that 9 and you will medal for sure!
Maddie and Ayana go slightly down on their first runs. Looking good though.
Nice job! https://t.co/QdO7JvQCSA
@usskiteam Who shapes the pipe at the Olympics?
Sabrina with a huge first switch hit. That was sick.
Zhang who is 15 was an infant when I competed in my first US Open in halfpipe. #justsayin
Rowan with a big alley-oop. #britsontour
Smooth run for the #OAR skier Demidova
Where does everyone keep their mouth guard when it's not in their mouth? I use to put in goggle strap or pocket and I always carry back up.
@jenhudak @AmazingRaceCBS Think how much has changed since we watched this together four years ago.
@mercedesnicoll @petermansbridge Ha ha.
It's starting! @jenhudak
Ski halfpipe finals going down tonight #olympics then I'm going to be #oldlympics 'd out.
@petermansbridge @mercedesnicoll People like being outside there in the winter.
It's winter @SolitudeMTN
It's snowing @SolitudeMTN
#marchforourlives
@NickGoepper Yeah baby!
What!!! @oysteinbraten with the gold. Great show everyone, now go film some edits so we can actually watch you all ski.
Been there @OscarWester We all know you are awesome, more to come from you.
The @FISfreestyle says to @Andriragettli "Ok, let's go!!" before he drops. #rude #olympics
That was good @NickGoepper you should be sooooo stoked!
Teal's runs were sick
You're a beast @guskenworthy
I can't even comprehend how Woodsy did two triples in his run, but I'm not sure if I liked it. Because what's next three triples?
Broken right thumb but can do plenty of hand drags with the thumb. #skiersthumb @guskenworthy
Ok, it's 1 am EST again and @NBCOlympics is finally going to show the rest of men's slope. Do they not want good ratings?
Great race @MarcelHirscher Henrik, Alexis now what's going on with slope? #olympics
@canrugger @MikaelaShiffrin Oh, yeah! I'm such an old #millennial probably Twitter or Instagram
There's no way @MikaelaShiffrin has a boyfriend. She doesn't even have time to go to the movies. How did they meet and DTR?
10 racers to go.
The Alpine Race Venue looks awesome. Do you carve? #olympics https://t.co/gKOrbN35Ia
@kpetitt_stewart @NBCOlympics The worst.
@ozskier No, I got it. My internet is just slow.  Thank you though.
I can't look at anyone's tweets until I'm up to date with slope. Please, switch back @NBCOlympics
And now I'm watching GS.
Commercials and @NBCOlympics just announced they will be playing GS Live. I hope it doesn't overlap slope.
Catching an edge is the worst. #skierproblems
@AspenSpin @NickGoepper Yes!
@JulieFoudy @alyroe She's a wild one.
@IngleWitch @CBCOlympics No... üòæ
@nabbott Do your best trick last.
Baby? @NickGoepper
Why is men's ski slope not live and how come women's didn't come on until 1 am EST last night? #rude #olympics
I'm watching the @NBCOlympics prime broadcast now. It's not LIVE.
@ozskier @OscarWester @oysteinbraten @guskenworthy Hey, that's me!
Men's ski slope final about to go down. I'm picking @OscarWester @oysteinbraten or @guskenworthy will win.
@maggie_voisin You slayed it!
@anna_borgman Oh, shoot! That's not good.
@alyroe Yeah, that would've been entertaining to watch. I guess we have to wait another four years.
@brodyleven Not in America. You have to pay to watch the #olympics here and they don't even cover it that well.
@anna_borgman My stream stopped working. #olympics
It's a beautiful bluebird day @SolitudeMTN and there's a storm on the way. #perfect
@skiingrogge "Girl Power!" ‚úåüèº
@LeRiethmiller Agreed!
@trennonpaynter @IsabelleHanssen She even looks cute on a backpack.
@anna_borgman I was wondering the same thing.
@aimee_fuller @suummerhayes @TeamGB #britsontour
Way to go ladies 1. Sarah H. 2. Mathilde G. 3. Isabelle Atkins #olympics ski slope
It's just the #oldlympics they don't even put it on television in America.
Awe... so bummed for @tirilsjaastad and @johanne_killi but this contest was next level. Everyone killed it.
So proud of you for trying your dub @johanne_killi That was all time!
Atkins is such a smooth skier. Watching her, I feel like she can land anything she tries.
Going for it Gremaud!
Tiny hands @dlogan
And now she's in 1st!!!!
It just keeps getting better! Sarah H. lands her run with a dub on the bottom jump.
First spread eagle of the event, Yuki.
Great to see you back outside on snow @suummerhayes You won the dfd today.
3rd place for @maggie_voisin
Woooooooo!!! @maggie_voisin
It's looking pretty serious on the top.
I love it when the Olympians talk to us in the camera.
Shoot @tirilsjaastad went HUGE on the last run. I hope she's okay. I always hope everyone is okay.
Boo judges
I'm guessing 2nd place @johanne_killi
I can't get over how sick this contest is. Proud of the whole field.
Yes @dlogan is listening to @DMX at the #olympics "Do you think this is a game!!!!?" https://t.co/vs7iRrUgM1
Sarah H. almost landing her dub on the last jump. She has one more run too. It's getting heated!! #olympics
Anastasia from Russia has some sick grabs. I want to know her story too.
Yes!! Yuki backflip mute! #jpauclair and #jfcusson would be proud. You got the final run.
Yeah Katie-fed @suummerhayes  74 points
And then my livestream froze. #fml
Here she comes @maggie_voisin
@skiingrogge Let's do it! Next time.
Men's figure skating and men's hockey on @nbc and @NBCSports thanks for the support, not.
How is women's ski slope not on the television? #Olympics #fools
My #scandos going down on their first runs @johanne_killi @tirilsjaastad @emmadahlstrom_
Atkin sending it with the hand drag and switch 10. #britsontour
@sally_field @Adaripp Holy Cow!!!!!!! That just happened Mathilde Gremaud!!! Bio 9 and a dub 10!!! #Olympics
@sally_field @Adaripp Switch to women's ski slopestyle. Prepare to be blown away.
D-Lo is always having a dance party with herself and it shows as she skis down. She almost had that first run. @dlogan #teamWSF
I'm so glad I never needed to ski against Sarah H. She has incredible air awareness. What did she do before skiing?
Put a mute grab in on that backflip Yuki. #jpauclair #jfcusson
Women's ski slope has started on the @NBCOlympics livestream #olympics
@alyroe If only we all had a #LeeSuperFan in our lives.
@alyroe If that was her dad, that is amazing!
Coverage has concluded, Finals start at 9 pm. I can't wait!!! Ski slope women's #Olympics if the conditions stay safe, right @FISfreestyle ?
@alyroe Who was that super fan of hers in the crowd?
I love crowds.
So stoked for Lee #PeyongChang2018 and her cheer squad!!!! I can't wait to follow your ski career. 13th so @maggie_voisin moves on.
Bummer @DaraHowell ski pops off on last landing.
Ah!!! Ledeux that was an unreal run, but then going massive on the last jump. I hope you're okay.
So bummed for Kim L. she just took the last jump too slow. Rightfully so after going to the bottom on the first run.
And @tirilsjaastad gets a 89!!! 2nd place!!!
Great rails, butter dish trick and jumps for @tirilsjaastad She's in!
Sarah H. going for the switch 1080, she will get that in finals.
Ok moving onto run2
That final switch 7 from Germaud was tiggght!
Wow, this qualifier is going to be tight. So many good runs and potentially good runs.
Emma is back with a first place score.
Do you think people who ski in a slope course w/out poles always ski w/out poles?
That was awesome! Way to go Lee from South Korea. Ends her run with switch left 7.
So fun watching @DaraHowell back in a slope course. I hope she lands run 2.
Stop calling them girls livestream announcer. They are skiers, women, ladies, athletes, competitors, etc.
Can someone put something on that dfd
Katie-fed is in!!!!!
Yup!!!! @johanne_killi takes the lead 87!!!
Yes!!! @johanne_killi takes the lead in guessing.
This is a heavy qualifier. Everyone is going for hard rail tricks at the top.
@skiingrogge I like that.
Yes Jenny fra Sverige on the butter jump but then didn't have the speed for the 2nd jump.
Darian Steezin gets hung up on dfd rail.
Who's going to do a hand drag trick on the butter jump? I don't even know what to call it.
Miss Ledeux that run is üí∞
I love how all the skiers are taking different rail lines.
Nice work @maggie_voisin left rodeo 9 and rail line were on point!
Ohaco needs a pole sponsor.
Sorry I have the slowest internet.
I loved Yuki's backflip on the butter jump. That looked fun.
She looks okay after going to big and walking down. Come on Kim, 2nd run.
Kim was so solid on her gap 270 on the dfd, so bummed she went too big on the last jump.
Slight bobbles on the rails @tirilsjaastad but if she cleans that up, she'll go to the finals.
It's on! Great first run Sarah H. - very clean rails and jumps.
Why does the #olympics switch from calling it "ladies" to "women's" sometimes?
I love the #Peongchang2018 theme song.
The livestream has started on @NBCOlympics #olympics women's ski slopestyle
Gong xi fa cai! ÊÅ≠Á¶ßÁôºË≤° #HappyChineseNewYear
@TeamGB @suummerhayes Me!!!! #britsontour
@WaddellChelsea So awesome to see this type of support and I can't wait to watch a match.
@beckysauerbrunn @UtahRoyalsFC You're going to love Utah.
Tonight is the night! Women's ski slopestyle qualifiers and finals. Don't screw it up @FISfreestyle If it's windy we can wait.
Such a great freestyle sprint race @jessdiggs So fun to watch! #olympics

That was awesome!!!! Way to go @chloekimsnow Liu and @arielletgold #olympics
Bummer..... @maddie_mastro you're still the baddest. You'll have plenty of more chances.
You're amazing @thekellyclark and your riding just keeps getting better.
That was tight @arielletgold #olympics
@StevenHFisher @NBCOlympics Agreed, I hope the judges have a better angle.
@alyroe Funny how that works.
Yes!!!! @chloekimsnow I think we were all feeling the pressure on that first run. Snowboarding half pipe #olympics
@MJP951 @fissnowboard ran its Olympics slopestyle contest in a wind storm instead of postponing it.
@SheaRacing Still got it!!!!
@CrtvPrdx Is there any women on that list?
Who was in charge of the w's snowboard slope event and how do we make sure this never happens again at the #olympics ?????
@ozskier @btoddrichards I'm literally sick to my stomach.
Congratulation women's slope snowboarders you made it to the #olympics Yes, this is a one run format, we hope you clear the jumps.
Cancel this event @fissnowboard #olympics this is not fair.
@Aaron_Krafft @fissnowboard Are you watching this contest right now?
A+ men right there. https://t.co/nNEHXqPD1K
It's too windy to ski GS but not too windy to hit slopestyle jumps? This is nuts @fissnowboard #olympics
What a stud! https://t.co/GOZKtXpXiJ
@manic1hispanic Me too.
What's the temp at the slope course right now? #olympics
It's happening! Women's snowboard slope finals on @NBCSports
@olgiebear1 Me too, but she's got a long career ahead of her.
So cool to see a skier from Kazakhstan throw huge backflips, front flips and rip through the moguls. #Yulia
Catching up on the @AmazingRaceCBS Go #TeamExtreme @jenhudak @KristiLeskinen I still can't believe they are doing this and killing it!
@jhenitiuk @jonnymoseley From a vieweres perspective I think it would be more fun to watch if they grabbed or attempted to grab.
Women's snowboard slope quailes moved to tomo because of wind. #Olympics
@NastiaLiukin @Cycle4Survival That new hair girl! Looking good.
@fissnowboard Great call! Thank you for putting the safety of the riders first.
Where do you watch the #olympics ?
Women's snowboard slope quailes coming up! https://t.co/XdKDKNGoiG
@jolenevanvugt63 @channingtatum What!!! That's #magicmike you know.

Storybook ending! Well deserved @RedmondGerard you have come so far since I first met you, but we all knew you could do it. #nicepeoplewin https://t.co/uzRpYvJP0a
That's it!
Dang..... @SebToots
@reqwium @NBCSports It got better but the commercials are still coming in.
I'm not a snowboarding expert, but how did Mark beat St√•le? #Olympics #keepittight
@anna_borgman @NBCSports Maybe there's a break until the third run and they forgot to tell us?
Every 30 seconds there is a commercial @NBCSports #olympics on your live stream. What's the deal?
I can't wait to watch men's snowboard slopestyle finals #olympics
@SheaRacing Awe.... puppy. Me too.
I was given a pat-down five times this week and one in the private room by @TSA just because I opted out of the #bodyscanner Necessary?

@anna_borgman @ozskier Sorry gang, I went to dinner last night. The men's big air makes no sense to me anymore.
I can't believe I'm watching this dub 10, switch dub 10, switch 10, 9, right 7 from the ladies at @XGames ski big air
Just watched women's ski slope and snow big air!!! Holy Guacamole!!!! That was insane @XGames
It snowed 10 inches last night and now the sun is out. #FakeNews
@anna_borgman @ozskier I'm in.
@ozskier @anna_borgman Whatever you think #digi you are the expert.
I totally forgot about @mrDavidWise and I will never make that mistake again. #allfours @XGames
@anna_borgman @ozskier I want to join too.
@anna_borgman Me too.
Low score for @NoahBowmanSki @XGames
He's a soccer rocker! And he rocks at soccer! @NoahBowmanSki
Yikes @Aaron_Blunck I hope you're okay. That was an unreal run. @XGames
It looks like @NoahBowmanSki is wearing a soccer jersey. Is he?
Looking good and sounding good @jenhudak I hope @XGames replays one of your runs. #miss1080

@_Pauli @Steven_Nyman @H_Kristoffersen I just know how to cut any lift line because of learning from Austrian kids. #eurobarge
@Steven_Nyman @H_Kristoffersen That brings back so many memories of standing in lifelines with Austrian racers.
I'm so excited to watch the @XGames this week!
@skiingrogge @anna_borgman @josschristensen Who got the additional spots?
@trennonpaynter It just again proves how ignorant @realDonaldTrump is.
Such a great film about skiing lift-access lines. I want to do a trip like this @ingridbackstrom @PowderMagazine https://t.co/3XYwXIt8Za
The women ski slope skiers make it look so easy these days. Qualify at the crack of üçëthen huge rail tricks and spins each way.
@FISfreestyle @MammothMountain Qualifier at 8:25 am? That's horrible. Is that what time the qualifier starts at the Olympics too?
It's snowing! She's here @SarahBurkeFDN
Go skiing today or this weekend for @SarahBurkeFDN #celebratesarah #skiforsarah

@MyshellParker @Jackiepaaso @EvaWalkner Such bosses! Huge drops.
The #DewTour webcast died on me after snowboard slope but I am so stoked to see @johanne_killi and @HenrikHarlaut won!!!!!
Nice work ladies and that's a good looking #dewtour podium @spencerobrien @JamieAsnow @ennirukajarvi
Thank you for grabbing @britasig #dewtour
How does @britasig always get shafted by the judges? That was great skiing #dewtour
The one trick I always wish I knew how to do, the cork 9 in the pipe like @CassieSharpe #dewtour
I miss watching @AyanaOnozuka at @DewTour but she's healing up from a crash last week.
I just have to say @LukeVanValin is my favorite commentator of all time @DewTour
I have another idea @GovHerbert @OrrinHatch make UTA Public Transit free on bad #AirQuality days.
Perfection Alex F.! @DewTour side note: 3 of the 4 top men have a female coach.
Watching @DewTour while eating breakfast and holy cow @kevinrolland 1440!
Hey @GovHerbert and @OrrinHatch maybe you should incentivize Utah to buy electric cars? That would be a start to addressing our #AirQuality
@Aaron1OS @GovHerbert @OrrinHatch We were in the 156+ range this week https://t.co/b97t1qEVrd
Phew! that's a snow cloud. At first it looked like bad Utah air creeping up into the mountains. Thx @GovHerbert and @OrrinHatch #AirQuality
You are going to be so badly missed @KRobBMX Thank you for being one of those humans who inspired the world to smile. https://t.co/tPjyeqcWD8
The #AirQuality in Utah is unhealthy. What are @GovHerbert and @OrrinHatch going to do about it? #sims
There's an actual snowflake ‚ùÑÔ∏è in the forecast.
And the half pipe ladies yesterday. Well done.
Dayum! Women's snowboard #grandprix big air today was insane. It's going to be a fun year to watch it all go down.
So fun watching skiing again on @NBCSports #grandprix Sick first runs @MarieMartinod and @dlogan I'm excited to see more from Zhang too.

@CrtvPrdx that was the most basketball I have watched since this happened last year.

If @MarieMartinod does a 1080 at the bottom of a clean run she will win. #xgamesoslo or should win.
A little too much coach camera time at #xgamesoslo too @XGames #justsayin
Am I watching the same contest judges? Womens ski halfpipe #xgamesoslo
What? How did they give @MarieMartinod such a LOW score? #xgamesoslo @XGames
Does this mean women's @XGames Big Air is here to stay? I hope to see it in Aspen too! #finally

The @Samsungtweets @stalesandbech commercial is so funny how they dub his voice with an American boys voice.

@Molly_Arenberg P.S. I owe you some data. I have not forgotten.
@Molly_Arenberg Yes, talk to @angelahucles and @Hogshead3Au and if you can show them @EqualTheScore Sorry, I can't be there this year.
It's snowing again!
So, we didn't get that much snow this morning (4 inches), but it looks like it's still coming in until the end of the week. #snow
@allison__hanley pretty sure I just got you some followers.
It's a slippery slope @Shay_Will next, you will have on sweats!

@CookieBCrisp you should just watch it. If you don't cry or want to cry then you can keep your opinion. But it's sad.
