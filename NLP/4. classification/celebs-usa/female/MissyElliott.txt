🤗
Being from 90’s I have to say 70’s 80’s music allowed the 90’s to be great especially the 70’s &amp; 80’s was experimental with music so when the 90’s music came we were allowed to think out the box &amp; be creative from those eras before!🤷🏾‍♀️hey in my own opinion😉😘 https://t.co/cxb6YBOqOo
@KimergencyBee @LilKim Love this🙌🏾 my sis @LilKim❤️
