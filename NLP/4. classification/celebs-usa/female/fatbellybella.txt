Black History Month:   “I stay woke “ Came from a song called “Master Teacher” off of NEW AMERYKAH pt1 (4th world war .) 2009 AD - a very left-brain charged, social political album which was counterpart to New Amerykah Pt2 (Return of the Ankh) 2010 it’s right-brained POV.
@HAWKEYE2020i Cause u heard my album
“In 2012 #StayWoke emerged as a widely-used hashtag. Badu incited this with the first politically charged use of the phrase on Twitter; she tweeted out in support of the Russian feminist group Pussy Riot: "Truth requires no belief. / Stay woke. Watch closely. / #FreePussyRiot."
@emekadivine_ Ok just sent an invite to your box . Stay woke .🤣
@emekadivine_ So what you sayin is “WE “ gone have this conversation to dismantle the structure right here on Twitter for all to know the plan ? Ion know bout that Bruh. Maybe I ain’t the youth . Y’all talk to mf much.

Yes sis.Again.I was encouraging the group to wait for the FACTS before making a sound judgment on ANYTHING.I used my situation as an example. At the same time I received news our bro Jussie was attacked. I had already started this convo when I was alerted.The two were entangled. https://t.co/ObHvf4cYSH
@Diamondsjackson Hahahahaha
How do I get on the OTHER side of twitter? Lol

@iFredLee Lol
@RaquelWillis_ You said , is that about Jussie ? Then before you knew if it was or was not  , you gave your shit opinion. Beat it , Raquel.
This is not in ref to my brother Jussie. This is across the Board . Period . Don’t try it, fam. https://t.co/LkPM0RQeJD

Are y’all sure you know the facts before we tare shit up ? Cause just last week ..every head line written about me was all out of context and manipulated to trigger YOUR outrage.

@HennyLane Haha
Only light can cast out darknesssssss
@IilGreg Perhaps, start to discriminate between which thoughts actually evolve you and which ones are toxic and none of your business. Then exhale it away.
@connect_mc @nelsondialect Focus a goal , write it down with the belief and breath and vision that it is manefesting. And see what happens next . ..Try it and see. Think of it as “an experiment “👍🏾note : the trick is in the breathing . You must breathe as if you have accomplished it .
@connect_mc @nelsondialect The act of actually writing the thought with intent IS  the first act that triggers the next movement. The strength is in the BELIEF.
@cecepprianaz @connect_mc @nelsondialect Gucci
@DusseNot @connect_mc @nelsondialect Yes. The actual “writing” of the thought IS the first action that puts the thought into motion. It triggers ALL the movements that follow.
@connect_mc @nelsondialect Yes, but The written thought, when clearly spelled out, evokes the will for action . The degree of belief or intent put behind the written thought  is what determines the fulfilled manifestation vs the fizzling away of it.

@sweetlikez @TMZ Yes. and No matter how any of us judges the next, No ONE escapes without having to face or experience the consequences of his / her choices or actions. Where Judicial Law fails us , UNIVERSAL law is in constant effect.
@connect_mc @nelsondialect Thoughts are what CREATE the WILL or DESIRE for movement that lead to the “PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION.“ They are one in the same . Just different forms of matter.

No ma’am. I WAS NOT EVER contacted by anyone to be in documentary.@dreamhampton You know that’s not true. I wasn’t a necessary component. You had all the right people, the ones close to the situation...But for now, produce this “producer’s” request or...  APOLOGIZE. It’s simple. https://t.co/cgBcpPePMI
...y’all Make sure you Keep that same energy.
@Pam_News The video clearly is not a defense or justification of anyone’s actions . I’m not interested in qualifying the actions of others. I was sending a message of love to all involved who are HURTING. More importantly,  I  addressed the vicious cycle of abuse. The video is in my feed.
@Myrtsi1 @solomamihood @jacquemarquez_ That is correct . But the introduction was a line from a DOLEMITE - Rudy Ray Moore film from the 70’s. It was a joke written in to the script not necessarily for Kelley. The line was  “ HE HAVE DONE MORE FA THE BLAX THAN ANYONE. “ was said with and in humor. Watch it again.
That’s not true. I’ve never worked with him, don’t know him personally , and was never asked to be a part of the documentary. https://t.co/nRajs33Hjy
@jacquemarquez_ I did not do that. Why would you say that? Why would I need to justify HIS actions? I’m not qualified. I addressed sending good vibes to EVERYONE involved who is hurting AND more importantly, took a look at the cycle of sexual abuse in our lives. Where is the misunderstanding?
I love you. Unconditionally.  That doesn’t mean I support your poor choices.  I want healing for you and anyone you have hurt as a result of you being hurt. Is that strange to you ?   That’s all I’ve ever said. Anything else  has been fabricated or taken out of context. - eb

@jsmooth995 @shanegannaway @daniecal @kanyewest #1. "have done More for the blacks than anyone.." is a line from Dolomite. That's a 70s film. #2. last I checked, calling one related to u or unrelated to you brother or sister &amp; showing unconditional love doesn't make you supportive of any negative action they commit In life.
Common sense. https://t.co/G2zo2dJDaL
@jsmooth995 @shanegannaway @daniecal @kanyewest Cmon jay. Use your brain .
@jsmooth995 @shanegannaway @daniecal @kanyewest So , because I can clearly express and understand the psychological thinking of the condemned, you assume I support their alleged actions ?  Where is the reasoning?
@fgarlands @heimaeyus @Tiffs_Swagg @daniecal @kanyewest "We"  doing what now!
@heimaeyus @Tiffs_Swagg @daniecal @kanyewest I encourage my child to speak her mind. And it doesn't anger me or make me stand in opposition if our points of view differ. It doesn't mean I have to agree or disagree either. I don't support any kind of oppression.That means oppression of the mind either. Ye's thoughts are his.
Here we go
@jsmooth995 @shanegannaway @daniecal @kanyewest I didn't even know you were talkin to me . Now what ?
@___idi @yolo_tommy Thank you ?

@El_Phillippe I can get with that definition .
@GoddessCru @daniecal That's right y'all better group together . There is safety in numbers . Lol
So is "free thinking " the new thing or something . I'm seeing that term a lot . Don't put me in the shit please. I see we about to run with this term for about 5 mo weeks now.
@sho_noluv11 Ok you going to far now. Lol
@daniecal @kanyewest Ok see now u goin too far . I didn't say you were correct in your opinions about my thinking , I said , " I'll take that " because I understand The limitations on YOUR thinking. Pump your breaks. Your words are getting in your way.
@___idi @yolo_tommy We could probably build a whole new world of all the shit you don't know.
@daniecal @kanyewest Nothing you've said applies to me. But those are great points sugar puddin. ♥️
@daniecal @kanyewest To be able to clearly and objectively/ subjectively discuss a thing does not require you to agree nor disagree w/it. But it appears as if U are suggesting that when indulging in a convo involving wrong doing &amp; to UNDERSTAND the "villain" is to SUPPORT the views of the "villain"?
@daniecal @kanyewest I don't agree with that, however. Lol
@daniecal @kanyewest Ok that's fair I'll take that..even Tho my points are consistently missed. . But yeah I can see THIS YE subject was bigger than me before I commented .lol. But AGAIN.. still I say speak your mind.. even if U don't have the most popular opinion. But expect a HEAVY resistance. 👈🏾
@GoddessCru @daniecal That was dumb and incorrect .

@___idi Girl. Y'all ain't running shit . lol  U wanna know why I'm mad ?  I'm mad cause of the  over use of flower and bunny filters on your page . That outrages me .

@s1n3ng @iAmReneeWatkins @LRG_Fiend @kanyewest You'll be alright .
@LRG_Fiend @iAmReneeWatkins @s1n3ng @kanyewest No baby, Not a matter of a individuals being "wrong"or"right".Perhaps a matter of accepting (&amp; I'm going to stretch &amp;even say 'respecting') the thoughts of others when they are "different " from YOURS or those of the "group's".Something is "wrong" with that. DIALOGUE vs DEMONIZE
@kanyewest .. see. that's what u get for using your own brain...u know that's illegal in most states right?

@_mayafique I'm not . Just clarifying .
@david_marchese Thank you .❤️
Voicing honest opinions (even if they are meant to be loving) in such a sensitive world where most of us are victims of some violent past is very dangerous. Even encouraging words can be misinterpreted when taken out of context. Human beings are very delicate. Protect one another
@Love_WAShere I'm not. Clarification is important amongst a society who believes before they read tho. ❤️
And I still love you.
@Woldcnews Still love them tho
@tymekz187 I've been there brother .
Either U read the entire VULTURE interview &amp; U understood the message of compassion CLEARLY.   OR U only read the selective, out of context Headlines, &amp; were drawn in2 the whirlpool of collective emotional grief. I don't want 2 force U 2understand the way I love. I'm hopeful tho.
People are in real pain. So I understand why my 'good' intent was misconstrued as 'bad'. In trying to express a point, I used 1 of the worst examples possible, Not to support the cruel actions of an unwell, psychopathic Adolf Hitler, but to only exaggerate a show of compassion.

I bet. That made abit uncomfortable for me too but after I realized it was a current issue I was able to internalize https://t.co/dLocBoUmXS
I get it  https://t.co/0fdlYRijPp
Interesting . Then it was a successful  debate if it created more dialogue. How'd it go?  https://t.co/boK96K3jcL
It's natural. People were just emotional. Women go thru a lot to just be human around here.  https://t.co/4sVIEjwv9r
not at all. As a mother my concern is that yng women are properly educated about primal nature and choosing wisely.  https://t.co/sXT9kzFLZl
Agreed. But because we cant properly monitor or adjust what the world "should be" it is WISE 2b aware &amp; proactive.  https://t.co/SIGEW1dmfF
Well that was part of the reason. But not the sole reason. And not because males shouldn't be responsible adults.  https://t.co/j4SYGNYEy1
Not necessarily.That's where individual circumstance comes n2play. It's a touchy issue since women are shamed daily. https://t.co/wyURmrwuZM
@TristonSpencer but u have the capability to choose how you steer your primal urges. You would have to be deviant to prey on under age boys.
@TristonSpencer o okay I'm I see. But that's a great point u brought up. Your primal attraction to men has lil 2 do with morality.Understand
Perhaps, but that is not the issue.  The conversation was on what I deemed acceptable in a HS learning environment.  https://t.co/6sd8IkruCd
That is also correct. Men and Women2 ,  must be held responsible for their actions regarding primal attractions  https://t.co/M0MeoOtZjn
Huh?  https://t.co/6hSl0lscJG
That is correct .no one is excused for deviant behavior no matter what the nature. .  https://t.co/oqBSr3TVbk
@TristonSpencer @__getithowulive these things were taught in 5th grade. However, again, any antidote I have is meant to nurture ,not shame.
@TristonSpencer @__getithowulive the word primal means basic or natural. So we are all primal in nature...can't b erased by moral belief.
@__getithowulive hmm. Clearly my best interest is in that of young girls.Thats evident.  But ones Nature isn't the crime ones DEVIANCE is.
@__getithowulive but what I was articulating was the nature of primal attraction 2developing https://t.co/MLb8XKeLRG Morality &amp;biology clash

Sorry u feel that way. But we could dialogue intelligently had you not admitted you DID NOT read all my tweets .  https://t.co/NngKN3P8eC

I think that would be best.  https://t.co/VKNhby8IHR
Yes &amp; I agreed with some parts of article and explained clearly where I did not,injecting responsibility in attire. https://t.co/Nm2SeCfxlw
I do.  https://t.co/FkK43GbBeY
Agreed. You must've read my tweets. But irregardless of who is attracted there is age appropriate attire IMO https://t.co/M9kBl4lIp8

Let's  CONSIDER that all men are not predators. Let's CONSIDER that dressing age appropriately is not shameful.  https://t.co/lJtBLtDAHh
Correct : " Shouldn't have to "  https://t.co/bhvztP8nvV
They a dressed appropriately for dance. People at beach dress for beach. People in classroom setting dress for class https://t.co/uG01IIvQUT

If there was NO crime in the world at ALL I would have a say in what my maturing daughters where in certain settings https://t.co/Io1RmNaFW5
Key word here is "victim". All HS age girls arent victims but some of their school attire needs policing by elders. https://t.co/3GpRLk3hMV
So what if said scrutinizing a young girls clothing Is coming from her parent . Is that rape culture?  https://t.co/3GpRLk3hMV
Fair enough. &amp; if u believe  hs hem line lowering only equates 2 victim shaming etc then it's natural we won't agree https://t.co/kddXZ1vfiQ

Ha!  https://t.co/vaXNFb7UEZ
Tho my tweets were taken out of context in my 360 view of sexuality, men's nature &amp; responsibility &amp;modesty I am glad this dialogue sparked.
..because I've always been a thinker, I often wondered y they'd not explaind hormones &amp;natural sexual attraction So I vowed 2do so as a mom.
...What these wiser older women knew had little to do with how / what boys thought.  They were -in their own way- guiding us thru puberty.
...Problem is, we weren't given proper explanation 4this so we thought we were bein "hated on " by female teachers.But they knew something.
...It was mostly the Female teachers who enforced skirt length and other appropriate attire. We had matured faster and were more dominant.
..I Went 2Catholic school where knee length uniform applied.but my friends &amp; I would find ways 2look "sexy" Poor Boys didn't have a chance.
...when these feelings started to flower, I didn't think to discipline myself because all I knew was to be myself.Luckily the coach ignored.
..I didn't know anything about estrogen &amp;testosterone or that those things in biology we learned applied to me. But The coach was "fine" .
In 8th grade I was attracted to my bball coach when 1 year before, I had no such thoughts. But My body was changing. My skirt got higher...
Thank you.  https://t.co/9A9LFapCHM
I agreed with parts of the article below, but my examination of male sex attraction didn't sit well.Was Mistook 4excusing deviant behavior.

Which parts of this do you agree with and which parts do you oppose?   https://t.co/QLVXVkqCEf

If we believe that choosing to cover the body is designed to protect us from male consumption then we will naturally fight against it.
Patriarchy has demeaned women so much that it has warped the sensibilities.We are defending ourselves against our own children's sacredness

Again, my no-reading friend,  We aren't at war w/ boy's nor men's urges. We want 2 re define what POWER looks like.  https://t.co/TSlgxZrvR0
I prefer a longer uniform skirt in a LEARNING environment not only 2 create a professional setting but to re implement the beauty in virtue.
Yes.I prefer a longer skirt as apposed to a shorter one on hs uniform. But not to take the responsibility from men who they attract.
As RESPONSIBLE mothers AND FATHERS ,we EMPOWER our young women, but also guide them in making informed decisions on HOW 2will their POWER.
Nobody HAS to do anything.  https://t.co/dXrG8KAYJ4

It's not SHAMEFUL 4 a girl 2b empowered &amp;modest &amp;aware at once.Being AWARE of sexual behavior doesn't make her responsible for deviants.

Google: biological predisposition.   (&amp;This is becoming Redundant but ) Which by the way is no excuse for deviant behavior.
It's not that they wouldn't choose to but males have a natural genetic IMPULSE which btw doesn't excuse deviancy.  https://t.co/dmgwF01Ayh

We can have this Convo as long as the FAM desires. At least we are dialoguing about it. It's an important conversation.
An older healthy non deviant male's  attraction to flowering young women is as natural as a developing young girls attraction to older men.
Again Healthy NON-DEVIENT Male adults &amp; youth in a HS. environment should take responsibility 4 the control of their natural sexual urges..
Now when we are talkin bout the hschool environment,even RESPONSIBLE non deviant males are aroused.Lowering skirts IS HELPFUL not Shameful.
In a perfect world . Yes  https://t.co/ANFHF5RkH5
How do you know  https://t.co/ThAdUTw82U
Even in some African and other tribal nations the elder women tie ribbons on the adolescent women to distinguish them from the adult women.
Perhaps.Thats IF we do not educate them in the subject of sexual chemistry. This eradicates the illusion of shame .  https://t.co/z9BK5y2UIf

Why do you Think men are so aggressive toward the suppression of women?
I see you sis.  https://t.co/fQPfJabVzm
Women r under the illusion that they r not in control. So they emulate the "oppressor" while accepting the role of victim. It's conflicting.

Who is we? https://t.co/NOaL0JGl57
Incorrect. I didn't have an opinion on wether it was OK. That's not how I use my platform. I stated that it occurs.  https://t.co/DSsYTDBaja
That is incorrect. I just told U what I implied.Furthering this point only helps YOUR argument which doesn't apply.  https://t.co/QFgH2RhJ8A

Nor do I,sis. But being responsible doesn't require a proceeded act of IRResponsibility just a HEIGHTENED AWARENESS. https://t.co/jrocNcXoLv
Well sis,  I just refrain from calling out the "educated dummy's" and try to treat everybody with a lil respeCK.  https://t.co/RWo0Z0otnE
So do you not think Young women are capable of being responsible in society without feeling like they are at fault?  https://t.co/sgDTXuIDhk
C, the ONLY problem w/the "slut shame" or "victim blame" POV, as far as my tweets R concerned,is that it just DOESN'T apply.but good points.
If you a dumb mufukah..... Let  the  Internet  resssst. 💤
Think about this a lil more.  https://t.co/zMampv2oN2
No. I disagree. I strongly believe that in this sex driven society, hs age girls can be mistaken for women too soon. https://t.co/zMampv2oN2
Right.  https://t.co/UbMpWMpGZ2
Right. But young ladies should be guided and protected . Dig?  https://t.co/Tj7peOELIQ

@TheRoot of bullshit.  Still using lazy dehydrated journalism to insult the intelligence of the underestimated masses.  Unfollow us.
...Realizing this excludes the "villain" .  The real enemy is ignorance.
W/ that said, the "fighting 4 female sexual equality" vs repairing myths in the nature of human sexuality clash violently in this argument.
Let's observe that LAW has attempted to dictate NATURE.. Think.There would be no need for MORAL LAW if we were NATURALLY MORAL in action.
Ha.  https://t.co/lqaMtfZEsN
Naw. I appreciate us not agreeing. We all grow at our own rates. It ain't a race .  https://t.co/kpUHC1S8JR
We are currently discussing an article about hschool age women in control environment lowering the hem line of their skirts ...Join in.
Incorrect again. WE are rationally discussing an article we read. What r u doing is the question. Unfollow us.  https://t.co/pFheK9P7ab
Agreed. That is a part of it .  https://t.co/Bqd4SWRafN
Damn I wish I had some shit to sell right now .   Random.
Agreed. But they are.  https://t.co/IpxgfoPI12
It's the perfect place .  https://t.co/ilZJtTaUOu
@plantmanvegan1 @albyselkie lol
Incorrect. An inclination to be attracted to women of child bearing age is natural. PEDOPHILIA is deviant behavior.  https://t.co/nDBXBHiloU
You mean " young women" in  a controlled hschool environment &amp;their uniform skirt?Because I'm a woke human being. https://t.co/i0Qlxy1QQM
The problem is the lack of true understanding we have for sexuality &amp; human behavior.  Creates a false battle.  https://t.co/kOTcz9R0tD
In moral court.But these "creeps" &amp; "victims" alike must be realistic when dealing with the human thought process.  https://t.co/jDSPNGZOTH
Victim Blaming?Our daughters certainly aren't Victims.They are sober minded young women taking active part in change https://t.co/yAF0UOKMPT
Yes. It IS weird. We are taught to believe that there is an age restriction on attraction. That is Law not nature.  https://t.co/7dnOmnd9vW
The issue is not "why"we have sex. It is"that" we have sex. CHILD BEARING age women  naturally attract healthy males https://t.co/lZ0Smc7YVv
Yes.But Again,WE are talking about teen women and men in a controlled school environment lowering their uniform hem. https://t.co/CE4Lcw3Kmj
Morning.  We are here . This is now. Do your best.
Hahaha. I agree. But that's not reality beloved. What is REAL is that we are here and this is now. morality vs bio.  https://t.co/tSuvgHOQaR
@Silus60 that's what the article was about. High school age girls.
@iamcarljones I really like your mind .
Yes I did  https://t.co/yYAsvGBouk
Thank you fam for your comments and concerns about our youth in a sexually driven society. Continuing the dialogue. BUILD.
We are addressing it all sugar  https://t.co/2Fq7xVnhTG
...basically.
Peace. To catch you up on the subject at hand. A high school is ruling that it's female students lower the hem lines so as not to distract..
They aren't required to. https://t.co/OrC0SlVHkw
Yep.  https://t.co/nsujxT0XZ6
Hahahaha  https://t.co/Foxo8ij1z8
Are we in the same discussion?  https://t.co/GNbRYs3OfP
Incorrect. We are not talking about actions. We are talking about nature.  https://t.co/TgN1oK9asZ
I believe in starting where we are and building from there.  https://t.co/idaBFATicV
Fax.Especially when those values no longer evolve us.But we can build 100 new worlds on strong-principled foundation https://t.co/iE7DEyOLWF
Agreed. It's weird because we don't have the conversation.  https://t.co/Hd51kjojyN

Then it wouldn't be fun.  Thats too easy shawty.  https://t.co/xdytmY8xt1
Center it then .  https://t.co/X0fzhwbo19
I believe I was fair in seeing both sides. Again. We are ALL responsible.  This is where we are. https://t.co/ieUuBPdjUe
I'm counting on it.  https://t.co/BVEZeNPj2X
I agree.  https://t.co/tvQlQmU6rG
Morality is set up to protect our young but when it fails &amp; nature over rides we must step in and use intelligence.  https://t.co/ih4AA3bKX0
Being attracted to a young woman in a short skirt does not make one a "pervert" It makes them human.  https://t.co/ih4AA3bKX0
I feel u. Why is it dangerous?  https://t.co/apTtNdRj37

That's a lil harsh. https://t.co/cyn3sVMNJR
Whatever best serves us all.  We are all responsible.  https://t.co/lBqds4VT26
"Punished" is a perspective.   https://t.co/hlx1eFxl6T
You mean it's not " moral" .  https://t.co/biBx5iETNl
I don't have to conform to that . I actually think it's a good idea to make the uniforms longer.  https://t.co/qJRedcqE0g
What did U read?  https://t.co/vQ4DoBW7Ce
I addressed that as well. Scroll back, beloved  https://t.co/PsRGg6pApZ
No. I'm going to look at it from all angles where I can.  https://t.co/7xnMqMJ3hH
What do u think @iamcarljones ? We need a male perspective.
I think that about I covered everything.
I said ALL of that . Read it again  https://t.co/yW1uwaD408
No . It implies that we are intelligent enough to adjust as we evolve.  https://t.co/9MtoNbZrgD
They can absolutely control themselves. I believe it difficult in such a sex driven society but that is no excuse. https://t.co/COtJo65WIo
...young women you are beautiful. Young men you are beautiful. Protect one another.
...if I had a school I would make sure that the uniform skirt length was a nice knee length... It is fair to everyone...
..Consequently, we must all be aware and responsible.  We must protect our young women. We must teach our young men...
...But do I think it is unnatural for a heterosexual male 2b attracted to a young woman in a revealing skirt? No. I think it is his nature..
Males should be taught to be responsible for their actions from childhood. It's not ok to "prey" on young women...
...I want my daughters to understand this. I want them to be themselves and wear what they like, yet be aware. Not ignore our differences...
... aware and awake. Men and women both go thru cycles of arousal. Men automatically are attracted to women of child bearing age....
...it is not them who is doing anything wrong by being beautiful and attractive but with such imbalance in our society it is smart to be...
...one way to protect youth is to remind them we are all sexual in nature and as they grow  and develop it is natural to attract men...
...I am aware that we live in a sex l-driven society. It is everyone's, male and female's, responsibility to protect young ladies...
There was an article ruling that high school girls lower their skirts so male teachers are not distracted. I agreed because...
I'll listen to it tho sis  https://t.co/9HAkAdex8a

Very few meet a fellow human and look in his eyes for what service we can provide to lighten his/her load (well maybe hookers) but u get it
People are attracted 2 People for the benefits they provide.. For the potentiality of some sort of gain.Even if it's 2 mimic or learn from
Most Men don't see us as human beings, potential friendships. We are sized up for consumption of some sort, then discarded if we don't fit.
