@kjothesmartass Tis true than whenst I see a wee lady, I stare at her in fascination, wondering just how she got so tiny. Then, as I cautiously approach the sprite, I realize that in most cases I am still, smaller than she.

Holding onto hope.
My theme song for the moment. http://youtu.be/2x4L9s2KOOM

I luv 2 snack on that Cracklin Oat Bran cereal & also Quaker Oatmeal Squares... But milk on the side is a must. :)
Hi! What is everybody's fav cereal?
@mzcat59 who is there?
Remember on PeeWee's Playhouse how they'd have a 'word of the day' and everyone would go crazy when they said it?  Today's word: ORANGE!
@houserhythm oops!  Ok. I'm still learning-thank you.
I'm putting this #FF out early & also bc I don't know how to use #FF, but my first ever #FF goes out @rotca1
@mzcat59 who's there?
If u can't tell by the awesome jokes, I'm procrastinating going to my cardio kickbox class... doo duh doo deee dumm... Ok, I'm going.
What did the sushi say to the bumble bee?  Waaaasaaaabi?!
ORANGE you glad tomorrow is Friday.  OKAY! I'll stop. Sorry.
Thanks for getting me thru this guys. From now on, I'm gonna EAT that odd, irregular shaped bit of an orange, I will. And I'm gonna LIKE it.
hmmm. Different. A bit on the tough side, a bit tart, not as juicy as I'd have liked, but sturdy no doubt, with a strange shape in my mouth
I'm goin for it!  I'm goin for it!
Ya know that weird top part of the inside of an orange that has a strange shape, not like a slice... Am I supposed to eat that?
@sdp09 thanks!!
@iHumble I was there at the same time as Ryan Howard. :)
@JuJuHoffman it takes some getting used to, but I think you'll like twitter :)
@iHumble I went to Lafayette HS in St. Louis, Missouri. I loved school! When running 4 StuCo president, my sign read "More bounce per ounce"
Now, I've never met the man, true... but I'm fairly sure Mr. Harry Connick Jr. was singing to me tonight on Idol.
Betty White makes me smile.
Have a terrific Tuesday!
