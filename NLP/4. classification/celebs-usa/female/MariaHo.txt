@WPT_TJ_Shepherd @howiemandel Aww thank you! That was so much fun to be a part of!
Highlight of the #USPO:  Working with such an exceptional group of people both in front of the camera and behind the scenes.  Lowlight of the USPO:  Losing the @FranksRedHot challenge to @Bhanks11. 🔥  Thanks for letting me be a part of it and thanks to all those that tuned in! https://t.co/AaDemj8PJi
@ratedGTO @Kevmath @WSOP @RLVPoker Thanks!!!
@iAmeriCaRR @briankoppelman Wait, what? I’m agreeing with Brian! Pizza is my go to food!

@DrJudyHo @FaceTheTruthTV 😍😍😍
Old enough to shush people in the movie theatre but not too old to watch Frozen for the fifth time...this year.
@kooraay90 @PlayPokerLkAMan ❤️❤️❤️
@KatieStonePoker @PlayPokerLkAMan Thanks Katie! Appreciate the love especially from a lady boss such as yourself. So happy that Lauren won, she’s so easy to root for and her love and dedication to the game is inspiring!
@GregMerson @PokerGO @PokerCentral Aww yay! Glad you’re tuning in Greg!
@ZENofLEN Hahah oh no, it’s what I ate AFTER that salad! 🥪🍔🍟🌮🍕🍣🍪
@BennieWehmeyer @zyngapoker @EmperorsPalace Poker &gt;
@Ahujababydaddy I would play early Saturday then. Will be biggest field and likely softest imo and you don’t want to play the late session because that way you’ll be fully rested when you make day 2!
@WillMcGinnis4 @DrJudyHo @FaceTheTruthTV @MsVivicaFox @MsRosieMercado Best of luck to you!
@FelipeMojave @Bhanks11 @jeffplatt @PokerCentral ❤️
@Marxmon186 @DrJudyHo @FaceTheTruthTV Thank you so much Mario!
@BrianArd7 Thanks Brian!
@MattLubawski Thanks for that, Matt! I still do commentary for other tourneys on the circuit so please tune in! 🙂
@GeekyLion99 Hi there! I believe so! I’ll check in with her again
@SampsonSimmons 🤣
Me: I overate so much that I woke up in the middle of the night wanting to throw up.  Also me: What’s for breakfast tomorrow? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Thanks for having me on! I hope that Will found our advice to be beneficial! https://t.co/b7PJF1XAgK
@FaceTheTruthTV @DrJudyHo @MariaHochips Actually @mariaho is my Twitter handle! 🙂
@WillMcGinnis4 @DrJudyHo @FaceTheTruthTV @MsVivicaFox @MsRosieMercado Hi Will! Thank you so much for sharing your story with us and for letting us give you some (hopefully) useful advice moving forward! Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors!
I’ll be a guest on #FaceTheTruth TODAY to offer some advice to a recreational #poker player that needs help knowing when to get up from the tables. Had a great time being part of the esteemed panel especially alongside my sister, @DrJudyHo!  📺: https://t.co/UCcJVhAs32 https://t.co/wtHAPHkMrB
#LOVE is a whole mood rn. #HappyValentinesDay https://t.co/HxDUsLdtfs
@Ahujababydaddy Depends on if you’re planning on re-entering? If so then first flight to give yourself most chances possible.
@JohnnyAsays @PokerGO @jeffplatt @Bhanks11 Awesome!! There will be great content for you to learn from!
What a memorable experience to be a part of the show my sister @DrJudyHo is on! Thank you @FaceTheTruthTV for having me and helping an aspiring poker player #FaceTheTruth! You can watch the episode this Friday, Feb. 15th. Love these ladies they are 🔥  📺: https://t.co/UCcJVhAs32 https://t.co/AVV7IWOUzr
@Delta get your shit together guys, you have a plane malfunction out of a place like Daytona Beach that has hardly no other options departure wise which just absolutely kills my whole day when I had a 6am flight booked originally precisely because I had a whole day of work ahead
@BobMatherPoker Boss moves
@jeffplatt Hahah I can’t wait to listen to this
@SampsonSimmons @Postmates It me. Good thing you didn’t encounter any of their inexplicable cancellations after waiting over an hour for your food already otherwise that would have hurt your ability to unlock this achievement.
When you’re jet lagged you spend a good thirty minutes drooling over @Raising_Canes IG page at 4:00am and check to see when the nearest location opens in the morning. T-5 hours, I might not even sleep until then! #notanad
@JCHAPABA I’m pretty basic. Pepperoni is always good
@pizzaiola_boss 😋😋😋
@WileDavid All pizza! Prefer thin though
@KevinDarbyLA 😋😋😋
@JonathanLittle Couldn’t agree with this more!!! Especially in an environment like the one we’re in that at times breed some negative and toxic behaviors. Happy to keep my circle small and filled with happy, positive and uplifting people!
Chin-chin it’s #NationalPizzaDay! https://t.co/oprnuEXPQz
@SMcK723 Hahaha good one!!!
Also for those interested, here is said beanie. I mean, who can pass up that deal?! Great quality imo https://t.co/mgUmQ8blxs
@Stapes You didn’t ask if I was morning buying! Drinking will commence in T-3 hours. Will keep you posted if you’re interested.
Didn’t think buying 2 bottles of champagne at 11am(comes with a free beanie!🤔)would cause concern from the guy buying three 40s, two magnums of vodka and twenty scratch-off tickets. But yes sir, this isn’t all for me, and no, I’m not driving. Also, heck of a party you’re having!
@Joesilly88 I promise it really does!
@kittykuopoker @810ofclubs ❤️❤️❤️
My belly is full from copious amounts of food and my heart’s full from a night of deep belly laughs with a group of incredibly inspiring people. Now I’m in bed by 10pm while my other friends are still out and about and there’s not a single ounce of #FOMO in my body. ❤️ #thisis30s
@Farah_Galfond @PhilGalfond @RunItOncePoker Yes, I’ll be there! Let’s do dinner before a sesh? 😘
@Farah_Galfond @PhilGalfond @RunItOncePoker Thanks for sharing, Farah! Congrats to you and Phil on the launch and for a finding a true partner in life in one another!
@PhilGalfond @RunItOncePoker Huge congrats, Phil! Your dedication and commitment will surely be rewarded!
@Stapes Better have my reserve marked down!

@jeffplatt Co-sign!
@Randi_heatlifer @FadedSpadeCards @dakotaxx @RunGoodGear @CardsChat @PokerGO @PokerCentral @RealKidPoker @phil_hellmuth The poker community thanks you guys for reminding us just how lucky we are to do this for a living and for bringing out the fan of the game in all of us. It’s so important that as pros we don’t lose sight of what drew us to the game in the first place before making $ was a factor
@aseefo @Stapes @J_Hartigan @RaSZi @PokerStars Thank you so much! We’re glad you enjoyed the coverage. And yes, I have a soft spot for Stapes it probably shows in the commentary!
@PokerNightSoc @cardplayerlife @FadedSpadeCards @andrewneeme Thank you so much for the kind words, Patrick!
Feel like this is a safe space now to admit that this also applies to hotel rooms before I let housekeeping in. i.e. dirty towels must be in a nice neat pile on the floor, all trash in bins, room service piled up on tray, sheets straightened, no clothes on floor etc.
@KJBorgen1 @zyngapoker is an awesome free to play site. Tons of users!
Sing it if you know it! https://t.co/CCIZlnstns
@agmdv Glenn!!! Hi! So lovely to play with you and hear your story. Your excitement and love for the game is contagious! Thanks for looking after me with the waters as well!!!
@conniemorton @cardplayerlife @andrewneeme Thank you Connie! I really appreciate that.
@SJKenners @cardplayerlife @andrewneeme Thanks Steve! I definitely try to put things into perspective at the end of the day and having a good outlook goes a long way in this game.
@Simkha Just happened upon this thread. Thank you for sharing, it’s clear you put a lot of thought into it and have your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in our community.
@happenin_hinesy @AussieMillions @kittykuopoker Tyty!
@2braceletmom @UncleRonAA You keep them in line Lynn! :)
@Jeff_Charlton Yes!
@Amo4sho Support group incoming!
@JasonKoon We should start a support group. 😂
@RhynoHelton 😂
@Farah_Galfond Haha! Oh, us.
@Marxmon186 😂😂😂 this is hilarious
@MikeGatenby Yes but probably not as thoroughly! Haha
The cleaning before the cleaners get here is so out of control that I’m considering cancelling the cleaners because I’ve done such a thorough job pre-cleaning.
@JamieKerstetter 😂😂😂
@drew_amato @PokerCentral Drew...Drew Amato? Congrats!!! 🎉🎉🎉
@sgoad73 @CharlieCarrel Thanks for that, Scott! That means a lot to me.

@TheBradMorrison Thanks for the support, Brad!
@AlfredX_ Thank you!
@rocketfolds @Joeingram1 Congrats!!!
@Spencaz Yesssssss always for the ho’mies.
@zoemcharters I think jet lag wise you should come 3-4 days beforehand. Those are long days of play and you want to feel as fresh as possible! All of the $1500 and belows especially ones with big gtd’s, multiple flights, etc are the best value!
Oh hi there! https://t.co/WtvgyEFHBM
@700JPM700 @franciiiiine 🍕🍕🍕
@HeshYH88 @J_Hartigan @Stapes Hello, mah grand-babies

@WileDavid I’m all caught up!
@NetWizardPoker @AussieMillions @AngusMonfries! Are you going to swing by? Play a little poker with us? I’ll let you know if I end up there.
@Ironman0509 @NetWizardPoker Much love to you and your wife, Steve!
@WileDavid Actually can I change mine to her, too? She’s badass!
@NetWizardPoker @AussieMillions Definitely!
@Rhale5461 😂
@WileDavid Jon Snow
@Ashly_Zwolinski @WPT Thanks Ashley! I had a great time and Shireen was amazing!
@JonathanTRowe I think meditation has helped me tremendously on becoming less emotionally attached to the results
@NetWizardPoker @AussieMillions I might! Not 100% sure yet, but I love Oz!
I can tell you the names of all the direwolves and which Stark they are paired with on #GameOfThrones but after six days straight I still turn right out of my hotel room when it’s a left to the elevator. 🤦🏻‍♀️
@joeglenn2 I use a hud when I play online usually but not always
@BajaRun323 @PokerStars @Stapes @phil_hellmuth Thanks for the support!
@DjKurt6566 I would have taken the deal as well.
@ScottBonzDMI @Stapes @J_Hartigan Haha love this!

@NYSportsGuy210 This is good to reflect on! Thanks!!
@DimaggioDerek Thanks!!!!
@uptheirons_666 @Stapes Hahahaha with pleasure!
@joeglenn2 @RealKidPoker Hey! That seemed like an insane fold, not sure if i could do it myself, but the reasoning behind it seems sound and there are always external factors such as live reads that always go into the best of folds, imo. Sick one by her!
@comicrican It hasn’t been as easy as I thought it would, keep ya posted!
@Riz1803 Yep! For about 10 hours. :/
@mr_nit Thank you Carlos! Hope you tune in again today!
@HeshYH88 @J_Hartigan Haha i can kind of see that now that you mention it.
@TheBradMorrison Hahah love it
@uptheirons_666 @J_Hartigan Thanks Peter! I live to harmonize!
@elron6900 @J_Hartigan @Stapes I miss it, too! I want to try to do it in Joe’s stead but not sure if it’ll be as enjoyable!
Get there!!! 👇👇👇 https://t.co/i9irantTH4
Good reminder for myself today as it applies to #poker. Made a bad call last night against an unknown player and ended up stone bubbling a $5k tourney. Went to bed beating myself up over it and woke up with it hanging over my head. Gonna lean into learning from it. #thankyounext
@Colin64032558 *comms
@joeglenn2 I will very likely be back!
@BobBrady2 Thank you!!!!
@balooko31 @Stapes @J_Hartigan Kinda, sorta, not really? Lol

@ElleSriracha Aww thank you! You did awesome today and were super well composed and had a great table presence! Wishing you lots of luck!!!
@Stapes @RealKidPoker That’s why they pay him the big bucks.
@SampsonSimmons @jeffplatt Video poker?!
@Kevmath Noooooooooooooooo
@SampsonSimmons 😂
@katelinds @Firaldo87poker I was worried when I saw him in line at the bar and now my fear has been confirmed...
@DarrenElias @tonyhawk @PokerStars At least he didn’t call you with 7 high and was good...or has he?! I got owned by him in a hu match!
@Randi_heatlifer @RealKidPoker @PokerStars @JHilsercop So nice to meet you two! See you guys around all week!
@JenShahade @howiemandel @DealNoDealCNBC @CNBC Hahah they’re pretty good at editing a cliffhanger promo!

@kimwaltrip aw shoot I’m not able to tag you in photos! So lovely to see you yesterday!
Spent a laughter-filled evening at the @PSFilmFest gala with this awesome squad in celebration of the producers and actors of @WalkToVegasFilm. I can’t wait to watch it on the silver screen! #PSIFF19 https://t.co/Pw6KWEERAR
Beautiful women in ball gowns and diamonds coming down from their hotel room with a red solo cup in their hand on their way to the @PSFilmFest gala is #goals. #PSIFF19
@LeslieHess68 Debate no more! Usually once every 2-2.5 weeks! ;) haha. 💅
@ctyewalker Um first order of Twitter business in 2019 is follow you.
@azurebluesy You too lovely!
@PhilGalfond Congrats you guys!!! ❤️❤️❤️ @Farah_Galfond
People look at the new year as a way to wipe the slate clean, usually on the things that surround us or involve others, but, it’s important to forgive yourself, too. Have an inner voice that is kind not only to others, but yourself as well. Too often we are hardest on ourselves.
@Shillibier @WIPHOF Thanks Will! I had a great time chatting with you for this article and thanks for being such an active part of the community! HNY!
Also who am I kidding, I ALWAYS play QT suited.
I don’t always play QT suited, but when I do I do it with tinsel on my head. Happy holidays from the #FridayNightPoker Season Finale! #nogamblenofuture https://t.co/C7VIK0KFmA
@TottenhamKid Terranea! Love Pelican though

👇👇👇 https://t.co/nLyZiv9ZgN
Maybe I need to clarify, I was 6th out of the 6 teams that make it into the playoffs meaning I made it by the skin of my teeth. 10 team league. K thanks, bye.
@BobMatherPoker Haha i meant guys colloquially, Bob.
@NYSportsGuy210 Meaning going into playoffs I was ranked 6 out of the 6 teams that made it. Lol 10 team league
Realizing just how similar my first time playing #fantasyfootball is to #poker after being 6/6 in my league, squeaking into playoffs then somehow making it to the finals and before I’ve even won already thinking about how high I can up the stakes next season. Guys, am I a degen?
@VanessaSelbst @PokerGO I’m dead. Cuteness overload
@JonathanTRowe @PokerGO We will answer your question at the break desk coming up!
@KeZebra7933 @PokerGO @Ali_Nejad @NickSchulman @Bhanks11 @jeffplatt @PokerCentral @ARIAPoker Thank you Kevin!
@GeekyLion99 Yep I sure did! Thanks!
Feeling insanely grateful for the opportunity to work on such an extraordinary broadcast as the #SHRBV with such a remarkable crew of people. It brings out the die-hard poker fan in me to see how far #poker has truly come. Many thanks!!! https://t.co/3FHorZ62eN

@RealKidPoker Classic DNegs ❤️ at his best
@chaoops123 They have a total of 300,000 chips they can take in 100,000 increments. They can choose to take it all at once for a full stack of 300,000 or wait until they bust one stack of 100,000 for the next one. After level 9 all “bullets” must be in play.
@Sam_Wilson3737 @PokerGO @WAFoxen @KrukPoker @junglemandan Thanks for the support!
@BwandonAlb @PokerGO Thanks for the kind words!
And In case you actually did miss this...https://t.co/h1ID8Hjt5K

@GeekyLion99 Haha. Will send an autographed photo! Address?
After playing #poker all this time I still get got by that feeling of unadulterated hope which is immediately followed by utter disappointment from seeing an Ace as my first card then a rag as my second card. Never change, poker.
@PokerCentral @Cal42688 @WPT @BellagioPoker @PokerGO Let’s go Cal!!!

@tankfreepoker @PokerCentral @PokerGO I didn’t take offense to it and I definitely don’t think he meant anything by it, that being said I think my “I don’t see any little girls here” retort served to cover all bases. 😉

I did the qualifier dirty yesterday to take the chip lead 3 handed on #PokerAfterDark, but that accidental needle from Eli Elezra at the end was the salt in the wound. 🧂🧂🧂#waitforit https://t.co/Fo2E86UB3R
@weintraub_seth @PokerGO @PokerCentral Yay!! Hope you collected that money!
@tjurk44 @PokerGO I felt it! :/

Hey Florida poker pals! I hope you’re voting on Election Day (Nov 6th) for obvious reasons and when you do, please #VOTE NO on Amendment 3. The good peeps @ppapoker have all the details on why it’s bad for the #poker community. https://t.co/mpxoRSJzMf #FoldOn3
@WileDavid Black usually!
@christianserino @JonathanTRowe Haha. 😃
@meeshfitz Ok, leave the house and come to LA/Vegas and hang with meeeeeeeeee
The blackout curtains in my room just opened and closed on its own several times as if to exorcise this jet lag demon that’s been possessing my poor, overtired, and borderline delirious body and mind. Now for the caffeine IV drip...
@RaSZi Get some rest please!!! Glad you’re ok!
@ChillChill242 Thanks Christina!

@YoWalkie Thanks! Go Tritons!
Guy next to me in tourney says it’s the one year anniversary of him being in remission from cancer. He rolls up his sleeve to reveal a tattoo that says “Survivor” Oct. 12, 2017 and then a freshly tattooed Oct. 12, 2018 under that. Perspective at the #poker table is always nice.
EPIC. Must watch. https://t.co/YW7Id6vt9k
@Ianno8 @Azania_ @WPTSA @ShuffleUpSA @PokerGO Thanks for tuning in! I had a great time on the show! See you in the tournament!
As much as I try to strive for balance on #poker trips, I still forget to take time away from the tables but #WPTSA makes it easy. I highly recommend @TambutiLodge for people looking for an unparalleled #safari experience. Many thanks @ShuffleUpSA! https://t.co/OFz2MkKwr1
@VanessaSelbst Congrats to you guys! He’s so precious! I can’t wait to meet the little one and enjoy parenting! You guys will crush it! Much love.

A little sun by the pool here at @EmperorsPalace before I jump in the Super High Roller event here at @WPTSA. Third time in South Africa and it’s always been the perfect balance of vacay and #poker. Thanks @ShuffleUpSA! https://t.co/uXpA2nTz6n

We’re on our way! One double, then lost a small-ish pot, then doubled with AA because #skills.

@Gags30poker cc: @donut604 @GatsbyKempinho @Cal42688 glimpse into your future 40 years from now
I love being a poker player first and foremost but my love for the broadcast side keeps growing especially when I get to chat with players that I’ve played against and respect in moments such as this. Thoroughly enjoyed being on the break desk and sidelines at #PokerMasters! https://t.co/gb7TwrDYjt
@DasCoffee True
@mnpuckster I would assume leaving.
@RemkoRinkema Nice one, Remko. 😂
@TheAMalott Good one haha

@JonathanTRowe 😂
Can’t wait to check out @LiveCasinoHotel for the first time and play in their $3,500 buy-in, $1,500,000 GTD @WPT event at @LivePokerRoom! Heard lots of great things and excited to get back on the grind! See you there! https://t.co/lWryD4zbMv
Oh #Vegas. Only your airport bathroom would get shut down for 30 minutes because two girls were in there puking all over then fell asleep in the stalls. A whole new walk of shame for them when they walked out and a group had congregated waiting for the bathroom to re-open.
That rigorous #PokerMasters broadcast schedule got @Bhanks11 like... https://t.co/0eV6g5vprO
VIDEO: I’m bringing you the latest from day 2 of of the #PokerMasters $100,000 Main Event and the sweat is on! It’s down to @aliImsirovic and @badams78 in the race for the purple jacket as we get closer to crowning our champion! https://t.co/NZPN0dEapB

Can you spot the difference? @RealKidPoker joins us at the #PokerMasters Break Desk. But fear not, @Bhanks11 will be back! https://t.co/Xx4BMqWGKd
@NickSchulman Take a little break from Twitter then come back with this gem. Welcome back!
After winning my Week 1 matchup in my first time ever playing #FantasyFootball I realized the last time I was full of this much false confidence was when I won the first poker tournament I ever played after only learning the game a week prior. #imanatural 😝
@Farah_Galfond @DrJudyHo @CBS @MsVivicaFox @MsRosieMercado @ArevaMartin Perfection
@Bhanks11 @SampsonSimmons @jeffplatt I missed the search for the one you’re referring to but I can report he looked up the word “mysterious” for the Ryan Reynolds one.

Correction, I drafted Chicago’s defense. See what I mean?! 😂😂😂
@NYSportsGuy210 See? I clearly have no idea how fantasy works lol. I picked Chicago in my draft. That’s not a thing?
First time ever playing #FantasyFootball and drafted the Chicago Bears defensive line. Still can’t tell by this game if that was a good choice or not? Help? #CHIvsGB #newb

@BCsniper7 @WinStarWorld Of course! I’ll be in the Poker room for most of the day!
@danielweinand Haha, I remember that! You’re bound to run into the hand your repping sometimes but it’s good to go for it!
@danielweinand Impressed with your play on #PokerAfterDark, fwiw. 👏🏼
@FrenzyWendy467 @WinStarWorld I loved your questions and I’ll still answer them! :)
Wow this is a tough one! So many goals, so little time! I think my short term goals are just to keep staying productive and continually working on things that help me get to where I want to be as a person and in life. https://t.co/ndwNlIVucm
I have a few a year that are must plays for me. @WSOP Main Event is obviously one of them, and then from there I choose by location + value. Lately I am much more open to skipping events when I am not in the mood to play whereas before I would force myself to go to a good series. https://t.co/Oax4IPH5YA
I mean B.O. can be a little rough especially if you couple that with not enough room to hide from it! 😝 Otherwise I try not to let myself get too frustrated at the poker table because that could be detrimental to my ability to play my best. https://t.co/7PewLtVdiN
I will most likely be playing @WSOP-e this year! 😀 https://t.co/hiJptpAU7a
Yes, they are the Ace and the Ace. Of any suit. I’m not picky. Other than that I don’t really have a favorite hand or one I’m superstitious about. Although suited broadways are always nice to look at. https://t.co/QVGVC15tYL
1)Being disciplined &amp; separating your poker bankroll from life roll is very impt. Make sure you’re comfortable with the stakes you’re playing before moving up.  2)Knowing what type of player you’re up against is half the battle. Bluff calling stations less and go for thin value. https://t.co/ConIxLEQP5
I love seeing shows. Big fan of musical theatre and other forms of artistic expression. I also love spending quality time with family and friends when I’m home. Always up for anything and love trying new things! https://t.co/1W2VAVkR4C
This question is very complex to answer. First of all your mom sounds like a cool lady. Secondly, I have experienced varied treatment on all ends of the spectrum both positive and negative but I have seen positive progress in my 12 years as a pro player and that’s 👍🏼. https://t.co/Bu3dtfMBkO
For tournaments with a deep structure I think playing fairly tight and ABC in the early stages is always a good way to go. I think patience pays off when you have the luxury of long levels. Getting a good grasp of table dynamics and game flow always  helps with future decisions. https://t.co/Nm2Z0YpfdD
I will be on the break desk and sidelines for @PokerGo’s #PokerMasters in Vegas! That will be steaming Sept. 8th-15th. Next commentary gig is TBD but will keep you updated. Thanks for the interest. https://t.co/cHBi5qpUD7

@RealKidPoker I’m still down as long as it’s before 10pm these days! 😉😝
Me in my 20’s: has dinner at 10pm then goes to club after because everybody knows that the club doesn’t pop off until 1am.  Me in my 30’s: has dinner at 7pm then promptly cancels all plans made after and in bed by 9pm then lives vicariously through #instagram stories.
@AaronAtEngage Oh that James! 😉
Finally! Get your 2018 #WSOPMainEvent marathon on and catch yours truly at the feature table on Day 1B and from the booth on later days! https://t.co/rYBThCrfSm

@RealKidPoker #butwehadfundidntwe 😝
@john_cynn Haha yes I could have gone that route but I decided to go the self deprecating route instead. I will persist in insanely trying to not eat carbs on the regular. 😂
@msalsberg 😂
If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results then I should rethink starting over my no carb diet every single day because:  I. Never. Make. It. Past.  Carb O’ Clock.
@stephenab90 @WinStarWorld I hear ya! That was an excellent tournament and the no rake was before it’s time! Now most higher buy in events at big properties during big series are rake free!
@audavidb @WinStarWorld Always love having you there!
Haven’t missed a @WinStarWorld #RiverPokerSeries in the last 8 years and this year is no different! Come hang out with me over Labor Day if you’re in the hunt for some fun and great value tournaments! https://t.co/dvwNgRDv1U

@DustinLehman83 I will, thanks!

@noahjschwartz @CASuicide I couldn’t agree more, Noah.
@UNC_BBALLFAN Happy to! Thanks for the love!
@sbonger77 @EmperorAdams99 Love this advice
@DavidAnikBailey Heartbreaking
@gubanok Yes we must get rid of the stigma
@LA_Boltryk That statistic makes my heart break
@TheByzambients Yes I completely agree
@RyanHomann Actions speak louder than words and the outreach I do in my personal life is a priority to me.
@kevinz0071 Hugs are awesome!!  And thanks for your service!
@realworldpoker I don’t think it’s fair for you to determine or judge the situations I’ve been in or faced privately. We are all human. And you don’t know on any level the outreach I do for those in my personal life. Please understand I come from a place of empathy.
@ribbybruno @CardsChat Aww thanks!
@mauronieva1975 ❤️
I feel sick to my stomach thinking about all of the people who have chosen to take their life in recent months. Let’s keep reaching out and taking care of one another. The depths of despair is a scary place but nobody should have to go at it alone. Let’s be the light.
@Felix74 Hahaha that’s right! 😉
@mrstumnas Thanks Renee! Love the support!
@spewzata Aww thanks Nic! Congrats on your awesome summer and you handled yourself well!

@PlayPokerLkAMan Aww thank you Lauren! One could say the same about you!
@john_cynn You were resolute and stayed incredibly mentally composed during that epic hu battle. Even with all the adrenaline coursing through your veins you were most gracious &amp; genuinely stunned &amp; exuded humility in your victory. I’m proud to have someone like you represent us.
@greezramirez I didn’t want to predict anything but I was rooting for Cynn in the end. :)
@briankoppelman Thank you! It’s an honor to work with such awesomely talented people and be a part of the Main Event broadcast. Completely agree on Cynn. Tried to not be biased but such an easy guy to root for.
@JamesObst Posts like these make me wish there was a love button. All the best for this next chapter and you better believe you’ve got a believer in me!
@NickSchulman My thoughts exactly!
Watching the #WSOPMainEvent and think both Cynn and Miles would make deserving champions and represent the #poker world well. They have shown incredible composure, great sportsmanship and a genuine love for the game.

.@phil_hellmuth with his “hold my beer” moment during the #WSOPMainEvent last night when he captured his 15th career gold bracelet. Huge congrats to him on furthering his legacy with this incredible feat.
@zedmaster84 It’s coming!!!
@Farah_Galfond @PhilGalfond At least it was short and sweet! Can’t be that bad.
@PhilGalfond @Farah_Galfond Taking happy wife, happy life to the next level and I like it! Do you do coaching for future hubs in training? 😝
Now back to my regularly scheduled programming- back on the grind. Still a couple bracelet events left and I’m re-energized and inspired by the warriors that battled their way to the Main Event FT. Gl to all of them in their quest to become part of poker history!
It was a pleasure and a privilege to commentate on the #WSOPMainEvent with the OG’s of #poker broadcasting, @NormanChad and @lonmceachern. I still have a lot to learn and improve on, but I love being in the booth. The entire prod team both on and off camera deserves all the love.
@MarcoTedesco53 @NormanChad @lonmceachern @PokerGO @espn Thank you so much Marco! I really appreciate the support and from so early on as the HPT!
@Sparky_4u Glad you were able to catch it live! It was a super entertaining night of poker.
@scott_seiver @ClarkAS_ @tonkaaaap @NickSchulman Thanks for the love, Scott!
@ClarkAS_ @scott_seiver @tonkaaaap @NickSchulman Nick is incomparable for sure.
@tonkaaaap @scott_seiver @ClarkAS_ @NickSchulman Only nick can do what he does and it’s amazing. I’m just trying to find my own lane.
@realmikeroyster @PokerGO @espn Yes you should def watch the replay! It was a super exciting night of poker!
@JustDavies90 Haha yes I’ve done a couple in my day. 👟👟👟
@gubanok @Ali_Nejad @NickSchulman 🔥
@HuskyHockey @JJfuhreal @WSOP @espn @PokerGO Thanks Roger! I’m glad that people seem to be enjoying it because I love being in the booth!
@kobizzle24 @TuckonSports @SBlum2711 @SmokingPigBBQ1 @Bay101Casino @TwitchPoker @PokerCentral @WSOP @espn @NickSchulman @Ali_Nejad @lonmceachern Omg that bbq looks amazing!!!!
@core42 Yes, definitely. Good timing on his part based on his table image
@nemesis283 Haha we play different roles for the broadcast but thanks for the love and I’m really enjoying my time in the booth!
@mnschell @PokerGO He’ll be back on today for the rest of the FT! 😀
@BrianArd7 @PokerGO @espn Yep! Getting back on the grind for sure!
@SuitedGappers Thanks!!! I’m loving my job!
@jrflournoyjr @NormanChad @WSOP They combine at 10 players versus having two tables of 5 handed play and the unofficial FT is always one more person than the number of players that start at each table at the start of the event, so a 6 max tourney would have an unofficial final table of 7 players.
@Ironman0509 @espn Haha thanks Steve! *virtual hug*
@cavincasino @espn @PokerGO @WSOP @NickSchulman @Ali_Nejad @lonmceachern @NormanChad @Stapes @TuckonSports Tyty! We appreciate the love, and I want more Stapes too!
@mindmagi Thanks for always supporting, Jamie!
@amirandacpa Thanks Andy! I definitely try to give the best input I can and I’m enjoying being in the booth!
@BetaAlex81 Thank you so much, Alex! The support is awesome!
@Phillbe1968 The rake that Caesars takes from each player per tournament pays all of the staffing costs and believe me, the corporation does ok putting on this event. 😉
@mikeb18768 Antonio’s taking over for the rest of the FT but he’ll be awesome!
@catahoulatigers I love fries but the slaw is decent!!
@SteveoEvans @PokerGO @espn Thanks for the kind words! I love working in the booth!
@bojanglesmm @PokerGO Thanks Chris, I appreciate it!
@Jessicamyidolxo I don’t think you can fold either way, but it is such a sick spot to be in with both of the other players definitely having the top of their ranges. Thanks for tuning in again!
@LakewoodAce @WSOP Thank you Anthony! I appreciate the love!
@RealJerryConner @lonmceachern @PokerGO @WSOP @Ali_Nejad @NickSchulman @NormanChad Thanks Jerry! It was an exciting night of poker!
@KingJoeCross @phil_hellmuth Phil has my utmost respect and he knows that those who love him poke fun at him in jest. Maybe you just lack a sense of humor? 😉
@dweb77 Zhu wasn’t in early position. He was facing an open and a flat and with so many shorter stacks than you it’s very important from an ICM perspective to shove there and increase your cEV and not have to put a lot of chips pre and fold on bad boards. Stack preservation very impt
@imjorman @WSOP @PokerGO @lonmceachern @NormanChad Yep, that’s when we’ll be on!
We outchea bringing you day 7 coverage of the #WSOPMainEvent. @NormanChad, @lonmceachern and I will be on the call on @PokerGo at 10:20pm ET to be continued on @ESPN 2 at midnight ET. Join us for the play down to the final table as we get closer to crowning a new #poker champion!

@JesseCallsPoker @PokerGO 😂😂😂
Day 5 coverage of the #WSOPMainEvent continues on @ESPN 2 right NOW! I’ll be on the call with @NormanChad and @lonmceachern delving into the intense #poker action with hole cards up!
@JenBrewster1 @WSOP I love it!!! I’ll be on the lookout!
@lounews There are definitely some pros who don’t enjoy sitting at the feature tables because they feel like it gives too much of their game up with hold cards shown, but nowadays most pros understand that it’s a part of the industry and are pretty happy or at least fine with it.
@lounews Hey Lou! So the table draws are randomly assigned the night before then the producers look at all the tables to find big names that happened to end up at the same table and then choose the feature tables that way. Sometimes it’s just one big name that can carry a feature.
@ZGarrow81 We watch it on the delayed feed to protect game integrity
@seanrmccauley Thanks, much appreciated, Sean!
@Alexterra03 Thanks for the kind words!
@sundanceca Thank you for the advice!
@SeanCar_michael Tyty Sean! I’m having a lot of fun doing it!

@RandyAKss @espn Thanks for the positive feedback, Randy!
@melissalvla @lonmceachern @NormanChad @espn @WSOP Thanks Melissa! Always happy to hear your take on things!
@briankoppelman @Stapes As a fellow poker geek, I hear ya! Glad you’re tuning in and I think with Kitai and Esfandari at the feature, we should see some interesting post flop hands.
@x_Sleez @WSOP Around 30 min
@seanrmccauley @lonmceachern @NormanChad No, unfortunately not. Just happy to have had the opportunity to play and it’s onto the next! 😊
@RandyRexy55 @seanrmccauley Definitely haven’t called any players straight up “bad”. I’m here to give commentary on the play and that’s what I’ll do with the understanding that it can be subjective. 👍🏼
🎶 We’re in the money, come on, my honey 🎶  Day 4 coverage of the #WSOPMainEvent is live on #ESPN today from 2:30-6pm ET. I’ll be in the booth with the great duo that is @lonmceachern and @NormanChad. See you then! https://t.co/qBDawWohff

@mryocum @Deputysd True but I have a soft spot for fireball
@JenBrewster1 Aww thanks Jen! I’ll keep my eye on the prize!
@AlanPerryMO Thanks so much Alan!
@Sam_Wilson3737 Thanks Sam!
@grinder881 Love my ho’mies!!!
@GT13Dr Yes definitely with broader economy but there are also a lot of part time Poker players that are heavily into crypto and there were times when BTC was at its peak that we saw a direct correlation in bigger buy-in events $10k +
@BigGirlPoker @espn Aww thanks Donna! 😘
@markc_psu Thanks! Appreciate that very much!
@queensfull @NickSchulman @Ali_Nejad @JamieKerstetter Believe in the ME it was 4%
@RichPcola With all due respect Rich, I am allowed to share my perspective on the experiences I’ve had at the table and I think my record speaks for itself that I haven’t shyed away from competing because of it. You trying to tell me I can’t do both is part of the problem.
@Deputysd @WSOP @lonmceachern @NormanChad @PokerBrat Hey Scott! Long time! Hope you’re well and god you’re watching the coverage!
@dweb77 @Ali_Nejad @NickSchulman Ali crushes his job!

@BobMatherPoker @Ali_Nejad @phil_hellmuth @YouStake @PokerGO The love and respect is mutual, Bob! I know you were just giving props to YS and Phil but I just wanted to make sure you knew that I wasn’t being mean about it. Glad you’ve been tuning into the broadcast and enjoying it. 😊
@TisonJohn @WSOP 😂
@pokerprogreg71 Thank you I appreciate it!!
@ItsSinco Aww you should have come up to me either way!
@MichaelCScot Haha Asian genes run pretty well in the aging department
@bigbullshitter @NickSchulman @PokerGO Glad you like us both! Nick is awesome!
@Islanders1932 @PokerGO We commentate on a delay so that game integrity is not compromised. 😀
@WayneSisk1 @PokerGO Thanks Wayne!!! I appreciate it!
@FourBetBluff @shaundeeb @PokerGO @Ali_Nejad Right?!! Too liberally used imo
@sdshark @PokerGO Haha fortunately I wasn’t!
@TheReader23 I understand your concern completely, Nancy. It’s hard to know what someone will say when it’s live and you can’t censor or stop in time.
@RTKabuto @phil_hellmuth Omg he so did, didnt he?!!
@ScottLJC @PokerGO Haha yes, I became aware shortly after! 🤷🏻‍♀️
@SamiamntxHorner @PokerGO Thank you Samantha! I appreciate the positive feedback!
@LeighHintz @PokerGO Thanks Leigh! The entire production and broadcast team is awesome and it’s a honor to be a part of it! Hope you keep watching!
@AlexHodges @PokerGO Thanks Alex! Hope you keep tuning in!
@BobMatherPoker @Ali_Nejad @phil_hellmuth @YouStake @PokerGO Hi Bob, definitely don’t think I was chiding, I said one word that indicated I think the markup is too high which I think is a fair opinion but also I understand a subjective one.
I may not be in the #WSOP Main Event anymore, but at least I get to be the filling in a @NormanChad and @lonmceachern sandwich in the commentary booth today. We will be on @ESPN 2 from 6-9:30pm ET tonight. Feel free to tweet at me, looking forward to hearing from y’all!
@CDBusskohl3 @Ali_Nejad Will do!
Catch me on @PokerGo commentary from Day 2C of the Main Event now! https://t.co/rAS2Wurzsz
@Ali_Nejad @BJNemeth We all love ya, Beej! Always great to see you.
So I had a TUI (tweeting under the influence) moment... 🤣 https://t.co/vV0y2aaPcy
Oh and obv this to wash it all down. Good night, world! https://t.co/LhtFpv3eMp
The real bad beat of the day is that I ordered and paid for two extra Cane’s sauces and they weren’t in the bag. cc: @tjurk44
We made it! Watchu know about this? But sadly, no personal touch with this delivery but all in all I would say my day has turned around quite nicely! https://t.co/vCCJxcEdZw
Ok now I’m super amped for what the next delivery will bring. Keep y’all posted!
Update: Stayed up long enough for the first delivery and she straight up brought me a handwritten card with my food! How did she know I needed a little pick me up other than the fact that I ordered a fried chicken sandwich with extra pickles??? https://t.co/bKBRm38cSA
You know you busted the #WSOP Main Event when you’re tipsy by 10pm and ordered postmates from two different places and can barely stay up to get the delivery. Welcome to some real talk right now. 🤗
@TiniePopcornPD Thank you! Strong mental game is super important to me!
Just a little #WSOP Main Event reminder that this is a real treat for rec players and pros alike so above all else, enjoy the ride. Let’s try our best as a community to make it an enjoyable experience for everyone! Check out my IG story https://t.co/KE4wPYAnz4 for an inside look!
@PhilGalfond Huge congrats to you Phil! Lots of love for you and @Farah_Galfond and great year this is shaping up to be for you both!

@ShaunDegraff Hi, huge fan of the Shaun DeGraff band. Are you guys still playing gigs anywhere in Vegas at the moment?
I may not have won #TheAmazingRace but I feel like a winner every time I’ve ran late for a flight and still somehow manage to catch it by the skin of my teeth. As I board the plane breathless I’m just thankful for this priceless life skill. #amilliondollarswouldhavebeennicetoo
Hope to see you guys at the Women in Poker Hall of Fame induction ceremony and luncheon on Tuesday, June 26th at 11am! It’s open to the public and you can get tickets here: https://t.co/BqqvHWnYJY https://t.co/RPmObVPWFo
@jeffplatt Haha I don’t believe in jinxes! Nice chatting with you too!

@wienjeremy Congrats!!!! That’s awesome!
@pokerkat @barrygreenstein @WSOP I actually needed an ace on the river against Barry and it didn’t come. I guess a 9 would have worked too. 😉
@LAseattle74 Nice to meet you! Good luck and thanks for the support!!!
@810ofclubs @SIMONDEADMAN @donut604 You guys are right. On further assessment I have to downgrade my original score to 1.3/10
@donut604 3/10 and I have a pretty low bar when it comes to your dad humor.
Well put, sis. https://t.co/hMhsnMLCh2
@beckcpo I meant that people should reach out to those that they feel like might be needing support, and not the other way around of the people who need the support having to reach out, but I definitely see your point and agree that from that side it can feel that way.
@aaronhendrix Thanks for sharing your thoughts Aaron. I hope we can all be more impactful in the ways others need most.
Reach out. Ask questions. Really listen. Pick up on subtle cues. Show up. Be there. Love, don’t judge.  My heart breaks for those who feel like they have no other options.
@Lance_Bradley Cheeseburger and animal style fries with extra spread
@Bhanks11 @UncleRonAA Happy Birthday cutie!
@DanSmithHolla Please do, I’m always looking for new go to’s post walloping.
@DanSmithHolla Smokeshack and cheese fries obv. You have a better rec?
World Series of eating super #healthy &gt; intermittent fasting &gt; keto &gt; yoga &gt; personal trainer then after busting out of three tournaments for two entries each in one day postmating Shake Shack at 2am. #wsop  Sidenote: Do not leave your In-N-Out &gt; Shake Shack commentary pls 😉

@SampsonSimmons Attn: @GatsbyKempinho #ilovebagelbites
@Beadil @PokerGO @cada99 @WSOP @Annette_15 I certainly didn’t &amp; wouldn’t disparage her or her bracelet. What she did was amazing &amp; a feat to remember. We were simply discussing whether WSOP Europe and WSOP should be grouped as one entity or two seperate series. I have the utmost respect for @Annette_15 #dontbeinstigating
@PokaPaloma 😂
@JDBossHogg @PokerGO @Ali_Nejad Omg you remember lucky!!!!
@pvault2 @PokerGO @Ali_Nejad Thanks so much! Hope you had fun at the tables!
@TonyPettersen I don’t think it would be a walk in the park, but I certainly would feel comfortable with my game in a FT situation. :)
@51centdraw @Ali_Nejad Yep!
@alrochette Thanks! I appreciate it! Hope you keep tuning in! :)
@jcwestcott @Ali_Nejad He’s a live reporter reporting on hands for @pokernews and @wsop

@hankmartin5 @WSOP @PokerGO @dude904 @cada99 @Ali_Nejad I think you missed the joke I was trying to make, I said I’m not the one to go to because I don’t know what the cool kids are saying these days implying I’m not cool but hey, maybe that wasn’t as funny as I thought. 🤷🏻‍♀️

@MichaelJosem @Shillibier @WIPHOF I was shown this and also had my management add a clause to my contract stating that I would at anytime be able to hire a third party auditor to ensure that the new company and owners were doing everything by the book. I appreciate your concern.
@MichaelJosem @Shillibier @WIPHOF Hi Michael. My time with UB came after it was under new ownership after it had changed hands from the previous operators who were involved in wrongdoing. I asked to be shown documents proving new ownership and that none of the old parties were still involved in the company.
@Haley_Hintze @WIPHOF @PokerLupe Thank you Haley! You rock!

I know I’m in the Czech Republic when beer level for the locals start three levels before play ends for the day.

@PkrConsultantJ @phil_hellmuth I was not referring to live reads whatsoever. I was referencing the way your opponents view your comfortablility/presence in this setting.
@PkrConsultantJ @phil_hellmuth I never said how big of a factor or role it plays but it is a strength 100%. I don't think any wizards would disagree.
@PkrConsultantJ @phil_hellmuth Having a very strong live presence and a lot of live experience is absolutely a relevant and important skill set in a tournament like the ME
@Covers_Vegas @Covers Of course! Happy to share the story!
@Marxmon186 @KaraOTR @MaxJSteinberg Thank you so much for the kind words!

@Stapes @PokerSampson Not sure if they give contracts to people who don't even know what a phase tournament is. 😏
@PokerSampson I watched this 10 times already and I suspect the tally will only increase by days end.
@Firaldo87poker @kittykuopoker @DannyN13 I just took aces to the flop 5 ways and I managed to win at showdown on KKQ109 so I might have a drink now because that's worth celebrating!
@Firaldo87poker @kittykuopoker @DannyN13 Lemme see how it's going by the next break but good chance I'll be in.
@KingDrue17 I flopped broadway with AQ and my opponent had a set of jacks. Run out was KJ10xx no flush possible.

Driving behind a truck carrying manure for the last 10 minutes on a single lane hilly &amp; bumpy road. Time to find out how good I really run.

Listening to Sam Smith on the way to church is the equivalent of pre-gaming before a big night out. #pre-churching #preachsam #soulfulsunday
The struggle this morning to open the bottle of Advil I strategically placed within arm's reach of my bed last night is very real.
@209twitch But I live in Los Angeles...
Steady bringing The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (@MsLaurynHill) back into rotation. 16 years later this album is still the truth! #onrepeat
@violadavis You are such a compelling actress and it is truly a pleasure to watch. You are amazing in How to Get Away with Murder!
@DannyZuker @msalsberg Well I think a mandatory alcohol quota will level the playing field a bit so consider that implemented! 👍
@DannyZuker @msalsberg Ok, def only referring to him as DaZu from now on. Let's all get together for a home game so we can tell what's what!
@DannyZuker Clearly Eric didn't steer me wrong with the follow! Your mastery of 140 characters is enviable. Your poker game though? TBD!

@FirstLadyPoker Thank you so much, Linda! You have always been so incredibly supportive and it means so much coming from you! See you soon!

It's a sad day in L.A. when the airport gift shop puts the Clippers gear in the window display &amp; the Laker stuff way in the back. #bandwagon

@johnnylodden Yup re-entry counts. Dinner on the line and since I'm going to win I'm going to request some Dom Perignon with dinner as well.
@johnnylodden Last longer Mr. Lodden? That way when we get heads up at the final there will be more to play for! 😉😛
@mrazpoker Good luck! Will a beer on me alleviate the situation some?! :)
@mrazpoker That's a great question. I'm not sure? You have to ask the tournament director. What's your table number I can send him over.
@reggi_17 You're so welcome! Glad you got the check! Best wishes to Bambi and the entire family!
@DaleJBuchanan Thanks! Regardless of that life is good! Very grateful for everything! 😀

Guy orders 3 screwdrivers on a 5AM, 48 minute flight. Don't know whether to be impressed or worried. Throws up in barf bag. #theresmyanswer
On such a short work trip that for the 1st time I was able to check in for my return trip as I'm checking in for my departure. #23hoursonly
