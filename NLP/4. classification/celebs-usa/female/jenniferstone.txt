@alex_riina That‚Äôs fair, considering not all diabetics take insulin or are dependent on it. Still it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that no one should be without something they need to survive because of others trying to exploit the necessity. Why the issue still needs to be addressed.

Forensic nursing? Well that's cool.
THANK YOU for addressing this and giving it the attention it deserves. #diabetes #Insulin4all https://t.co/YDpsb4Iv0O

@kendallfireeee Ummm when is your birthday and why did I not know?!?!?!
My favorite nights? Lying on my floor, listening to records having conversations so great that you forget what time it is.
@Missjflar @TheRachaelE @selenagomez Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è I wish you all the best with your journey.
I swear! @ThisIsUsWriters makes you think of every relationship you‚Äôve ever had or will ever have in your life. Makes you grateful for moments. #yourecrying

@HardCatholic Check your personal DM's.
@HardCatholic I am talking about the reality of an individual (to which existentialism refers). Their perception is their reality.
@HardCatholic ‚Ä¶and therefore ultimately informs their actions. Our world and knowledge is a result of the actions of its inhabitants.
@HardCatholic Therefore, perception takes precedence over science, because it is how an individual understands their world‚Ä¶
@HardCatholic ‚Ä¶from those basic tools we are all assigned. Perception molds how one views scientific laws like gravity...
@HardCatholic Moral absolutes are set in place by a conscious and collective religious virtues. People can create their own moral code...
@HardCatholic Reality is a collection of parallels in personal perceptions of the masses. Part of the reason our current reality is a mess.
@ylleKResagaS I am now dead.
@HardCatholic It isn't irrelevant. I do believe reality is mostly an internal truth. Personal perception effects everything to the viewer.
@HardCatholic To those with the discipline to commit to their chosen ideology, there is an end. It isn't easy, but it is possible.
@HardCatholic To define what philosophy one chooses to submit to. It's the intention to follow a means of their choosing.
@HardCatholic The very definition of existentialism is that submission is a personal responsibility to define for oneself and to follow.

@8bitBIG I didn't think it was, but thanks for the clarification. :-)
@FewReal The fault lies equally on both sides. It is not just women's fault. Men are equally as responsible despite what you believe.
@8bitBIG It's a shame that the women you've known haven't appreciated that, but there will be one who does. Please keep it up.
@FewReal Not always the case. Sometimes that's an excuse men use to treat women that way. You're in charge of your reactions, regardless.

Call me Pollyanna, but I believe in smiling at strangers and anonymous acts of kindness. Little things can be the difference someone needs.

Oh you can't please everyone, but you do your best to make a difference in someone's day no matter how slight.
If you're going to be called a bitch in this world for knowing who you are, you might as well change the definition.
I use bitch to turn that usually derogatory term into an empowering one.
To me a bad ass bitch is a woman who know she is, what, she wants, and does what needs to be done without neglecting the needs of others.
@PoutyScouty @WeddingCatcher I could totally see it!
@heyitsmattbaker Combine the two and you really got something!

Masculinity is not measured in physical attributes. Masculinity is measured in how much a man can make a woman feel like a woman.
