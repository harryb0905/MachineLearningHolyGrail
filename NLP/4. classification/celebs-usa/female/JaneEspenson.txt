@showupforthis Jane Lynch and I are gonna stare you down. Stay out of the Jane lane.
@OKBJGM The TV I watched growing up. MASH, Barney Miller, The Odd Couple... not a child in sight, humor/drama, lived-in characters. Always loved a poignant moment, and these shows had 'em.
After I finish a draft, before I turn it in, I like to print it out and take it to lunch. Seeing it on the page, far from the screen, is somehow very different. New options present themselves.
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE! Hope you got a lot done!  I did!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  Go go go!
Let's do a WRITING SPRINT! 1 hour of focused work starts in 8 mins at half-past the hour. Are you in?
@bonniegrrl @chustoo It’s gonna take a lot of dogs that size to make that fur coat she’s been wanting.
@NuttyMadam Thank YOU!  I did too!
@AVNEETSAYS Oh yay!  Thank YOU for joining!
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE! Great work!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE! 1 hour of focused writing starts NOW. Or use it for any task!  Here we go go go!
@NuttyMadam Perfect!  Welcome!
@jennifermuro Yay!
@AVNEETSAYS Cool!  Welcome!
@AWilderRide Yay!  Welcome!
Let's do a WRITING SPRINT! 1 hour of focused, uninterrupted writing (or any kind of work) starts in 11 minutes at the top of the hour. Are you in?
@ScottLinnen @pumpkinshirt It's still "Honest, I see you" to me.
@jsampancake I find this ironic.
@BuzzFeed Hello! I got Janet and I couldn't be happier about it!
@JohnMichaelMcD I recall saying something about giving characters one trait that cuts against the others.  But the way you've phrased it is much better. I usually write for characters created by others, so I'm no expert. Give it a try. If it works, yay! We got lucky!
@JasonKirkSBN Jane Goodall?  Well, she is 84.  And, no.  No I could not.
@GrammarGirl Thank you!  This is a word I always misspell so badly that spellcheck can’t help me!
@THEKarlaPacheco @bnacker Yes. I’m in.
@kfury @JoCoCruise Some year, I hope!
@JoCoCruise Captain Berry Trifle Oakland
@jtabrys I agree. That sounds soothing and probably good for a dry complexion.
@1ceFan That was all your personal magic! Congratulations!
@AndyRichter @NateSilver538 I know it's got "ski" in the name, but every time I drive past this store on Santa Monica, I get all excited that it's gonna be a fondue joint this time. https://t.co/ag9KfBM0hW
@meganamram @meganmram How are you not verified?! Outrageous!
@klawls I went to the doctor's this morning. It was normal.
@patriciasnyder Wow!  Congratulations!
@marcbernardin Whoaaa!  Nice!
Ancillary WRITING SPRINT over.  Great work, if anyone stayed in for hour two.
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  I'm staying in for another hour!
WRITING SPRINT STARTS NOW! Launch into one solid hour of concentrated writing (or work on any task)!  Go go go!
@cmdrsue YOU ARE VERY WELCOME!
@itsmoniwood Welcome!
@potenspuella Me too!  Need that jet fuel of a sprint!
@MarlaJaneLynch Perfect!
@joss Whoa!  Yes, welcome!
@julieannewight Nice!  Get ready!  It's almost time!
@jeanthebean7 Yay!  Welcome!
@thetzechun Jealous-
Let's do a WRITING SPRINT! Starts in 10 mins at the top of the hour!  1 hour of focused furious writing starts soon!
@marcbernardin grr arghh
@ArianaGrande French onion because I'd like to be given an all-over layer of cheese.
@Secretoriginz Oh I've been scooting everywhere since those came out. Only biked today b/c I couldn't find a scooter.
I rode one of those rental bikes today. It's been a few decades, but I remembered how! What am I supposed to compare that phenomenon to when what I'm talking about is actually riding a bike?
@LouisPeitzman I misread muting as nutmeg and was already composing an enthusiastic tweet of agreement.
I didn’t enjoy my lunch very much today, but I don’t want to blame the five cookies I had first. Workarounds?
♥️
@StarUni97 @daveshumka Oooh.
@BoingBoing https://t.co/tglDoE0xrZ
@bnacker Ahhh. Yes. They're terrifying.
@bnacker https://t.co/QYsKGMvlCU
@jaugustrichards NICE!  Congratulations!
@SFGate Oh no!
@QueenLesli Yes we can’t!
@GennHutchison Hang on, we haven't even tried the Boy Scout Cookies yet. I'm hopeful.
@SethGreen HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
@stamos @mikeylikestv I just finished! So good!
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE! 1 hour of focused work on any task! It's easy because it's only an hour! Starts now! Go go go! (Or time shift this to when you need it!)
It's almost time for the WRITING SPRINT! Go make some tea or whatever!
@ChrisG_NSF Yay! Welcome!
@SupermanAlf Glad to hear it!  I need it too!  Welcome!
@jillbillpill Cool!  Welcome! Hi!
@jeanthebean7 Yay! Welcome!
@RagingRainbow Me too!  Welcome!
Let's have a WRITING SPRINT! One hour of totally focused work starts in 18 mins at the top of the hour. Pick a task and jump in, knowing others will be working, too! Are you in?
@TheFienPrint @sepinwall Friend Of Michelle Obama, right? I think a lot of us thought that.
@Secretoriginz @HalSparks Froot Poops #AwfulCereal
@everycolorbot good job
@KitMoxie @countmystars @marcbernardin The callbox at the front of the building is broken, so if I call in food, I'm going to have to run all the way down, which is way too much work. But I can't go out in this weather, so I might starve.
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Great work!
OMG It's here. It's WRITING SPRINT! 1 hour of fast-n-focused story-forward work starts now!  It's fresh funky fun and it's so on trend! Go go go!
@jillbillpill Yay! Welcome!
@ChrisG_NSF Perfect!  Welcome!
Just jump in at half past the hour if you'd like an hour of focused work on any task -- doesn't have to be writing. It's easy because you know it's just an hour (and once you're into it, you might not want to stop!).
I need a WRITING SPRINT! Are you with me? 1 hour of focused work on any task starts in 10 mins at half past the hour.
@bonniegrrl @ChineseTheatres That's beautiful! There are great ones in Vegas too!  I had a piece of leftover Vegas casino carpet as my living room rug for years -- just threw it out this year. There's nothing cheerier!
@mmfa How many people even remember what they’re referencing? https://t.co/8hut9ZFNsI
@QueenLesli This is why I admire you so.
@rolandsmartin @doubletree @HiltonHotels That's terrible!  Do you have an iron in your room? You can iron the bottom of the bedsheets where your toes go!  Wish I had a better suggestion!
@THRtv Casted?
Don't believe the caption. It's a crock. https://t.co/ifNYziAy1o
The clergyman who got the chance to baptize a bigfoot baby printed posters to publicize the event. But then he realized he needed a bigger font.
@LivBartlet It is the only one, in fact! They had very few freelance scripts that year.
@DanielleNicki I would never look at you sideways!
@emilynussbaum Oh no! Saturday straight into Monday?!
@AlanScott707 “Meet Sunday, press. You’re welcome!”
It’s the “Welcome to Sunday” bit that’s weird, I think. We don’t really welcome people into days. Days happen.
“Welcome to Sunday. It’s Meet the Press,” always sounds backwards to me. Shouldn’t it be, “It’s Sunday. Welcome to Meet the Press”? Or is that on purpose?
@ErukaMoseley Good for you!
@MiklCraw4d Oh my god, me too.  Best in the biz.
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Great job!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  1 hour of focused work starts NOW!  Go Go GO!
@jeanthebean7 Welcome! Hi!
@Kressel__H OOoh!  Ambitious!  Go go go!
@sdarancette Perfect! Welcome! Once that hour starts, it's no Twitter-checking for us, of course. Head down for an hour.
@ErukaMoseley Cool!  Welcome!
@vfarmstrong Great!  Welcome!  Just jump on in for an hour with any task -- doesn't even have to be writing.  It's easy because it's just for an hour.  We'll start in 15 mins!
@IreneBrownstone I ship Spuffy. It wouldn't be an easy relationship to maintain long term, but I'm rooting for those kids.
Surprise, it's a WRITING SPRINT! Starts in 22 mins at the top of the hour. 1 hour of totally focused work on any task. Are you in?
@FlakedAndFormed Agreed. I loved that DuPars.  Breakfast for dinner plus gooseberry pie.
@AmazingPhil Do it.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsBETTER Dude. I don’t have a baby.
@NatalieAbrams Ooh!  Congratulations!
@marcbernardin @EWTimStack Oooh!
@GazeHoundAstrid @cmdrsue Lily Lavacake
@LZGranderson Congratulations!
@SMASEY 7
@qikipedia Dear god, but how would that happen?
@pka_Chrome @ImpactImagine Oh my -- let's see! Don't second guess it. Just be plain and direct about what makes you unique as a person and as a writer. And remember those may be two entirely different things; your writing is enriched by your background even if you want to write about aliens.
@MellowMarketer Thank you!
@QueenLesli Hahaha! Take what you learned about what doesn't work and start over! It's a terrible process.
Can that be the second hour of the WRITING SPRINT over with?  So soon!  Enjoy your day, Sprinters!   Great work.
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Great work!  I'm staying in for another hour!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  1 hour starts now! Go go go!
It's easy to focus intensely for an hour b/c you know it's only an hour. Works for tasks other than writing, too. Just jump in if you want, or time-shift your hour to whenever works for you!
Big writing day today, so how 'bout a WRITING SPRINT? 1 hour of focused work starts in 6 minutes at half past the hour. Got your own project to do? Are you in?
The office chair mullet.  Business on top, party on the bottom. https://t.co/gZVCx6MDVO
@GrammarGirl We always enjoyed the Canadian production staff on Once Upon a Time talking about Rumplestiltskin's "degger".
@shadowfirebird Yes, better.
@KitMoxie Better!
Is anyone else catching themselves singing “suborning perjury,” to the tune of Dana Carvey’s “chopping broccoli “ song?
@LeeGoldberg Need them!  Hey @Pringles , where can we get these?
@viewingfigures I love it!
@RealMichelleT No such thing as too early!!  Dig in!
More gifts from @Lipton!  Thanks so much, you guys.  Sharing this with my writer colleagues — except the personalized vessel.  Mm, love that Turmeric. https://t.co/OOzDvHfHWs
@robertberens Good god yes!  I didn’t know I needed this but yes.
@ThatEricAlper I begged you to get some therapy.
@Jody_Houser That's awesome.
Just paused a documentary on simplifying life and minimizing possessions to buy mulitpacks of soap and trash bags from Amazon. Doing it right by doing it totally wrong! #OnBrand

@Secretoriginz @writergeekrhw Oh man, of COURSE!
If you're considering a rewatch, we are in that rare part of the style cycle when the winged eyeliner on original Star Trek doesn't look weird.
The self-satisfied nod of a woman in a TV commercial who's just cleaned her grout with the swipe of a sponge?  Let's all do that when we finish writing a scene.  Yes.  Ha!  NOD.
@natemcdermott Oh boy.  Yeah.
@natemcdermott Is the character named Mae, or is the singer pronouncing "me" as "mae" to get the rhyme to work?  (Either way, it might be problematic.)
@bnacker Yes of course.
@tinymantras @ArielDumas OMG Those!
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Whew!  Great job!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  1 hour of focused work starts now!  Go go go!
@rbripley Great task!  Welcome!
@LisaDiDio Yay! Welcome!
@ChrisG_NSF Perfect!  Welcome!
I'm doing a WRITING SPRINT!  1 hour of totally focused work on one task.  Starts in 7 mins at the top of the hour.  Jump in with your own task if you'd like!  (Doesn't have to be writing!)  Are you in?
@rbripley @stevendeknight Chiquita says not to.  https://t.co/IO9j2qI56l
@stevendeknight And let's not even talk about avocados.  They give you, like, five minutes.  I have to go to work, avocados!
I bought bananas.
@BenBlacker @Tallychyck Yay!
@BenBlacker Just making sure you know @Tallychyck
Forgot to buy bananas.
@BrianKarem https://t.co/XV9AnStz38
@AlanScott707 Sounds legit, actually.
@BLeisner Yes!
Someone remind me to buy bananas tomorrow.
@KayaJones Is it lunging at me?  Other than that, it looks good.
@amabian @mental_floss Nice!
@tfortx @mental_floss Perfect!
@mental_floss "Infested" is such a loaded word.  What about "-laden" or "-covered" or "-flavored"?
@Pirates @HerUniverse Yay!  Congrats to David!
@JesseThorn Or, to put it another way, is each person 59% happy on average?
@markhumphries Oh!  This is fantastic!  Thank you!  It’s so... pointless!
@everycolorbot gross
@bnacker They came up through vaudeville, I imagine?  I mean, except Ned who had been a child film star. Honestly, I think they were just born entertainers.
Thank you, Twitter!  A few lovely people found it!  It was called Phyl and Mikhy! https://t.co/wmMn13ak88
@STabenkin Yes!!!  That’s it!!!  Thank you!
Yes!  Thank you! https://t.co/lb7vZL7zFM
@victoriadecapua Nope.  Half hour sitcom.
Trying to think of the name of a sitcom from the late 70s or early 80s, I think.  Newlyweds. American wife, Russian husband. Athletes, they'd met while competing at summer Olympics. Searches finding nothing. Anyone?
@JohnWDean Why do we keep tossing around these fake quotes?  What he really said is so much more dramatic: "If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher."
@joshgreenman Whitney Houston, "I Will Always Love You".
@geekgirldiva Or having two famous parents.
@rolandsmartin @TheAmericansFX @PrimeVideo Raising my hand.  I recently binged it and I love it!
@Celeste_pewter I’m good with that.  &lt;nods sagely&gt;
@Celeste_pewter What if some “wall” money - say enough for some fences and maintenance - could be traded for an upgraded ACA more like its original design but with new branding to make it enticing?
Xmas gift rec: The Beautiful Book of Exquisite Corpses from Gavin Edwards.  I was fortunate to a be a part of this write-your-own-story experiment, and anyone who gets it will have the same opportunity. Great creativity booster.
@LouisPeitzman If the show is Cats, then that's a Catsenjammer.
@FastCompany Why in the WORLD would talking too much about Star Trek alienate women?  Also, there's no such thing as talking too much about Star Trek.
@FastCompany In recorded history?
@jonrog1 I had no idea!
@whowantssoup @AkilahObviously So Stefon is Piggy?  Checks out!
@Julie_Twaddell True!  Get that fun!  But collecting is pretty smart, too.  Wish I had those comic books back.
WIsh I'd looked out the window more when I was a new baby, because there was some seriously vintage-looking stuff out there.  Babies!  Look out the window!
@BlueHope47 YES!  It does!  That's exactly the kind of put-off-able task that's perfect for sprinting!  Get in!  Make a choice!  Get out!  Onward!
Oh my goodness.  WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  I was engrossed!  Great sprint!  Hope you got a lot done!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  1 hour of focused work begins NOW!  Just jump in and work fast because it's only for an hour!   GO!
@jeanthebean7 Hi!  Welcome!
@JesseStern Yay!  Welcome!
@AlanScott707 Yes, you sensed it. Welcome!
Let's have a WRITING SPRINT!  Starts in 15 mins at the top of the hour. 1 hour of totally focused work on any project -- it doesn't even have to be writing!  You'll be amazed what you can do in an hour!

Oops -- overshot the end a bit.  WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  If you can't do the full 90 minutes of today's session, try an hour, or even 30 minutes.  You'll be amazed at the power of short sprints.  Starts now GO GO GO!
@OnceUponMyFury The writing spirit helps you do that "writing spring" into a writing sprint.
@GermanCityGirl Yes!  Welcome!
@AviQuijada Whoop!  Great!  Welcome!
A writing sprint is a motivational tool.  It's easier to do hard focused work (doesn't have to be writing), knowing it's only for a short period of time.
Supersized WRITING SPRINT!  Starts in ten minutes at half-past the hour.  90 MINUTES of focused work!  Are you in?
@FastCompany Is it proofreading?
@Lipton The turmeric tea is a huge hit!  We all love it.  Thank you, @Lipton!
@winnersusedrugs @garywhitta Yes!  And THAT is only one letter off from fiend chicken, so watch your back.
Yep. https://t.co/kXRWyX9HL9
@annehelen This Butter Chicken -- fast and easy and packed with spices.  I make it allll the time:  https://t.co/ZnCoIRAMGz
@Benjammins @Lipton And a bright yellow blanket to match the turmeric tea.  It’s a lovely haul.
@mrgavinedwards @PenguinBooks Fantastic!!!!   This makes me so happy!
@robertberens Do it.
Thank you so much @Lipton!  The whole writers’ room will enjoy the free tea and other fine things!  (I needed a new mug!) https://t.co/CL8b8Jbfl3

WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Good work!
Okay, here we go!  WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  One hour of focused work begins now.  Go go go!
@MoonWolf95 Don't breathe too deeply, there are particulates.
Remember that the glory of the WRITING SPRINT is that it's only for an hour, so after you're done, you can have dinner (west coast), go to bed (east coast) or have lunch at your desk (Australia).
@NotSidJo Welcome!
@jillbillpill For a lot of people!  Sunday night's all right for writing!

Let's have a WRITING SPRINT!  One hour of total focus on any task you pick (doesn't have to be writing).  Starts in 15 mins at the top of the hour.  Are you in?
Yes.  Train your replacement.  It’s how we move forward with new voices.  RT @naswho: This.  So much this.  Your ideas could be a dime a dozen but your way of relaying them is yours.  Open the door for others to use their voice to share the ideas we hold dear.

@AudreyTCarroll chug chug chug!
@JhinnuaE Any task you've been putting off.  Try to use the whole hour and to eat with focus and intensity.
@EMayrhofer Ooh!  Go go go!
A WRITING SPRINT is a motivational tool encouraging short bursts of intensely focused work on any task -- doesn't have to be writing.  You'll be amazed how much you get done when you know it's only for an hour.
Saturday night's all right for... WRITING SPRINTS!  1 hour of focused work on any task starts in 10 mins at the top of the hour.  Are you in?

By the way -- If anyone receives an email purporting to be from me -- don't give them your credit care number!  Hearing of a scam using my name.

@FastCompany I don't see how this belies their potential, as the caption says.  It looks to me like it confirms it.
@michlosangeles I LOVE THEM -- can't even detect the rage!
WRITING SPRINT complete.  Sort of.  More to do.  So much more to do.  This isn't over.
I'm going to WRITING SPRINT my face off.  Starting, like, NOW.  Top of the hour-ish.  Going for a face-ripping two hours.  Join if you can, no time to wait.  This is it, guys.  No starting gun.  Just an air horn I'm setting off NOW.  Write like this bus is gonna explode. GO.
@LindsayHWrites No worries!  Good luck!
@everycolorbot Yes.  Excellent work.
@LindsayHWrites Sure! Try https://t.co/T7rQwsWi8a or similar. The WGA Library will have some. You can try reaching out to the production itself. Also check ebay and Amazon -- I see many Big Bang Theory scripts there right now, for example. And ask your prof -- they'll have connections on shows.
@BittrScrptReadr Oh my goodness!  That's crazy!  Yes, I spent a lot of time there this summer.
Oh man, the Times and the Post are going at it. https://t.co/l7wLpEilVo

@AndyRichter I sing along to it on the radio and don't stop when the ad stops.  It's Kars for Kids till I get to where I'm going.

Cute little quake -- at least where I live.
@cindymclennan @Benjammins It looked cool at an angle, but seen directly— nope. Looked like a bunch of strangers in a mundane setting.  So weird for the setting.
@Benjammins Isn't it?  I don't know those people!  Total strangers to me!
1. A very nice restaurant.  Hey, what's that painting there to the right?  Is that... 2. something pretty by Toulouse-Lautrec?  Yes?  No! It's  3. a photo of some people picnicking with a big bottle of Fanta.  Surprise! https://t.co/5Ht57jnxUj
@msmorganjarrett @ChuckWendig Good!  They're already on my list!  Yay!
@ChuckWendig Inspired by your annual celebration of heirloom apples, I'm going apple picking with my friends next month. Yucaipa area of CA. Any orchard recs for us?

@WriterRand Not at all!  It’s all making me even more of a Scrabble purist.
@WriterRand WordCrossy?  I’d be surprised.
@Leesandersmyth They also don’t take butt or ass, which also have harmless homonyms.
All right, I accept that when I'm playing a widely-marketed word game on my phone, that they can exclude certain sexy words from their list of playable words.  For the children.  But I must also firmly assert that CROTCH should not be one of those words.  Crotches for family fun!
@charliejane Yes.  Like the random freak bit of bell pepper on my pizza.
@ForecasterEnten I love cheese but often order pizza without it.  I like the sauciness without it.
@snnc Same Time, Same Place
@LeavittAlone No.  This would have been from writers assistant.  Tamara Becher.

@tommyleeba Tom, if you want it, it's yours!  Text me!
@TreyStokes Yup.  I see it.
@guybranum @Realeugenelevy It is indeed!
So I guess what I'm saying is, @Realeugenelevy -- are you looking for a really surprising gift for Catherine O'Hara? https://t.co/bLhh8Ia0Xy
I no longer have the space for this enormous painting!  But it's too nice to trash (it's by https://t.co/gCBXAn3KrK ) and too damaged to sell and too heavy to ship.  Goodwill, maybe?
A few years ago, I purchased this very same painting, very cheaply, thinking that it was a painting of Catherine O'Hara.  (It actually shows lovely actress Faye Grant.) https://t.co/qMh8MPaUZS
This is a frame from the movie The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag.  See the painting in the background?  (thread) https://t.co/Ylz9PNuvCA

@JoseMolinaTV The writing parts -- finding the right word, the perfect phrasing, the joke that reveals character.

@Regan_Kirk It really helps.  Welcome!
@JulieJordanScot It'll fly by!

@OnMyNightCheese Check the pockets of the trousers in the washing machine.
@ChrisG_NSF Go go go!
@cmdrsue Sorry!  There will be more soon - or call up your own!
@owenmoogan I don't!  I just call for one when I need it, honestly.  You'll either get lucky -- or you can time shift one to when you need it, or host your own!  Best of luck!
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Great job!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  One hour of INTENSE WORK starts now.  It's just an hour!  GO GO GO!  (Or time shift this sprint to whenever it's convenient for you)

@TheEricGoldman Nature's way of giving you a bonus snack!
If the word "spouse" didn't exist -- and it's not obvious that it would've had to -- we'd have spent the last couple years making up a word to fill that exact semantic space while a bunch of people complained and refused to use it.
@thefilmgoer @klawls It’s a different story each season, not each episode.  I think that’s always how it was conceived.
@HerUniverse Congratulations!   Great job!  ♥️

@stevendeknight I'm a big Veep fan, too.
@OnceUponHerFury Writers and actors absolutely do, since it's the quality of the pilot that's the main determiner, and that's their work product. But other factors are huge -- does it fit the network's needs, how good are all the other pilots, is it affordable, etc.
@feliciaday I ate two kinds of Cheetos today.
@tobiasjayson @ddale8 Yes.  I wrote a bunch of draft tweets all about the effing Madagascar Plan -- so glad someone else mentioned it.
@lincolnparkzoo @potenspuella It's only 2PM.
@joeycee317 Oh I love them!
@BuzzFeed Without a comma like that?
@Humancipator35 Hi.  Can't say I've consciously based any characters on my dad, but I know that my own voice creeps into all the characters a bit, and that's definitely shaped by how my father thought and spoke.
He brought me to his lab sometimes, and we’d laugh along with all the “freshmen are getting younger every year” jokes that his students would make.  Happy Father’s Day to all the dads who let their kids play with the “toy” molecules. https://t.co/ECO602QsUC

@baddestmamajama The stork line isn't in the lyrics for the movie version, btw.  They made it something about baby clothes instead.
@baddestmamajama Stomach or belly?  I thought it was belly?
The line in Shuffle Off to Buffalo:  "Some day, the stork may visit and leave a little souvenir," is about a baby.  But, my goodness, it sure sounds like it means stork shit.
@InkTankGirl Yes -- great point, and then you get to feel accomplished, which helps.
@MattMitovich Oh yes.  And a very good French/English pun in that episode, too -- delighted me as a child.
@bonniegrrl Yes good!

@AnkeSchoenle Yes it does, especially if you watch analytically.  Think about how the show works.

@JaneEdithWilson You're a hero!  Thank you so much for rescuing me last night -- I was on my last legs!  Ames High Aims High!
@NatalieAbrams @Snoodit Yay!!!   Congratulations and happy anniversary!
@blue439 YES!  So happy to hear this!  Hi!
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Good job!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  One hour of work on any task starts now.   Go go go!
@AdronBuske @wendybuske @dog_rates Yes, I saw that.  A treat beyond cheese.
@coughdrop01 Welcome!
@AdronBuske @wendybuske Cat video?  Lime LaCroix?  Marzipan?
@Secretoriginz Yes!  Welcome!  *Participants are responsible for supplying own cookie.
@AdronBuske Cheese?
@moeproblems Welcome!
You can get a lot done in one hour, precisely because you know you only have the hour.  And at the end?  Cookie!
Let's do a WRITING SPRINT. 1 hour of totally focused work starts at the top of the hour -- about 8 mins from now.  Are you IN?
@SayxK Maybe later today?  Not sure yet!
@barrelhouse @worldofhiglet It’s a compromise between one space and two— do both.
If you haven’t seen TILDA yet, get in on this.  This show is genius. https://t.co/0xpVbYantW
Yes yes yes.  Positivity will make sure you don't hurt feelings and lose out on jobs and friendships.  It will brighten your heart.  And it will help make you more forgiving of your own work when it falls short of your hopes, which it inevitably sometimes will. https://t.co/otbxIZbL0x
@OKnox I hardly know her!
@y2skot @Fascinatingpics Ahhh.  You're right.

@MayoTakeuchi @AshCrossan it was heavenly
@page88 https://t.co/msV6Auy8Oj
@AshCrossan Yes.  There was a blistered cherry tomato polenta situation at Westside Tavern in LA that I still ask the waiter about.  It was ten years ago.
@samuelpepys That’s some good news, Sam.  Treat yourself!
@gifthorsedenist @DrewZachary True and true!
@DrewZachary HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🎊🎂🎈
@ponamgaudium aww!  That’s wonderful!
WRITING SPRINT (extended) COMPLETE!  Great work!
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  But I'm going for one more hour!  You're welcome to keep working alongside me if you'd like!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  No tweeting, minimize distractions.  Just focused work for one hour starting now! GO GO GO!
@prophecygirlHQ Yay!  Welcome!
@AnkeSchoenle Of course!  Time shifting is a good idea!  Welcome!
@potenspuella Welcome!
Note that a WRITING SPRINT doesn't have to be used for writing.  You can edit, knit, clean, code... it's great for any task you've been putting off.  Overwhelmed by the world today?  Work, creative or not, can sometimes be a wonderful escape.
I don't know about you, but I could use a WRITING SPRINT!  One hour of focused work starts at the top of the hour (about 9 mins from now).  Are you in?  You'll be amazed what you can get done in an hour if you do only that!
@SusanLambert Contemplative.
@VorpalPen @OroroPro Whoa!  Omg!
@tward34 Oh dear!  Glad I could help!  Feel better!
@ThompsonMaggie brilliant!
Someone put a lot of thought into this headline. https://t.co/2e04AtSkRR
@Kiala Ha!  Like Hamlet could get himself together long enough to do that.
@anguaji I don't know.  I didn't just see a performance or anything.  It just suddenly occurred to me.
@beach650 I didn't either till I took a Shakespeare course in college.  The prof told us and the whole class sort of went ohhhhhhhh.  And of course it's bugged me ever since.
@OroroPro Me too.  Harrumph.
You know, when Juliet says "wherefore art thou Romeo?" she's not asking where he is. She's asking WHY the guy she likes has to be named Romeo -- a guy from that family hers is feuding with.  So everyone needs to stop looking around searchingly. Stop it.
@phoefsutton Yep.  Had that!  :)
@accessonline Kinda angry?
@jenniferdaniel @TypographicsNYC I use the playing card heart ♥️ instead of the usual heart ❤️ because of its richer color and because it’s less often used.  Trying to convey more emotion.
@ruckin_ If you left the phone "off the hook," it would make noise for a while and then give up and just lie there dead.
@dcexaminer "Pranksters"?!

Today I stumbled across a metaphor for life.  If the doughnuts that come with the pretzels on top don't have custard inside, buy the custard doughnuts and add your own pretzels.
@bergopolis That's remarkable! I think it would be hard to find a lot of writers who haven't been fired/not asked back at least once. (Thank you kindly, "Something So Right"!)  That's a very cool achievement.
@politico “Saying”?  I didn’t hear it.
@KregHunter Hmmm.  Ancient Greece, maybe?  But language barrier.  Maybe Jane Austen-y England?  Can I pick the future but it’s the specific future of Star Trek?
@sepinwall @RollingStone Oh wow!  Congratulations, that’s outstanding!
@AlyssaRosenberg @MattGertz That’s a baby!  Good job!
@jmhatala oh wow, did I say that?  That’s good.  I was nervous.
@GeoffyWilson @GeoffyWilson I know!  “Corresponds with”?!  Surely any of us could find a more idiomatic way to render that in English.  Maybe, “is like”?
@OzLady41563 @HartHanson If I had a tail like that, watch out!

@TVMoJoe Money is the biggest decision.
@TVMoJoe Okay.  1. The pants thing is often true.  2.  If I'm not mistaken, the Love Boat cast never won a single game although they played many times.  Let's not let Fred Grandy off the hook.
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE.  Great work all!
WRITING SPRINT starts now!  1 hour of focused work.  Go go go!
@meltreger Ooh!  High tech!  Welcome!
@roanneba You got this!  Welcome!
@sdarancette Yay!  Welcome!  It's not actually a competition, but I'm placing a wager on you anyway!
@mjinmichigan Glad to hear it! Welcome!
@YueSimpson Oh good!  Welcome!
Let's have a WRITING SPRINT!  1 tiny hour of focused work on any task starts in 15 mins at the top of the hour.  Are you in?
I just saw my own tweet and thought, oh good, someone agrees with me.

@JoseMolinaTV I definitely don’t consider myself a showrunner, so didn’t vote, but I agree with you, for whatever that’s worth!
@kcdyer I can see it.
@tvoti They probably did some of the catering or something.
@DrnllMjr Do whatever works for you.  I believe it's smart to know what your movie means -- what you want to say.   Then however you get yourself to a story seems okay to me.
@dgct2 Thank you!  I was just a small, proud part of the team.
Are we all doing this Monday or...? https://t.co/RrLlQ6KJjM
@NotLikeFreddy yes!  Only script, not book. All the time.
@hannahbeeblogs Aw!  Thanks so much for watching!
@Herpreet_Grewal Thank you!  That's so kind of you!
@agtfrench Thank you!  I love that one, too.  Definitely my favorite.
I can't believe it's finally here!  The Once Upon a Time SERIES FINALE is TONIGHT!  I have never before spent 7 years on one show, and it's so gratifying to have been there from the beginning to this wonderful conclusion.
@acofell @HugoAwards Hi!  What a great picture!  You were nominated -- I had been nominated the previous year, I think. Great fun!  Let's do it again!
@BlasianCyborg @ABCNetwork @OnceABC  Aww!  Thank you!  ♥️
@kellyoxford Try walking so far away you can't hear it and then re-approach with it playing?  That worked for me once.
@JaneEspenson @CloeCouture omg yanny twice.  Then laurel.
@CloeCouture Laurel.  Absolutely.
@TheFienPrint Would watch.  Absolutely.
@Vmarshmellow Is it possible there's a small piece of snack food lodged under those keys?  I mean, it happens.
This restaurant is packed!  It’s like everyone and their mother is here.
@charliekirk11 Why the confused face?  That sounds right.  A trend is easier to see over 10 years than 24 hours.
I just looked up "tummy time".  I was sure it meant blowing on a baby's stomach to make fart noises, but it doesn't!  Glad I discovered it before some baby figured out I don't know the hell what I'm doing.
@FiveThirtyEight upbringing
@MedinaAlvino yes!  And it doesn’t even have to be writing!  Some people clean or knit.  Any task you need to get done can be helped with short focused work sprints.
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Great work!  Isn't an hour amazing?
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  GO go go!
@michlosangeles YES!  Go go go!
@B3tan_Tyronne Oooh.  Eurovision!  Enjoy!
@NotSidJo Isn't it?  Welcome!
@jeanthebean7 Welcome!
How about a Saturday WRITING SPRINT?  Starts in 13 mins at the top of the hour.  1 hour of extremely focused work on any task.  It's only an hour.  Are you in?
@FastCompany Try and stop me!
Enjoy tonight's @OnceABC!  On now, Easters!  Up soon, Westers!
@ChowBellaPHX @phoenixnewtimes Yup

To those of you on my personal email list -- don't click any link you seem to have received from me today.  Bit of a hacking situation.  Addressing now.
@christinadirkes Right?  I can't believe I didn't notice.  It just simply never occurred to me that anyone would do that.  I guess I thought the car was magic!
Neighbor, by the way, is an unfailingly cheerful immigrant, part of a young couple who seem to be working multiple jobs and looking for a way to thank me for the use of my extra parking space. I'm moved by the kindness of his gesture.
Came across my neighbor in the parking garage this morning as he was just finishing *washing my car*. I'm now thinking back to other times over last 2 years when my car was surprisingly clean.
@bnacker @JElvisWeinstein Yep.  Because it is good and kind.
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Great work, everyone!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  One hour of totally focused work (on any task) starts NOW!  Go go go!
@Scaevola67 Perfect!
@BobbyCJohnson Yay!  Welcome!

@duchessgoldblat *curtsey*
@duchessgoldblat Here!
@georgianalee Also, thank you for saying "lying," not "laying". So few of us left.
@georgianalee YES!  That is precisely the image I have!  A hospital bed.  They have to marry quickly before he dies.  And he can't have a metal ring because of all the MRIs.
What body part even is that?  Lower arm?  Why is she holding it like that? https://t.co/J74uYBD01e
@MirandaSajdak @wildchildhood @alinebmckenna @bergernight Aww!  Thanks so much!
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Great work!
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE ... or is it?  Good work to all.  I'm going for another hour!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE! Anyone can jump in. It's 1 hour of work on any task with no distractions (no Twitter).  How much can you do in an hour if you sprint? The hour starts now! Go go go!
@BakerPatrickJ Um yeah
Just cuz I'm pouring a big bowl of M&amp;Ms in the morning, doesn't mean I'm having M&amp;Ms for breakfast. I already had breakfast. This is dessert.
@sdarancette You are!  You're early!  T minus 12 minutes.  Welcome!
@PopCulturPriest Well, thank you!
@Stephs_tweeting YES!  Welcome!
@La2zarini You gotta do it!  It's just an hour.  Welcome!
@georgbacker Georg!  Welcome!

@BuzzFeed squid shaming
@markisham no.  I didn’t know!  But it sounds fab!  Have fun!

@tarsuperbus a great one!
@BenBlacker and always has
@askwellesleywmn That’s how my dad explained it.  But how long does it stay correct when only a few native speakers use it? #DescriptiveNotPrescriptive

@colchester1 Ahh!  Got it.  Interesting!
@colchester1 Wait -- are people planting that every year?
@KarenKilgariff OMG that's amazing. I'm gonna make a friend just so I can do that and say that.

My thought on TV #StaffingSeason. You may screw up a meeting. I've done so MANY times. But view each meeting as a peek behind the curtain of the making of a show -- come in cheerful and curious -- and eventually both sides will hear that CLICK. It's TV; remember it's fun!
@ChuckWendig @ukulele_chick I like all those things!
@ukulele_chick @ChuckWendig Is that bacon, sweet pickle and peanut butter? BRB, gotta try. That sounds amazing.
@deirdrestatham Go go go!

@MysticKid Yay!  Welcome!
@YueSimpson Me too!  Welcome!
A WRITING SPRINT is a motivational tool. Knowing that you only have an hour, you maximize your output during that hour. Give it a try! Use it for any task you've been putting off; doesn't have to be writing.
Time for a WRITING SPRINT!  One hour of really focused work on any task, starts in 12 minutes.  Are you IN?

Oops -- I got so caught up I overshot the ending of the WRITING SPRINT!  You can stand down if you wish -- I'm going for another hour!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  One hour of focused work! No stopping!  Starts now!  GO GO GO!

If you're talking about someone who served on a submarine, and you pronounce the word sub + mariner instead of submarine + r, then you don't have any pronunciation left over for when you want to talk about someone who is beneath a mariner.
@Secretoriginz I know. You'll remember it again at random moments in your future and it'll be like learning it all over again.
@InkTankGirl Well, I don't have to deal with her very often.  Everyone else is very nice!
@BuzzFeed Let's talk Emperor's New Groove before we start handing out this title willy-nilly.
Introduced myself to the stranger who parks next to me at work -- "Oh! We're car neighbors," and her reaction has me thinking maybe that's not a thing.
This sounds amazing. https://t.co/4OrCFiwWjz
@thetakeout @TheAVClub yes
@emilynussbaum Exactly!
@emilynussbaum And the thing is, that's not even how that construction goes.  To dismiss the assertion, you don't say, "I'm more a spy than he is," you say "He's no more a spy than I am".
@louisvirtel I was in the same bathroom as her one time.
@MelissaIsAD that was not intended as a reference to wonderland
@MelissaIsAD she could be anyone the viewer chooses to imagine. It was unspecified and not speculated about by us, but the show also belongs to the viewer.

@JoseMolinaTV Yes, also, comedy was all the Disney fellowship accepted at the time, so I happily committed.
@MelissaIsAD I lost count, not sure.
@rwb76 no. A spec script, used as a sample to get jobs on other shows.
@mreills Frasier: ad for his show put Doctor in quotes. Seinfeld 1: jerry is made self-conscious by his cleaning woman. S2: Elaine writes about Jerry, making him self-conscious. Hmmm.
@MelissaIsAD She was a minor witch, presumably a supporting character in someone’s story. Not meant to reference a specific witch from folklore.
@JaneEspenson ...and Friends.
@julieplec Nice!
@TheEricGoldman Perhaps that would have been better.  It was my worst one, never actually used as a sample.
I spec’d TNG, Seinfeld, Roseanne, Frasier, Larry Sanders, NYPD Blue, and Coach. https://t.co/s7FYUeTKAL
@JoseMolinaTV I had two Seinfelds!
@SusanMCummings Yuck. Okay.
Ugh. The dryer just stopped. Someone go fold the clothes, okay?

WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Great work, everyone!
WRITING SPRNT!  One hour of totally focused work.  Don't check Twitter or emails, just work fast and hard because it's only for an hour!  Starts NOW!  Go go go! (Doesn't have to be used for writing.)

This is shocking news. I am shaken. Suzanne was young and successful and vital — someone everyone knew or wanted to know.  All my thoughts are with her friends and family. https://t.co/zQpeq1vUhn
@TheTrekspert good question— if the program doesn’t provide a way to ask the question, it’s probably good to play it safe.
@michlosangeles See you tomorrow -- combobbed or not!
@BoingBoing Gummy Bears under the stairs.  Malted Milk Balls inside the walls. Lemonheads beneath your beds.
@OMGmelizabeth I am indeed!
The PA system is playing "Everybody Dance Now" at the Burbank airport. So how come no one is dancing? I mean, no one else.
@Secretoriginz Exactly.  It was the squeeze bottle full of caramel that made me look away -- I don't want to know what's coming out of things that look like mustard bottles.
I just looked away from the barista making my coffee. Didn’t want to ruin the mystery.
@stevendeknight Agreed!  He's the best Mr. DeKnight I know.
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Great work!  It goes so fast!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  One hour of focused work starts NOW!  Go go go!
@WandererKirsty Yay!  Welcome!
@coldantlerfarm welcome!
@alexevans91 perfect!  Welcome!
@jeanthebean7 I can always count on you!  Welcome!
Let's do a WRITING SPRINT! Starts in 13 mins at the top of the hour. 1 hour of fast-and-focused work on any task -- doesn't even have to be writing!  Are you IN?
The look on the horse's face tells me he talked the illustrator into this whole idea. https://t.co/ActnbMdhVr
@JillianSed Look in the fridge.
@wittywriter I’m at a meeting, but you can go!  Go go go!
@BuzzFeed I watched until the egg wash part... you are misunderstanding my commitment to taco night.

I read this caption and for a moment thought "we have got the baby on" was a Brit expression for celebrating a big event. But she was just in the middle of saying "we have got the baby on the way." https://t.co/koX46EkQJv
@SInow I am okay with that.
@HoarseWisperer You know what bugs me most? The "gotten".
@MistyMcClure_ @serathegamble @WGAWest Don't feel as if you NEED a mentor to get started. Apply to writing fellowships, write strong spec pilots, get an assistant job, create content, find your own way in, then find a mentor along the way when you find a boss/co-worker who likes your work.
@RobGMacfarlane my father used to call that “voting with your feet”.
@SarahLerner I think they mean marquee?
This interview is amazing. RT @APEntertainment: Cloris Leachman says at 91 she doesn't have a stack of scripts to choose from, but she's got another hit with "I Can Only Imagine" https://t.co/j1CZkb4DOe

There are disk pics. https://t.co/VBMNLEB6BS
@garywhitta Ha! Worth finding!
@bnacker @garywhitta @BenBlacker yes of course!
@garywhitta That's wild! Ahh - I think maybe @bnacker had it up on a web site for writers.
@garywhitta You've read my Frasier spec?! Amazing!  You should see my old Roseanne!  ;-)
@garywhitta Thank you!  Can't think how I missed following for so long!
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Isn't it amazing how fast an hour goes?!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE! 1 hour of work on any task you choose -- doesn't have to be writing. Employ total focus and minimize distractions. It's only for an hour, so it's easy. Give it a try!
@abbieeeee_x This should help! Welcome!
@MrTayJ Thank you for joining in! Welcome!
@daniellenuss It's only for an hour. If it's really bad, you can commit to a mini-sprint of 30 mins.  Been there.
@alysewax Ooh! Do it! Welcome!
@BobbyCJohnson Of course! Welcome!
@jillbillpill Good timing! Welcome!
@georgianalee Hi!  Welcome!

@studiomogura Perfect!  Welcome!
Remember, it's called a WRITING SPRINT, but you don't have to use it for writing -- cleaning, knitting, editing, coding... any task, especially one you've been putting off. It's just for an hour; you can do it!
Let's have a WRITING SPRINT! 1 hour of focused work on any task. Starts in 11 mins at the top of the hour.  Are you in?
Duck! It’s a petunia! https://t.co/tliQ8jbynf
@chrisopotamia isn’t it amazing?  I’m alway surprised, too, at how effective it is.
Hilarious writer @NellSco’s book is out! “Just the Funny Parts”.  I’ve read it and I know you’ll love it. A must-read if you’re curious about TV behind the scenes — or life.
@RealMagicDave I missed it, but I'm gonna launch one of my own later.  Congrats on a fine sprint!
Oh no.  I'm just seeing this now.  What a terrible loss. https://t.co/SAGeR7gBJV

@TheMarySue The Associates
@officermankorn It is very much helped by the passage of time. The work feels almost like someone else’s.
If you have the time to do this, do it. You'll be amazed at how your mistakes, and possible solutions, become clear with fresh eyes. https://t.co/UcTshV3VR5

I overshot the end of the WRITING SPRINT!  It's past time to stop.  Great work, everyone!
Writing sprint commence!  Go go go!  1 hour starts now!
@AnkeSchoenle Yay!  Welcome!
@jillbillpill Perfect!  Let's do this!
Who needs a WRITING SPRINT?!  One hour of focused work on any task.  Doesn't even have to be writing.  Starts in 5 mins at the top of the hour!  Jump on in, it's just an hour.  You'll get so much done!
@charliejane I want it!  You don’t have to eat it!  Send it to meeee!

@_antoinetterose Thanks so much!  And Happy off-cycle Thanksgiving!
@annehelen landing in Vegas at night.
@MayaRupert Yes!  Garlic butter + sourdough bread.  Heaven!

Quite often, when I see the word reboot, I think it says "robot" and I get all excited.  I mean, a Queer Eye robot would be amazing.
@froonium I'll take a hard cider!
@JewelsJules13 You can reach out through @M4PR_Mel Thank YOU!

@KathrynFellows4 aww!  Thank you so much !
@pattonoswalt Wait until they find out about Pennon Teller.
@phoenixnewtimes Okay.
@jillbillpill It was unlocked. Key fob was in it.  I could've stolen it, but that's not my way.
I put my groceries in someone else's Prius just now.
@LouisPeitzman watermelon
@ChrisG_NSF That's huge!  Congrats!
@patriciasnyder Oh, I'm glad to hear this!  I do the same thing, sometimes.  If the easier part turns out great, it's incentive to untangle the tricky bits!
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Great work, everyone!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE!  One hour of total focus on any project starts NOW!  No tweeting! After, you can rest and tweet and eat a cookie or such.  Go go go!

@Janina Hearts!  Sorry I missed you!
@DrnllMjr @Dannystrong @joss @shondarhimes @jengrisanti @CallieKhouri Write until you're inspired by what you've written.  I know it sounds pat, but I think there's something to it -- write what you'd want to read.

Season seven of Once is going to be the last, and we are cooking up a fantastic series finale for all of you. It's very rare for a show to last this long, and all the credit for that goes to you lovely viewers. Thank you!
@rainnwilson @HartHanson I hear good things about Scott, too.
WRITING SPRINT COMPLETE!  Great work, everyone!  I hope that was helpful!
WRITING SPRINT COMMENCE! (Welcome to the Tide-Doritos SuperBowl First Half Writing Sprint brought to you by Dodge.) 1 hour of focused work starts NOW!  GO GO GO!
@selindsey Yup.  I'll back you up.
@selindsey Yes!  Sleep is also crucial to the process.  Use the whole hour and sleep with focus.
@TakeABookAlong Yay!  Welcome!
@amypond27 Yes!  You can time-shift the hour to whenever works for you!
@jillbillpill Welcome!
@Jawiin Thank you!  Nice of you to say!
How about a WRITING SPRINT for all the not football fans?  1 hour of focused work on any task (doesn't have to be writing).  Starts in 12 mins at the top of the hour.  Great motivational tool.  Are you in?
@LindsayHWrites Best of luck to you!
@LindsayHWrites You need spec scripts (spec pilots mostly) anyway, to get into the fellowships. I believe in trying everything at once -- submit, apply, pitch, get a PA job, go to panels, join writing groups, make a web show, write more pilots. Do it all!
@SergioSirsay Ludlum knows what's up.

@Eryn_Turner7 I love it.  Yes, you should do it.
@weird_sci Also, fashion.
@eliotpeper YES!  I applaud you.
@BobSaroya And yet you clearly advocate spelling reform.  An odd combination.
In spy novels, when the hero goes into the bathroom to stash the gun, retrieve the cash, put on the disguise, etc, they never actually use the toilet, too, as long as they're in there. I feel this is a mistake. Take the opportunity.

@RealMagicDave Writing sprints -- 1 hour (or 90 minute) writing sessions.  One task, total focus.  It's easy to start because the time is limited.

@PSawyerSchue I wouldn’t want to try.  Impossible to look at own-show objectively. That’s why specs are never used as samples for the same show.
@MaxBoot @Kasparov63 @NYDailyNews I can find it in myself to be truly angry at someone who hasn't made any secret of his white supremacist views.
@NBCNews @TODAYshow This headline doesn’t fit the piece, which is about detecting attempts to hack, not evidence that it has happened.
I have two important things I need to get done this evening.  But both have a first step that involves getting up and finding something elsewhere in the apartment. So, I dunno.
@YNB ♥️

@jimsciutto @potenspuella I agree it feels wrong, but I can’t figure out why— the analogous phrases are fine.
@jimsciutto @potenspuella Is it? The way it was phrased, the time you noticed it, the way you felt... those all have missing “in which,” but seem unremarkable.
@jimsciutto @potenspuella You don't like the way it was phrased?
@sandym1001 I know exactly what you mean and I've had similar problems.  Yet one more reason to encourage diversity in casting!

@ohhhmygiddyaunt what’s that you say?
@MattMitovich In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Bennet says: "He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all," seemingly implying a literal profession of love, no sex involved. But that's a little earlier.
I once went on a giraffe-feeding tour at the San Diego wild animal park, and touched a giraffe’s face despite being told not to.  The temptation was just too great. https://t.co/Hw2LsqcT2e

@finaldraftinc conflate is a word.
@Clairetastic I’ve solved this problem with popcorn, scrambled eggs or any kind of chip or fry.
@HIGHzurrer And, oddly, I don't think this means we need to turn away from the darkness.  The thing I love about dystopian stories is how often they are about how we can earn our survival if we hew to the good side. (see BSG, etc)
@HIGHzurrer I couldn't agree more. I've been so happy to see shows like The Good Place cropping up, and think there's a reason our little show about hope is lasting so long. There is a general hunger for optimistic fare that's starting to be addressed.
@craigengler There's a gate at both ends and a six foot wall on one side and a building on the other.  It had to go over.  I think the wind lifted it and dropped it!
@mstevens13 gate at both ends! It had to go over!

@InterruptingDad @leahfong @InkTankGirl @AdamJKarp That sounds right-- 'twasn't me!
@mr_graves I was!  I got to do it again on Buffy and it was a joy again!
@OKBJGM Hmm. I've done evil twin (tho he turned out not to be), shrink (tho it was never produced), and lots and lots of parallel universe eps -- do I get 2 for each one of those?
@mr_graves Thanks so much. I was a young freelancer and was, per usual, pretty thoroughly re-written, so I can't take much credit. But the jokes from Quark are pretty much mine!
@AndyRichter I have always seen you as a shiny light in the darkness, and I'm even more impressed now that I know more. Applause and hugs to you.
@TheEvanora that sounds reasonable
@TheEvanora you can deduce but not conclude, how about that? Is that fair?
@TheEvanora It’s just that there isn’t a right answer. We leave things undetermined sometimes not as a secret, but because we don’t want it pinned down. It’s an allusion, a shading.
@TheEvanora I think writers are of limited use in settling these things— we might all disagree on how parallel 2 stories are or are meant to be.
@TheEvanora  The scripts have to stand on their own and the characters are what you take from them. If you feel echoes of another character, trust your gut. If we left it vague, we did that so you could decide.
@TheEvanora Themes of class seem natural to the Cinderella story and we are not shaping our stories to avoid any echoes of past episodes. But we are also not purposely constructing them, so I’d say no, not intentional.
@JillianSed Me too.
@JennaBusch @PUMA If the big hole isn't the one you're supposed to put your foot in, this seems like a substantial problem.

@AdamHorowitzLA Did you try writing more than 140?  My little window indicates that I only get 140 characters, but look... if I keep typing it actually doesn't cut me off. I think we might all have 280 but the twitter apps don't all reflect that yet?
@klawls me too
I just ate so much garlic sauce.  I apologize. I’m aware that even my tweets may be a little stinky.
@Clairetastic @morgangendel @LauInLA Yes, partly because it could be about a hastily-typed crisis.

@TheEvanora you’ll have to watch. The episodes need to speak for themselves.
@PurpleSaline Yeah, I guess.  Seems more like passing it "along," rather than "around".
@QueenLesli If they were really good, they'd figure out how to make one product to do it all.
@televisionary The Associates. Profit.
@JaneEspenson You’re all making good arguments. I feel that “pass it around” differs from ... https://t.co/gej1xXdqJJ

@montanaharris96 @cptkillianswan no I remember that.
@mar_keaton @montanaharris96 Agreed that more would have been nice. We had one day, so we got what we could.
@mar_keaton @montanaharris96 ...but we put her in every scene we could, given the time we had her.
@mar_keaton @montanaharris96 Well, yes, you’re right, actually.  I’ll delete that. I forgot a few lines were trimmed for length...
@cptkillianswan @montanaharris96 I’m starting to regret posting the picture of the piece of a walnut.
@montanaharris96 @mar_keaton I don’t mean to seem arrogant.  Again, sorry if I’m not being clear.
@montanaharris96 @mar_keaton I do get why you’re upset. That’s why I reached out to express empathy, start dialog instead of muting.
@montanaharris96 @cptkillianswan I was thinking primarily of Rumple and Regina, who have their own established fans.
@mar_keaton If you felt a “screw yourself” vibe in my reply, I apologize.
@mar_keaton I went to her feed and read her tweets to try to get where the anger was coming from and addressed it as best I could. Apologies
@cptkillianswan I hear your pain. But I hope we can continue to provide heartfelt stories for the fans of the other characters.

@feliciaday This is on Amazon -- very cute!  Buy 99 stuffed Dalmatians to trail behind her in a line.  You dress as Cruella.  Done! https://t.co/Ugs4iU8i63
@daniellenuss I don't write to music, but if I understand it, it depends on the mood of the scene you're writing -- write to movie with same emotions.
@InterruptingDad @Benjammins yes!
@Benjammins Over by Team Disney near the place with the flat squirrel.
@ponamgaudium awww!  Thanks!
@ponamgaudium link here: https://t.co/3n8CnhSyJd and google for other similar programs.
@ponamgaudium Eventually, you'll have an agent submit it to shows that are staffing.  As beginner, start with studio fellowships like ABC's.
@RoseMarie4Real Rose Marie -- were there table reads for DvD show? Did you give 'em your all, or hold energy back for shoot night? Curious!
@CandyECane2 They were so adorable -- bouncing around playing with beachballs and a bubble machine and other props while their pix were taken.
Stumbled across a pug puppy photo shoot today.  This is the understudy, waiting for her big break. Careful on the stairs, leading lady! https://t.co/qB5OlMsfqo
@ponamgaudium Yes, very much so! All tv work requires spec scripts, most usually pilots, but sometimes of existing shows. Fanfic is great place to start.
@EW The slideshow format makes this impossible / unpleasant to view.
@sarahccaldwell Thank you!
This is fun... https://t.co/WFctYT6lOv
@SergeantSableye @sblomkamp @GeekandSundry @wilw So glad it worked for you!  You're welcome!
@cathelaing24 very true.
@cathelaing24 Eve Sweetser, Deborah Tannen, Adele Eva Goldberg... Maybe men have written more of the works accessible from outside field?
@cathelaing24 I think there are quite a few well-known female linguists.  Almost half my profs, at least half the grad students were women.
@jroy042 @cathelaing24 True.  I have a MA in linguistics-- don't know about cool/famous tho.
@mitchellvii It's entirely nonviolent protest-- isn't that the preferred method?

@webjournalist @Vmarshmellow Sadly, I can imagine that headline. I feel like I'm seeing it a lot now.
@MagicRealismBot @cmdrsue I feel like they'd have established base 8 as the standard.
@JakeSherman So... "I'm from America, he's from Miss America"?

@MelissaIsAD There is, I suppose, nothing to go by, since there is no answer. You can't state who is who.
@michlosangeles I know!  It's gonna be a good one.
@MelissaIsAD The episode has to speak for itself.  If something was left vague then it is perpetually undetermined.

Everyone's surprised at how much they get done during a WRITING SPRINT -- speaks to how rarely we focus single-mindedly for an hour.
Let's have a WRITING SPRINT! Starts in 16 mins at the top of the hour. 1 hour of focused, undivided work on any task. Are you in?

@JoseMolinaTV Noooooooo!
@TysonJackson01 @TheEvanora Yes, I could see that.
@TheEvanora It's okay.  BTW, most fans have a far better grasp on these things than I would.  I'm not known for my memory!
@TheEvanora I don't see any harm in it.   The material doesn't explicitly support it, but it's logical and unlikely to be contradicted.
@TheEvanora We didn't establish their last names, so we are in an exciting amorphous state in which all names are equally true.
@TysonJackson01 @TheEvanora I don't think we have the data to say either way.  But it's a good question.
@TysonJackson01 @TheEvanora I don't think we established her last name in Storybrooke.
@TheEvanora We didn't establish a correspondence or think of them in that way.
@TheEvanora The thinking didn't get that far.

WRITING SPRINTS don't have to be for writing.  Pick any task you've been putting off, and do it, and only it, for 1 hour.
Let's do a WRITING SPRINT!  1 hour of focused work on any task, no interruptions.  Starts in 15 mins at half-past the hour.  Are you IN?

@GrammarGirl @quickdirtytips Hi!  I figured you knew -- assumed it just didn't rise to the level of "need to know" for the general public. :)
@GrammarGirl @quickdirtytips On a script, an ampersand between two writers' names indicates they wrote as a team (as opposed to one rewriting the other).
@writenett Because I lined the baking pan with tin foil for easy clean-up.  But it's all my cooking!
@potenspuella it's all fine.  Everyone's good.
@potenspuella no no.  Bought it ground.  Cooked it with oregano, random spices I grabbed.  Ate it all over sink. Served with paper towel.
@potenspuella spaghetti sauce and ground pork, but lots of combos work.

@rainnwilson @AmericanAir Should be mandatory.
@Chumplet Point is, a fisk is still a fist.
So, when you use the word "fisk," you may be genuinely innocent of saying "fist," but I'm pretty sure you knew what people would hear.  4
But my showrunner took the note gracefully, pointing out that we were using the word disingenuously -- winking at the four-letter word.  3
The censor told us we couldn't say "shih-tzu" on the air.  I was incensed -- how can they keep us from saying the name of a dog breed?!   2 https://t.co/5798rIQKkP
