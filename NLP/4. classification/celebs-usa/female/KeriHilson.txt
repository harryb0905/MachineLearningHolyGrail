Being with someone who doesn’t know themselves can be as dangerous as being with someone who doesn’t love themselves.
Yes, I always say, “People lie, PATTERNS don’t.” https://t.co/TdAYeOIcdD
So...believe what their ACTIONS say they feel about themselves.
Don’t believe everything people say about themselves. But it’s not always an intentional lie. So many people really don’t know themselves very well at all.

“I prayed for twenty years, but received no answer until I prayed with my legs.” -Frederick Douglass https://t.co/DvqUgPtjC3
I’ve learned that God responds to my action over my waiting. My movement is demonstration of trust &amp; faith that as I move, HE WILL STEER. There is no fear. Whatever direction I take, He will either protect me w/ divine correction, or provide the tools to finish as confirmation.
There is a certain clarity that only occurs within His divine orchestratation. Our only job is to cooperate.
God knows what he’s doing. As you take the first step—and not a moment before—He will send someone to increase your effort.   This is how you recognize when He is answering, “YES.” This is how you know when you’re operating in His will.

I am literally surrounded by the truest of QUEENS. Too many to name. There is NOTHING like having a woman-tribe of supreme character, true hearts of service to their worlds-big &amp; small- in pure humility. Moment of gratitude to angels above for this awesome reality I’m living. 👑
Before that, I got to tell @repjohnlewis THANK YOU. For stepping in to re-write history. That we appreciate the sacrifices he’s made for us...that we don’t take for granted all he had to endure.

When ppl say “Our people fought for the RIGHT to vote, which means the l choice to participate or not.” I’m not here for the semantics &amp; lazy spins. Do you REALLY think blacks were beaten, spit on, humiliated, dehumanized, and KILLED for your right to SIT DOWN? C’mon son.
I have no respect for anyone that chooses not to vote. I despise your inaction. I don’t respect your excuses, and I don’t hear your complaints. You stand for NOTHING.
Just got word of all kinds of breakdowns here at GA polls—they’re trying to keep US from voting. We won't let it happen. Look for volunteers w/ umbrellas, food &amp; water. @staceyabrams got you! Just DON’T get out of line! We must win.   1-866-OUR-VOTE if you encounter any problems.

Friendship is the FOUNDATION of love, right? If they can’t even be a loyal friend...why would you trust them with more? Like...your LIFE?!
I don’t know why people treat betrayal differently in relationships. I wouldn’t keep a friend around who severely betrayed me, and I loved them too...so why would I adjust my boundaries for ANY other person? It’s like we acknowledge the toxicity in one and not the other...

But for the record, I do not subscribe to the notion that all men cheat. No matter what I’ve been thru, I still have hope in faithful men. Ssshiiiit, all I need is one.☝🏾
I was initially referring to men who squander good things...blessings...real, true love...&amp; try for months/years to get her back. The ones who recognized the value from jump, but still risked it. That’s stupidity, foolish. Too many MALES call themselves MEN w/ this goin on...
Nooo, TOO many good women have the same stories for it to just be about my choices. So it does make me feel the average man struggles w/ poor decision-making...from cheating to irresponsible risk-taking, improper engagement, inappropriate behavior, habitual line-crossing... https://t.co/ctkscjzM9Q

#Australia &amp; #NewZealand, though I love the thought of coming back, I’ve been made aware that someone fraudulently portrayed themselves as management here in the US, accepted a large sum of money...then disappeared from AZ/NZ promoters.💨 Needless to say, I will not be coming...

You SAY you want something, even PRAY for it, but what are you DOING? We have to move towards it. God doesn’t do EVERYTHING. Maybe he’s waiting on YOU...
Maybe God wants to bless you but your hands are full of distractions...hindrances to that very same blessing.

I said nothing offensive. Didn’t down any race. Didn’t even mention a preference. I put ol’ dude on pause purely for the sake of THAT particular conversation...directed questions to white men...just returning love to the white men who think I neglected their advances. 😂 g’nite!
Let’s settle this now before any blogs take the dramatic approach. I like MEN. Fine men. Good men. I’m single. (Annnd...deliriously jetlagged). But plz read the whole thread from my initial tweet...jokes.
Why ppl so dramatic?! 🙆🏽‍♀️😂
Lmaoooo!! Yall remember that telephone game? How did me joking about white men in my DM’s turn into “She’s dating a white man?” I’m SUPER single for the record— Idc if he’s black, blue or purple— if he’s a man of great character, loyal &amp; deserving of my heart &amp; treats me right... https://t.co/hgiWtGDIrh

(ctnd)...when I’m writing, I’m in a retrospective/introspective place. I remember the feelings &amp; the lessons. So sometimes the thought occurs...maybe someone else is out there hurting or confused, so I’m driven to share the lessons I’ve had to learn about real love &amp; self worth.
Some may assume my recent sentiments &amp; word choice indicate bitterness or that I’m still in pain. I’m neither. Pretty darn happy actually. But I write songs about love for a living, both from observation &amp; experience...and when I do...

Over these years, I’ve done a lot of soul searching. A LOT. My pain has brought me so much compassion, wisdom, maturity, focus, clarity, and a sense of responsibility to be a great human of great purpose. I care about how God sees me. I want Him to look down &amp; be proud.

OWN YOUR LIFE. If something doesn’t fit the way you want your life to go (or feel), you must be wise and courageous enough to let that go. It’ll hurt—TEMPORARILY.

My spiritual segment on the @IAmSteveHarvey Show airs today. We talked very deeply about SO MANY things, I dunno HOW they could edit 1.5 hours of all those emotions into just a few minutes!! But if you’re unable to tell from the edits, @ReginaldLewis is THE TRUTH. 🙏🏾 Tune in...
My angels were there. I couldn’t deny the signs and truths with skepticism...and you will understand a lot more about me after watching that. I also hope they post the full interview online after it airs.
Not to taint the authenticity of my posts with what’ll come across as promo, but this is on my mind because my spiritual segment airs tomorrow on the @IAmSteveHarvey Show w/ @ReginaldLewis. It was revealing, vulnerable, and emotional. If you’re interested, tune in. It’s real.
All we have to do is clear out our hearts, minds, &amp; spirits to just...NOTICE. (When they are working...to KNOW when it’s THEM). Allow them the clear space to work for our highest good. Then ask God if you are not clear what mission or message they are trying to convey...
Angels have missions. For the good of OUR personal mission...Angels guide. Angels redirect. Angels confirm. Angels protect.  Angels awaken. Purpose...Light. ✨
I believe in divine angels in the spiritual realm. Well, I happen to know they are real. But I also believe that God can awaken someone to be an angel in our lives...for a period of time, or sometimes just to speak a single sentence.
Spiritual text session with a new friend this am after morning business calls &amp; planning the day. I must work on this Sunday. But I am inspired &amp; encouraged to push forward in the face of any adversity I “perceive....” for it is never real. I wish the same for you. Happy Sunday!!
Oh man. I remember those days. Haven’t felt like “Lie To Me” since the relationship I wrote it about tho. I was suffering in silence, hanging onto ANYTHING he’d throw me, out of fear. Now I have grown to love even the painful doses of reality &amp; truth. I pray you find the courage. https://t.co/doPsiTHZ3Y

My crazy friend jus text me ki-ki’ing that I’m being so sincere abt something so trivial. But it’s not...a lotta ppl grapple w/ loving themselves or their appearance. &amp; social media prolly prolongs (or even prevents) the process for the avg young girl/woman. Hell, boys &amp; men too!
It’s funny tho, I’ve even come to the point where I even feel “prettiest” on normal days w/out a stitch of make-up/contour. Trult grew to love this honker👃🏾
Just random night time thoughts....cuz everrrrry time I post a pic SOMEbody gotta come wit that bull...(usually women 🤔🤫) ...alright now back to biz! 🖥
It’s a personal choice, I don’t judge so no shade whatsoever. And I can’t say I was never tempted to consider it when I 1st hit the scene, but never seriously considered surgery of any kind. Eventually, I learned to love every flaw. And make more flattering decisions. 🤦🏽‍♀️😂
And that goes for every other part of my body too, for the people who just gottttta find something. 🤫 No secrets here.
So 😴 of years of coming across “new nose” accusations. It’s the same big👃🏾my Grandma gave me &amp; I’m not dissin her. Some of us just learn to accept our imperfections (&amp; have discovered contour &amp; “angles”)—now I LOVE it! #RIPGrandma There’s not 1 nose I’d trade it for 🙅🏽‍♀️

When you're TRULY in love with yourself...when you've come to accept every mistake, every shortcoming &amp; flaw, u eliminate the "need" to lie
Sometimes U gotta trip em up with a fake-out "But I thought you said..." (and then lie). Just for fun. U know, cut the grass down lower. 🐍😂
Shout out to the truth tellers. 👊🏾
You just be like..."Ohh, ok I got you." (#noted). 😂👌🏾

I've been thinking out loud for the past hour. If you're confused about who I'm respecting, please read the entire series. #context
I have no real interest in politics, either...I vote out of pure RESPECT to them. #ivotedbecause
How dare you detach yourself from their suffering. You enjoy their pain every day.
They suffered so that I can be as free as I feel today. So that WE WOULD ONE DAY HAVE THE VOICE in this country that they couldn't utter.
Members of MY bloodline were hung, spat on, chased &amp; called names, &amp; deprived of so many basic human rights...
I vote for the people in my bloodline that were denied rights that I enjoy.
I know. Just don't understand how a person could be so detached from where they come from. Who they come from. The elders of their bloodline https://t.co/MZbJoQHnLj
I find it hard to respect them for their decision.
Being completely transparent, there are a few African American citizens close to me who choose not to vote. Breaks my heart.
PLEASE vote tomorrow. 🙏🏾 Visit https://t.co/R7ib9PlFda to confirm your poll location or get all the info you need. #ImWithHer #HopeUAreToo

Hillary "has real plans. Specific ideas. And then there's Donald Trump. He's not really a plans guy. Not really a facts guy either." #POTUS
"He's not offering any solutions. He's offering slogans." @BarackObama on @realDonaldTrump.
"Hillary's been in the room."  -@BarackObama
"This election is not normal by any means. This is a more fundamental choice about who we are as a people."  --@BarackObama
Nobody text me. My black President is speaking. 😩😩😩
@Stassi09 And the onions add to the flavor as well. Plus cooking rice in chicken broth--it's VERY flavorful. Don't do that to yaself!! Lol!!
Besides lime, salt, seasoned salt, minced garlic, &amp; pepper pictured, I used 3 bouillons, chickn broth, garlic powder https://t.co/Fgn4OZnzkA

NEWSFLASH::
Proud of my city &amp; mayor @KasimReed. #AtlantaProtest #ATLisready #ATLMarch #MayorReed https://t.co/pckhgg8Al1
I can't respect any black man in America who has chosen to be silent at a time like this.
Don't feel powerless. This country needs the whispers AND the yells.
I don't hv the answers. These are some ideas. But I DO know it's not too big for you. And that we need YOU TOO. Take your version of action.
If you're not closely watching or researching your Presidential candidates for their positions on everything relating to this matter...
I think UNITY is not just physical representations. I think it is also commitment to the community in permanent ways too.
Hate would not stop, it probably never will, but INJUSTICES would lessen. And accountability for these crimes would be in place and upheld.
Nothing would change immediately. The caliber of change we need requires life commitment. But in time, BALANCE would occur...
Why couldn't we occupy more criminal justice and law enforcement positions? Do them with integrity, with our heart for equality &amp; justice...
Your career-choice is a weapon.
Your VOTE is a weapon.
A "weapon" rests within your reach too. We all have SOMETHING we can use to actualize change.
...that someone bigger and mightier than you must act. I think you're wrong.
A popular feeling among our community is helplessness. That feeling is based on the illusion that the fight is too big for you to conquer...
Video phones, live-streams, social media are our most important weapons. #LavishReynolds I salute you for thinking fast &amp; finding your power
I'm so tired of hearing people say history is "repeating itself." But exactly when did it stop? I'll wait...
Don't you dare refer to this as the "current state of our country." This isn't NEW. It NEVER STOPPED happening. ONLY diff is the videos!!!
What country are you rooting for?! Don't miss the regional finals on @TRACE_Inter!! TV schedules: https://t.co/ENLH4OxAGU @AirtelTRACEMS 🎤
#AirtelTraceMusicStar Did you guys watch the #Tanzania Finals tonight? How do you feel about the winner? 🎤 https://t.co/ENLH4OxAGU
#PhilandoCastile was next. That was fast. He COMPLIED AND DIED. 💔

#AltonSterling was next.
If anything, you are turning people away from your religion this way. #tryLOVE #notHATE
I don't think it's fair to those who practice that same religion peacefully.
I will just never understand why these sick murderers claim to do it in their God's name. I don't see how this is possible OR effective.
The God I know loves &amp; accepts ALL.
I was disgusted to hear that #BangladeshAttack only spared those who could recite the Koran. The 20 that couldn't didn't deserve a life?
Are you planning to kill millions off because they were born into regions that think &amp; believe differently? What does this solve? #notGod
Are your murders changing anyone's beliefs? Will their grieving families accept your God this way? #notGOD
What God orders you to murder those who believe differently? #notGod
I'm just learning about the #Bangladesh cafe slaughter of 20. Two of the killed are students from my Uni, @EmoryUniversity. Heartbroken. 💔🙏🏾
#Istanbul airport attack still fresh, now #Baghdad! 215 families/childrens' lives taken (and counting) while shopping at a mall? Evil. 💔💔💔🙏🏾

My web &amp; legal teams are investigating to find out who is responsible, and we are taking action. You don't deserve to be duped like this.
I woke up pissed that someone is deliberately working against me AND taking advantage of the support from my fans. I will not stand for that
You know something? Over time, I've acquired the skill of not concerning myself with things I can't control.....but this morning
P.S.,  Your excitement means EVERYTHING to me. 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾

Just because you want someone to make you SMILE, doesn't mean you need someone to make you HAPPY.
We both love design projects--renovation, re-design, interior design/decor...actually on our way to look at tiles for a backsplash project.
1 thing abt me--never been prissy or dainty. Never afraid of manual labor/physical work. I get it from my mama (Minus the💄) #tomboy4life
1 thing I love abt my Mom is she's never been afraid 2 get her hands dirty! She'll lift, stain wood floors, whatever--in her red lipstick💄🙌🏾

"I've done the best work of my career, sir. The rest is up to God......"
I felt so many different emotions...Unworthy. Grateful. Proud. Afraid. Confident. Ready. I just prayed.
I was quiet the rest of the ride...
But this: When the laughter between us subsided, he hit me with, "This industry is waiting for someone like you to make things right."
Still dunno if I believe him. He was convincing but I just don't buy that it could be that random. My day's bn quite peculiar enough already
My side-eye was so scrong!! Lol I kept repeating, "Why you frontin tho?" 😂 Just to see if he was for real.
I said, "No need to apologize, I appreciate that." He turned like, "Wait, no way!! You are HER?!" I said, "Stop it. U really didn't know?!"
Uber driver playing my station on Pandora. "Turnin Me On" 🎶 I sat silently. He says, "No one can f' w/ Keri Hilson. Pardon my french ma'am."

Furniture shopping is more fulfilling to me than shopping for clothes. There. I said it.
Actually resembles the couch I wanted MOST, but really couldn't see spending $14k for it. So proud to be a patient, diligent shopper! #SCORE
I've been searching for the PERFECT couch for 5 mos to re-design. Went shopping for a desk for a diff city/home when I FOUND her! 🎯 25% OFF!

...But the good news is...  You can sow your way out of any situation!!! By planting good seeds in &amp; around it!! @AndyStanley #seeds
God says nothing you do, no seed you sow goes unanswered. EVERY good seed is rewarded with good. EVERY bad seed is punished with bad.

I'm not sayin she doesn't have serious ISSUES, I'm just sayin don't knock her intentions or discredit her efforts. @NAACP stands by her work
It is really weird tho. She took it pretty far with slave whips &amp; what not. Levels. Deep. #RachaelDolezal

A friend reminded me: The devil comes to steal, kill, &amp; destroy. And guess where he begins his mission? In YOUR MIND. Watch your thoughts...

Satan creates an "opportunity," suggests and coerces, but God always provides a way out. (1 Cor. 10:13)   What happens next is on you....
"F*ck your breath" to a dying man? One you "accidentally" killed? That's a new level of cold blooded. Pure evil. 💔 #EricHarris

Now that's complex. My brain documented a free-style in "real-time?" I'm fascinated on so many levels. Wishing I had those lyrics though...

Most of my textual relations are food-related. I only realize this when I'm on a strict diet and can't act (eat) on the impulses...
So basically, it was just coincidental foodie-to-foodie interaction.
I said, "It's Nat'l Pancake Day. Are you sending me this becuz you knew that?" He said, "I didn't know."
Lobo randomly text me earlier to go eat pancakes at a spot here in ATL for him. He didn't know it was Nat'l Pancake Day either! Serendipity!
I participate in all food holidays. 😋

Pretty sure I made the most perfect omelette (shrimp, kale, &amp; onions sautéed in garlic, and cheddar) ...hate to brag but it was worthy 👌🙌😋😜

No sun in my SUNday. I'm in the boof.
But the question should be, "How did I get so far away from God's voice?" Because guess what? He desires for you to hear Him!!
A lot of us wonder, "Why doesn't God speak to me? Why am I always unsure if it's His answer or my own idea? Why isn't He clear w/ me?"
Ever wonder why God whispers? Cuz He wants you to lean in closer to hear. Stop what ur doing, silence the noise. DRAW NEAR! @peopleschurchtv

Wait I kinda did cheat--was happy to cut Serge's b-day cake for dessert. Bought ingredients for a dessert I invented but I wanted to SIT lol
I always cook from scratch, no cheat dishes/sides. Not even my garlic bread. My back is still hurting, lol!!
Cooked 3 times y'day! It went: cook, clean up, grocery store, cook, clean up, workout, back to grocery store for impromptu dinner party of 6
It seems all this technology created for people to "connect" is really just an illusion. We're not closer, we're just more...familiar.
Heard that at the gym today for the first time. That line stuck out. So true though!
"Everyone's connected but no one is connecting" -Armin Van Buuren
I always feel like cooking. NEVER feel like grocery shopping. Sigh.

Meanwhile, that man AND his girlfriend are laughing at your thirsty ass--together. That's what you need to know. Have a little self-respect.
Did ALL the rules go out the window w/ social media? Don't we have more respect for OURSELVES, if not for other women? And relationships?
Why do girls think it's cute to vie for the attention of a taken man? Why don't they feel hoe-ish? When did this become acceptable?

I would have said "blind," but nobody's blind.
Ppl that fix their mouths/fingers to say it's not about race are being incredibly insensitive to the pattern that "WE" cannot ignore.
My point: I don't even wanna talk about the silly un-armed "robbery." It doesn't justify murder, even IF the officer was aware. (He wasn't).
18 year olds of all colors do really stupid things...should they be shot DEAD??

never underestimate the power of time. http://t.co/FgLzIobjdW
You can fool someone. You can fool the WHOLE WORLD, but you can't fool God. He sees you.
Be sincere with God. He is more than a "routine." He cares abt the condition of your heart, not just your outward expression of discipline.
We think we're being sincere, but when God speaks to our hearts to change something or do something difficult, we deny Him...
So many of us are not even aware that we have diminished prayer and church to just "routine" or a "performance" for others to see...
How many times can a person sit in church, ignore what they heard &amp; felt, then return right back to living the exact same life as before?
Good morning twitter!! I hope your Sunday is beautiful. You know, today's sermon made me wonder...

Life is so fragile... RIP, Paul Walker.
Can't wait to watch the @CNN special, "To Heaven and Back" tomorrow! I'm fascinated!! The preview of Mary Neal's story just gave me chills..
@russwest44. Wow!!!!!
and now let's give it up for leftovers, everybody!! 👏👏👏👏put it here👊
BIG warm thanks to Clarette for baking that AMAZING sweet potato pie for us!! We bodied that.
Oh wait, there was one partial fail....the peanut butter pie. There's always that one thing that looks funny but tastes amazing anyway! 😂😂
My potato salad was great too!! But @KayceeHilson's greens?!!! &amp; @flyKYE_12's deviled eggs?!! The rest we all made together w/ @MissKelsee!!
My broccoli casserole was just like my Grandma's!! Perfect! http://t.co/cHALhHAsal

RT: @CreoleKid: @KeriHilson Ok so how was the meal w/o mom Dad? &lt;--lil pressurized but Hilson girls killed it! Everything came out PERFECT!!
Happy Thanksgiving from my home to yours...  #triedtoironthetableclothshutupandeat http://t.co/pp0dyYzeAb
So Mom &amp; them decided to skip out on us for Thanksgiving 😩 Me &amp; my sisters are in here attempting dangerous maneuvers 😳 wish us luck!!
I'm thankful for potato peelers.
the truth feels good!!! not because it automatically does, but because it eventually does.

Confusion is Satan's playground.
Morning thought: God is not the author of confusion. He is very clear, &amp; He wants us to be clear too. Seek Him.

Be careful not to discourage people. It weakens their spirit &amp; makes them stumble. Believing in someone could make all the difference.
RT: @iCONtips: ...just because someone desires you - does not mean that they value you. &lt;--yes, KNOW the difference!!
Wishing a Happy Burfday to a true blue #KeriKrew, @Meezii!!!! Here's your #Kerimelkiss ...the wet kind, for old times sake ;) Muaaaaah!!

#VeteransDaySalute to all who have served this country...thanks for your bravery &amp; sacrifice!!
I pray for so many people who don't even know it. I don't want points or anything, I just know sometimes I could use an anonymous prayer.
CNN reports the Philippines typhoon death toll could possibly end up in 10,000's. May our prayers be with the Philippines...
Leaving "12 Years a Slave," a white man stayed behind, crying--really crying. I heard him tell his wife, "My Grandmother. She owned slaves."

But now I gotta vent. Why is the Q-10 like using an old glitchy PC?? Everything is way more difficult than it needs to be...tryin too hard.
I try tweeting from my iphone sometimes, and that twitter confuses me too...so yeah. I think I want my BlackBerry Bold 9900 back.
Honestly haven't tweeted much becuz the Q-10 sucks. And there's no uber-social for it yet. And I'm used to that. And again, the Q-10 sucks!!

RT: @JoelOsteen: When you are good to people, when you go out of your way to be a blessing, nothing you’ve done goes unnoticed by God.
Fear is bondage. Captivity. Enslavement. Get free!!!
Think of all the things fear has kept you from. Think of all the things it is still keeping you from.
FEAR pushes you into corners...away from your dreams. Away from true happiness. It makes u believe you're "safe" ...you're in fear's PRISON.
FEAR is the biggest bully!! It slaps you all around life, making you afraid to live, love, let go, trust, step up, speak up, stand up...
nothing scares me anymore. nothing.
RT: @PDCross: @kerihilson if u had the single in yo hands i would've chased u down all 5 miles and died afterwards. lol &lt;--bwahahahaaaaaa!!!
