To those in the KNOW ... SBB.   Back when we were filming #OneTreeHill, we had to put our initials on a list for crew jackets. @antwon_tanner saw me write SAB, and said, “nah.

This is unconscionable @NYPDONeill. If you do not punish officers who abuse their power, you encourage public mistrust of ALL officers, even the good guys. And thus you put both the public they are sworn to serve and the officers in danger. Fix this. https://t.co/VaommLAGjQ

Holy crap! I don’t know how I missed this on Thursday — I mean, work, but still — THIS IS MAJOR!  This is exactly the kind of news we should be focusing on and putting our time and attention to y’all 😎 https://t.co/oY5ZpCF9cS
This ♥️ https://t.co/7vfb5c6nPg
@jordanrosstv How do we bring that back? ‘Cause I’m in.
@benrsolos So simple. Yet it seems so hard for people.
AND. Let’s be real. In a world suffering climate change, sexual assault, children dying at the border and actual Nazi parties are campaigning for global political offices, THIS IS THE SHIT y’all want to spend time and energy on?? Bullying folks w/ mental health issues?? GTFO. https://t.co/eQrUq0LC7n
Being a “fan” means just that. You like someone. You appreciate their work (hello I say this as the ultimate fanboy of basically EVERYONE.)  It does NOT mean spewing vitriol at OTHER humans because of the human you like. That’s so insane. https://t.co/JIzBAsyJpZ
Point being. Pete Davidson has been very open about his mental health. And b/c a relationship didn’t work out, tens of thousands of people he doesn’t know are telling him to kill himself.  Words have real consequences. And the people who bullied him into posting this? Shame. https://t.co/lUCpahlG5u
Also. 100. 👀 https://t.co/TnEx1wbYos
THIS. To people attacking folks they don’t know &amp; stooping so low as to encourage suicide?! What is wrong with you? These are HUMAN BEINGS.  So a couple of people YOU DON’T KNOW broke up. Get the actual fuck over it. If you have nothing nice to say, say NOTHING at all. https://t.co/H8AuPDNTJL

DHS has CLOSED all legal ports of entry. So families that are fleeing violence attempt to present themselves, are turned away, &amp; are  left to search for another entry point at which to attempt asylum.   DHS has DONE this.

@DetBush @haIeysnathan That’s called “spin.” They think “oh if we take her talking about how tough the blizzard conditions were on both the cast and CREW, and amplify it, maybe we can make her seem weak and then distract from the gross misconduct she’s been clear about all this time.” It’s lame.
Whether at the border or with their intentional sabotage of our own healthcare system, the Trump administration is quite literally killing people.  (I cannot believe that’s a sentence I even had to type...) https://t.co/9AqwuPgn45

@DavidCather2 @bushslays @BossQueenSoph Thank you for your kind words, David. If we don’t stand steadfast in our commitment to truth and integrity, we lose everything. As the adage goes, “tell the truth, even if your voice shakes.” Kind folks like many of you, here, make that easier! Cheers.
@AngelaSamuels76 @nicole_hong @rebeccadobrien @rebeccaballhaus @aviswanatha A “band wagon?” When an actress is permitted to quit a show years before her binding contract is up, read between the lines.

@Lili_Lightly The LITERAL definition of a colonizer!! It’s incredibly sad that he passed, but the sheer lack of respect for a tribe, and their culture, and THEIR MEDICAL SAFETY?? Nope nope nope. Religion is not an excuse to decimate a group of people because you cannot adhere to basic laws.
Knowing that we live in a world where so many people read the headline and not the article attached, means that our media should be doubling down on clear and factual headlines.

@PCompton213 Refusing to let her rip a mic out of his hands while he’s speaking? That’s refusing to let “her speak?” He’s midsentence. So in fact she’s attempting to refuse him his right to speak... Trump sending interns to try to stop reporters asking questions he doesn’t like is pathetic.
Excellent point.  But the press should still walk out in solidarity. To attempt to silence members of press who demand you answer fair questions does not adhere to 1A. https://t.co/YPSwoh1931
You can see Jim Acosta did not “grab” this woman. He refused to let her take the mic, &amp; was so polite as to say “excuse me ma’am,” when he pulled away from her attempted mic grab. The White House is pushing doctored footage from InfoWars to blatantly lie &amp; slander Acosta. Insane. https://t.co/9MVgV8MFxb

@CLE_FIT_FAN @tomcolicchio I just can’t fathom how anyone lucky enough to make, say, a million a year pays close to 50% in taxes (when state and federal are combined) but BILLIONAIRES &amp; BILLION dollar corporations don’t? It makes less than no sense. Those taxes would cover healthcare/schools/infrastructure
@CLE_FIT_FAN @tomcolicchio I hear you on that. Truly. But so few entertainers make the kind of $$ that Trump claims every entertainer makes. That kind of wealth is rare air. But rather than support the majority who believe those who are that wealthy can afford taxes, he steps on necks to give them breaks.

@leannhanson Yes ma’am. Shitty that despite all social media presence and the ways folks in my industry open their lives to people, it’s still apparently never enough and strangers are willing to violate you to get more...
I would, in a moment like this, love to highlight an interaction with a stranger that made my day today. Kristin, you’re a gem. Thanks for being one of the good ones 💓 https://t.co/pzrxGsxFcQ
Does that sound fun to you? It sure as hell isn’t fun to me. Every noise in the house gets scary. Every random number on my phone feels like a threat. I literally don’t give a shit what someone “wants.” I don’t belong to them. Stalking unlisted info is grossly inappropriate. 2/ https://t.co/l6UnUMnUSe
That’s cute. Know what happens when my privacy or the privacy of the people closest to me is violated? I start having an anxiety attack. I don’t feel safe going outside.

The President has said that if you tell a lie three times people start to believe it. The fish rots from the head. Is it ANY WONDER the entire Senate and all of Congress on his team are no playing by his rules? They’re lying to us. For tax cuts. For $$$. Revolting. https://t.co/ZrTlszNxEG

Every garbage GOP Congressman on the news today saying they believe Dr. Ford “went through something” but it wasn’t Kavanaugh should be ASHAMED. The FBI investigation DID NOT QUESTION KAVANAUGH. OR FORD. Or ANY of the 40+ witnesses who came forward this week. Honestly. Fuck this.
If there’s anyone in your life who doesn’t understand why Brett Kavanaugh must not be confirmed on the basis of PERJURY ALONE (not even getting to the rest, of which there is an avalanche!!) show them this thread. Have an open convo about it. The law matters more than party lines https://t.co/tZf1nAgVse
Sister. It is heavy. It is awful. But it has been worse throughout pockets of history. And if those of us committed to truth + justice + actual equality give up, all will certainly be lost. We must keep going. Take a day off. Practice more selfcare. But do not give up. Ever. ♥️ https://t.co/bsxs1fNu84
@CollierSwecker Do you know about Iceland? When all the women walked out? I won’t spoil it for you. But google it. It’ll clue you in.  Then consider if you’d tell your own daughter her commitment to whatever action matters to her is “silly.” I bet you wouldn’t. If you would? You’re the problem.

He thinks men of color who are accused of rape are guilty with no proof and calls for the death penalty. But when a white man perjures himself 20 times before Congress and there are multiple women who accuse him of assault, Trump says, “Nah, I believe him.“ Revolting. https://t.co/BrAvnzBk58
The man has perjured himself TWENTY TIMES. He is not only NOT ENTITLED to a SCOTUS seat, he is clearly unfit for one. Perjury. Is. Illegal. Period. https://t.co/Qy9WN0pJvk

“Brush up on?” Bumping into someone in a bar isn’t what we’re talking about here, sir. And you know that. Don’t be glib. Unless you’ve been sexually assaulted and know what PTSD feels like, sit down. Listen. Learn. And maybe just be a decent guy. It’s not that hard. https://t.co/pxGBqaaWHj
To everyone saying “why did they wait? The timing feels suspect,” etc. Just remember Bill Cosby. No one wanted to believe it about him. It was true. And he’s going to prison. I’d wager more women victimized by Kavanaugh will vome forward. Women feel safety in numbers #TimesUp
I hate this idea that women are only valuable as they relate to someone else, but what the hell. If personalizing these women in order to imagine them as someone you KNOW who went through what they did does the trick? Do it. Can you imagine? How does that make you feel? https://t.co/YLQDyblT6b
Ford offers witnesses who corroborate her story across many years. “Interesting” that the Senators running the hearing don’t want to hear from witnesses. It’s as if ... could it be ... they don’t want to actually investigate this? https://t.co/AWq8mxfnIP
Gee, I wonder why victims don’t report. So odd, considering they are met with such kindness when they do. So many people who are willing to listen without asking irrelevant questions like “what were you wearing?” and so on... hmm. #WhyIDidntReport #ButIDid #NothingChanged https://t.co/D9IbqgZIop

What an incredible show of solidarity and strength. This takes serious courage. Hats off to all the workers who are demanding fair treatment and safety in their workplace. https://t.co/zaDSwhAOWa
@makaelahayward 💓
@baboOu__ I suspect that everyone does what they can, when they can. But I’m glad that trying my best works for you sweet babes! ♥️
@antwon_tanner I know what you meant, boo. The fans’ confusion is bc you RT a post with my name in it, but I wasn’t tagged so you probs didn’t even notice.  I reply to people every day. By choice. But not THAT troll/bot asshole w/ 8 followers who tries to shit talk my beliefs daily.  All good💋
@ctrumbore74 Let go of what? Being shamed for not doing something, which I did do? Of calling you out for being so rude? Of remembering the pain of my friends who lost family? What exactly are you suggesting I “let go” of? The irony? Look at YOUR feed. Nothing on today’s tragic anniversary. https://t.co/ljr9RzFmal
@ctrumbore74 Perhaps you could read my post about 9/11 &amp; the attached image of the beautiful memorial mural unveiled in NYC today. Your accusation that I said nothing is an insulting lie. While I won’t forget to honor the fallen, I will be appalled that you use their deaths to troll women.
“The Braves of 9/11” by Eduardo Kobra 🎨 kobrastreetart • Unveiled in Manhattan today. The painting is seven stories tall. #IHeartNY https://t.co/Bzsq1Mkfx0
@_xoxo_dannie @lindseyruthie @CherylStrayed I cannot tell you how transformative that book has been for me. I truly hope it can offer the same solace to you. Sending love. 3/
@_xoxo_dannie @lindseyruthie In @CherylStrayed’s book #TinyBeautifulThings, there’s a chapter written for a mother who lost her baby @ the 6 month mark of pregnancy. It’s one of the most profound things I’ve ever read. And I feel like I saw your tweet today because I was meant to pass it on to you ♥️ 2/
@_xoxo_dannie @lindseyruthie Danielle, thank you for this incredibly kind feedback. It’s so thoughtful and vulnerable, and though we don’t know each other, for what it’s worth I’m proud of you. What a step... And if I may... I’m so sorry to hear about you losing your baby. I cannot imagine it. 1/
@kmakell Much appreciated, sir!
@Keah_Maria This is so kind. Thank you. I see you. ♥️

@AllisonSMalone 💓💓💓
@AllisonSMalone Appreciate the clarification. It’s just a rough sentiment to come across in my feed because it instantly leads me to think, “wow, how many people are saying that I don’t for someone to feel the need to write this?” A lack of context generally leads the mind to the worst places...
@AllisonSMalone TBH, I’d love to not be tagged in tweets like this... while I’m sure it’s well-meaning, and I’m sure a lot of people are venting about my Dec schedule changing (which is beyond my control) I’d rather not know that a bunch of folks (?) are talking shit. It’s just really...hurtful.

@TowardsLessHarm @MsPackyetti Thank you for the opportunity to have a dialogue. I truly appreciate it. And I know that (if I’m putting ego aside) a critique is a calling-in more than a calling out. A chance to grow. To see more. I’m grateful. I’ll continue to try to do better. Thanks for taking the time. ♥️
@TowardsLessHarm @MsPackyetti Ah. Not my intention. Meant it more to say I stand in solidarity against the sexism all women face, and am fully aware that for my sisters of color sexism + racism compound in exponentially more difficult &amp; insidious ways. Twitter can be hard... Limits are a disservice to clarity
@TowardsLessHarm @MsPackyetti I can imagine, and I fully support you in any and all rawness, anger, hurt, and all the rest. I hope my second tweet helped clarify my position further... For what it’s worth, I see your pain and I hear you. Sending love. ♥️
@TowardsLessHarm @MsPackyetti And I believe — if I’m wrong here feel free to clue me in — that one of the best ways I can be an ally to all of my sisters is to acknowledge the ways in which their lives are affected by compounding oppression. If feminism isn’t consciously intersectional, it’s not working...
@TowardsLessHarm @MsPackyetti Not attempting to “insert” at all. I’m supporting a women who is my friend, and acknowledging that while all women are rightfully angry at sexism, I also know that my friends who are WOC are (deservingly) angry at BOTH sexism AND racism. We must dismantle both systems.
@CherryCat51628 @CynthiaNixon Because the distancing attempts are very public? https://t.co/BtcnSLUvF9
@MsPackyetti Yup. I’m thinking about a few myself. No more passes for sexism... I’d imagine the number multiples exponentially when both gender and race are applied. I say write ‘em.
NY, your election is Thursday. And apparently the powers that be are so afraid of @CynthiaNixon and the campaign she’s running — to be a leader for the people — that they’re resorting to Trump-style lying/attack tactics. Shame on them. Hints to what serious power her ideas hold. https://t.co/bDn5Vtiq3x

@Sonya0518 @Lexual__ Sonya, you are assuming the mental health standing of women you do not know. You are playing into the women-are-wildly-emotional-flowers-who-cannot-be-trusted-to-make-decisions card that the patriarchy uses to stand on our necks. Please, please read this - https://t.co/q7lWHT3EYv
@LizSeccuro I appreciate that very much, Liz. Thank you.
@Sonya0518 @Lexual__ That’s wonderful for you, Sonya. But to dismiss the needs of other women because of your own success story with birth control is to trivialize the decisions women and their partners have the right to make. Not an option for you? Then don’t seek one out. Leave others be. Simple.

@AlShal28 Not saying an enemy is a friend. Saying that if even guys like Walsh are owning the error of their ways and admitting that no one should be supporting Trump, that’s meaningful. We need opponents to see the light of truth. He’s a powerful example to them.

@Yamino @cnlester @scattermoon @sjmog1 But I WILL say that if she makes anyone of our trans fans feel more seen, or if Voyd gives them an animated icon who feels like their own, I am beyond humbled and appreciative of whatever small part I could play in that happiness. ♥️♥️♥️ 3/
@Yamino @cnlester @scattermoon @sjmog1 Also your cartoons are INCREDIBLE (pun inteeeeended!) and I am so blown away by all the work you’ve put into them!! Truly. Thank you!! The way #Incredibles fans have embraced Voyd, and so clearly get what she represents, warms my heart eternally! 😍 2/
@Yamino @cnlester @scattermoon @sjmog1 While I’ve spoken at length about my feelings that Voyd is an excellent representation of/for queer kids, I would like to clarify that if she were trans I wouldn’t have voiced her. I would’ve stepped aside to let a trans actor take the helm &amp; create her. Representation matters 1/
