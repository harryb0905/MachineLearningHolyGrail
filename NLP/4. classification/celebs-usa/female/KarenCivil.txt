#LiveCivilBrunch https://t.co/GYTMw9Wy59
@karlihenriquez Any place that wants you to be good and not great is not a place to be..
Moving on‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so excited for the 8th Annual Live Civil Brunch in a few days. Eight exceptional years living in Los Angeles and connecting with so many incredible women.
When it comes to certain friendships, I‚Äôve always tried to find and see the good in them.. But I‚Äôve realized, I have to meet them where they are, and see them for exactly who they are.
Lastly, watch out for those ‚Äúso called‚Äù friends who will sell their relationship with you for a quick buck.. Will do anything to get ahead even if that means trying to diminish the brand you spent years building.
Then there are those disgruntled people who point blame on their lack success on everybody but themselves. Let your work/music speak for itself..
Never understood the ideology of ‚Äúyou never believed in me and I‚Äômma make it without you and show you‚Äù... I don‚Äôt need to stand next to you in order to share in your light. I applaud you regardless whether or not I helped you. What‚Äôs meant for you will always be for you.
This business has taught me to make sure I go where I‚Äôm celebrated not tolerated...
