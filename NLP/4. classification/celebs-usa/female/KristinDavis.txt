@AskTSA I've never experienced that horrible line at Bradley, new set up is BAD. Priority MUCH slower than economy. But ALL very slow
@flyLAXairport @AskTSA  Very major problem at Bradley! Never seen it like that.TSA were so rude to everyone who was panicking.Very stressful
@airfrance I'm on my flight now thank u.Norwegian came thru to get ppl for their flight. Took them to the front of the line. Just FYI
@AskTSA Everyone including the supervisor was very rude to all of us who needed help. Made matters much worse!
@RebeccaOnFOX7 @flyLAXairport @AskTSA  I know! And I fly a lot! Good luck
