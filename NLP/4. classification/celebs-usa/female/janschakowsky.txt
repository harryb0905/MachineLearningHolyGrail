Building a wasteful and useless wall on the backs of tax-paying Americans is not leadership. Why is he letting the American people suffer? I know why! Because, he doesn‚Äôt care. #TrumpShutdown
The real threat to our democracy is sitting in the Oval Office, not residing on the Southern border. The very idea this coward could use executive power to build a wall holds no credibility.
Every day @realDonaldTrump keeps the government closed, America‚Äôs small businesses pay the price. Due to the shutdown, the Small Business Administration has had to forgo hundreds of millions of dollars in loans &amp; contracting opportunities. #EndTheShutdown

President Trump is clearly terrified of what Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation will find. The President needs to know that @HouseDemocrats will do whatever it takes to find out the truth. The American public deserves no less.

Just THIRTY years ago, the Women‚Äôs Business Ownership Act eliminated laws requiring women to have a male relative or husband cosign loans. Now, 4 out of 10 businesses are owned by women #WomenInBiz

President Trump thinks he can end birthright citizenship unilaterally. He needs to check the Constitution and think again.  I always keep a pocket Constitution handy, and @realDonaldTrump would do well to do so too. https://t.co/6FegmFwb6T
I‚Äôve lost track of how many in Trump‚Äôs #CabinetOfCorruption are or have been under investigation ‚Äì let‚Äôs hope our justice system won‚Äôt.   The #ForThePeople agenda includes cleaning up corruption to make Washington work for YOU. It can‚Äôt come soon enough https://t.co/rwpPxW7L3g
President Trump can‚Äôt change the Constitution unilaterally ‚Äì we live in a democracy whether he likes it or not.   What he is really doing is trying to stoke fear and anger by scapegoating immigrants a week before an election.   https://t.co/7OwMDJGRHl

Today I stood with Cook County legislators, advocates, and administrators to denounce the President‚Äôs cruel proposal to upend the ‚ÄúPublic Charge‚Äù rule.   We also encouraged everyone to tell the Administration they oppose this change at: https://t.co/RVp2DmSYP0 https://t.co/S0Xm8R8vvE
Gun violence and anti-Semitism tore through a place of worship today and shook a nation. Both must be addressed with meaningful action. As we mourn and rebuild, we must work to ensure that mass shootings and violent acts of hatred become a thing of the past in America.
As a Jewish woman, as an American, and as a peace-loving human being, I am horrified by the terrorist attack that took place at a synagogue during Shabbat services today. I join the entire nation in mourning with the Tree of Life congregation and the city of Pittsburgh.
I would like to take a moment to say thank you to @APWU @rurallettercarriers @NALC_National et. al. for their vigilance in what must be a very challenging time. This is a reminder that public sector workers often risk their lives for the communities we all live in.
This report demonstrates how, yet again, Republicans are benefitting corporations and billionaires and leaving every day Americans to pick up their tab. Meanwhile, Democrats are fighting #ForThePeople   https://t.co/RNO5MzXjjC

We should not tolerate this anti-Democratic behavior in an ally of the United States.
By supporting Honduran President Hern√°ndez while barely questioning the apparent human rights violations @SenMarkey and I outlined in our letter, President Trump has some responsibility in creating this the circumstances that lead immigrants and refugees to flee towards the U.S. https://t.co/nrDvTgygDl
Ending that behavior is a necessary first step to restoring an atmosphere in which political and policy differences can be voiced without running the risk of violence.
While we do not know who is behind the current terrorist actions, hateful language, name-calling and rhetorical targeting of the media and public officials help raise tensions, tempers and divisions.    https://t.co/Yxm2tvZMqA
No one should live in terror because of their willingness to contribute to the public debate or perform public service.
I am grateful to the brave law enforcement authorities who protected the lives of individuals targeted by bombs sent to their homes. I hope the individuals responsible for targeting news bureaus, private citizens and elected officials are caught immediately and held accountable.

La caravana de migrantes que se dirige hacia nuestra frontera es el resultado directo del r√©gimen antidemocr√°tico de Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez. Debemos apoyar a estos refugiados y dejar de hacernos de la vista gorda a la represi√≥n y violencia de Hern√°ndez. https://t.co/SqmZ8bBl8S

The migrant caravan struggling toward our border is a direct result of Juan Orlando Hernandez‚Äôs anti-democratic regime. We must support these refugees and stop turning a blind eye to Hernandez‚Äôs repression and violence. https://t.co/Ionxukq8wX
Instead of admitting some responsibility in creating the violent situation in Honduras, President Trump is scapegoating immigrants and refugees. He is painting a picture of this caravan as a threat to our national security instead of the desperate group of refugees that they are. https://t.co/3XlVmPN7Nt

In September, @repmarkpocan, @RepRaulGrijalva and I led a similar letter to the CEO of @Walmart asking why so much of their tax savings went to stock buybacks while so little went to their workers.   Read more from @4TaxFairness about stock buybacks: https://t.co/BYAMq3jgjo https://t.co/e9cPnEmZB1

It is unconscionable that these corporations are using their multi-billion-dollar tax savings to benefit wealthy stockholders instead of to make their drugs affordable. We need answers about why the taxpayer dollars they receive don‚Äôt benefit taxpayers ‚Äì and we need them now.
That‚Äôs why today 15 of my colleagues and I sent letters to the CEOs of 5 @PhRMA corporations that benefit from corporate tax breaks and publicly-funded research, demanding answers to the problem of soaring prescription drug prices.  https://t.co/j0lzJ872kL
A life-saving drug is 100% ineffective when it is unaffordable. Drug companies are making record profits and receiving government benefits left and right while everyday Americans have to decide between paying rent and buying the medicines their family members need to survive.
‚ÄúChauvinist President acts like a chauvinist‚Äù is an evergreen headline.   ‚ÄúRepublican leaders are complacent and silent in the face of Trump‚Äôs misogyny‚Äù is an evergreen subheading.  https://t.co/IeSQZZ0aYQ
Meet Mary Mahew, the President‚Äôs disastrous pick to run #Medicaid. She has dedicated her career to dismantling Maine‚Äôs social safety net and opposing Medicaid expansion.   Republicans are waging their war on Medicaid from the inside.   https://t.co/XgHTgfAyPx

I support the Administration‚Äôs proposed rule today to require pharmaceutical corporations to disclose the list price of drugs in direct-to-consumer ads and call upon them to back even more fundamental steps that are necessary to lower the unaffordable drug costs Americans face. https://t.co/qytIIWai5d
I joined @SenatorDurbin in sponsoring the Drug-Price Transparency in Communications Act, which includes a provision that would require drug price disclosure in ads, much like the proposal Secretary Azar outlined today. https://t.co/te9u5bZwma

While Republicans have been busy cooking new ways to take away your earned benefits, Democrats are coming up with plans #ForThePeople. We will lower health care and prescription drug costs, raise wages, and clean up corruption in Washington.
The Seniors Task Force, which I co-chair with Rep. @DorisMatsui, recently released a report detailing the never-ending Republican attacks on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Read it here:   https://t.co/LVhIMHx1OA
According to the @WashingtonPost, in President Trump‚Äôs USA Today op-ed ‚Äúalmost every sentence contained a misleading statement or falsehood.‚Äù On top of that, it LAUGHABLY tries to paint the GOP as defenders of seniors and their earned benefits. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì we kept the receipts.
I stood with @SenDurbin and my friends at @SCN_Network today to protest President Trump‚Äôs inhumane decision to close America‚Äôs doors by reducing our refugee admissions level to a mere 30,000. #RefugeesWelcome https://t.co/Rr29YQyv8Y
Stop and frisk is not ‚Äúsmart on crime‚Äù --it is discriminatory and dehumanizing. Study after study, done in Chicago and elsewhere, show that these policies disproportionately affect communities of color and do not reduce crime.   https://t.co/cHs9e4xCMr
This day will live in infamy. Every Supreme Court decision Brett #Kavanaugh makes will be tainted with the indelible stain of the accusations against him and the tarnished process that confirmed him.

My friend Senator @PattyMurray has already introduced the same bill in the Senate.   Read more about it here: https://t.co/a2bNb2vxCg
That's why today, @DonaldNorcross, @RepBonamici and I introduced the Women's Pension Protection Act. The bill improves spousal access to retirement plans, makes more long-term and part-time workers eligible for retirement plans, and improves financial literacy.
As we work to win full equality for women in America, we cannot overlook the retirement gap. Because they are much more likely to earn less than their male counterparts, women in America typically have far less money saved up for retirement.
This homophobic and retrograde action has no place in our country.   It‚Äôs no wonder the United Nations openly laughs at our President. What a disgrace.   https://t.co/JhdHQER7lc

Mr. Wright DOES have experience in the field ‚Äì years of working for @DOWChemical to put corporate profits over public health.
President Trump‚Äôs 1st nominee to lead the @EPA Superfund cleanup was a disgraced banker, barred for life from the securities industry, with no experience in the environmental field. Now that he has resigned in disgrace, President Trump has nominated Peter Wright for the job.

Prescription drug companies will continue to raise the prices of prescription drugs for one simple reason: because they can. We need bold, decisive actions that get to the root causes of the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs, and the HHS Blueprint simply doesn‚Äôt deliver.
Today I led some of my Democratic colleagues in formally commenting on President Trump's drug pricing blueprint. While I am glad that the Trump Admin. has decided to address the drug price crisis, their blueprint for action falls far short of what is required to lower prices.
The President of the United States today publicly denigrated the U.S. intelligence community while praising one of the most adversarial foreign leaders in the world. This goes beyond incompetence and it borders on treason.  Full statement: https://t.co/Eu1CkLBCpv https://t.co/SphtzyehXh

U.S. prisons use more care when recording personal items like wallets and watches while taking people into custody than U.S. border agents use to record refugee children when they snatch them away from their refugee parents. This is monstrous.  https://t.co/XnKElvFQ0c

With #JANUS, @GovRauner targeted @afscme31 because they always stand up for working families and collective bargaining.   This #SCOTUS decision won't change that. @afscme31 won't be stopped. We will fight harder than ever.   #UNION #UnionStrong https://t.co/TE23obfLXE
Unions gave us pensions, the weekend, child labor laws, &amp; many other protections we take for granted today. Unions built the American middle class.

It‚Äôs a shame the Court has chosen to side with billionaires and corporations over teachers, firefighters, social workers, and emergency medical technicians.  #Janus #Union  https://t.co/4g7LZ3XT61
#Janus is part of an aggressive, well-funded attack on federal, state and local, and private sector workers.
Janus is about making it more difficult for state and local workers to join together in unions, to bargain collectively for fair wages and benefits, to promote safe workplaces, to blow the whistle on fraud and abuse, and to stand up for the people they serve. https://t.co/jd5hsJRAjQ
This is a sad day for public employees and all of us who rely on them to provide us with the services we need, from keeping our air and water clean to teaching our children to protecting public health.  #Janus #Union  https://t.co/3wdK4MUBJ2

For Erin, Taylor, Megan, William, and more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, we must keep fighting to #ProtectOurCare. 7/7
William is a former photographer who lost his eyesight (and thus his job and insurance) due to a massive stroke. Thanks to the #ACA, he was able to find an affordable and robust insurance plan, which would be impossible if President Trump and AG Sessions get their way.  6/7
Megan had a hard time finding insurance to cover pregnancy and childbirth. She found it thanks to the #ACA and had a happy, healthy baby. She‚Äôs at risk of losing her care if the Trump administration takes us back to the days when being a woman was a pre-existing condition.  5/7
Taylor is HIV positive. He wrote me the last time the GOP tried to repeal the #ACA to tell me about the rough road he faced until he was able to receive care at @howardbrownhc thanks to the Affordable Care Act. We can‚Äôt leave Taylor out in the cold. We must #ProtectOurCare 4/7
Erin is a type 1 diabetic. For years, she had been denied coverage because of this pre-existing condition. Thanks to the #ACA today no one can refuse to insure her and companies can no longer charge her higher premiums for her other ‚Äúpre-existing condition‚Äù -- being a woman.  3/7
The Trump Administration is refusing to defend the #ACA in court, meaning that more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care. Here are some of the stories that constituents have sent me over the years: 2/7
It‚Äôs hard to stay focused with so much going on, but we can‚Äôt lose our focus now. We can‚Äôt stop fighting to #ProtectOurCare. 1/7
And when that child asks why, I wish my colleagues would tell them the truth: that Republicans gave a massive, $2 trillion tax gift to billionaires and now the rest of the country is paying for it.  #GOPTaxScam
I wish that my Republican colleagues would have to look one of these hungry kids in the eye and tell them that they won‚Äôt get the meals they‚Äôre used to receiving at school ‚Äì often the only nutritious meal they‚Äôll have all day.
How cruel do my Republican colleagues have to be to rip food out of the mouths of hungry children?
THREAD: If the Senate allows this bill to become law, 2 million Americans ‚Äì that‚Äôs about 400,000 families ‚Äì would lose nutrition assistance and 265,000 children would lose the school meals they depend on. (#SNAP)  https://t.co/iVIcRSljsN

The #GOPBudget proposes taking $537 billion from Medicare over the next 10 yrs by, among other things, raising the age of eligibility.   This cannot stand. Medicare is a benefit that Americans have EARNED. I opposed these cuts during our debate in the Budget Committee today. https://t.co/J55kHx8uRW
Republicans are waging war on anti-poverty and anti-hunger programs.   TODAY in the House, they are trying to pass a #GOPbudget with $923 billion in cuts to anti-poverty programs and a Farm Bill that cuts #SNAP by $23 billion.
House Republicans crafted the #GOPBudget ‚Äì a statement of their misplaced values. They propose ripping health care away from millions; crippling Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; and slashing funding for education, infrastructure, anti-hunger &amp; anti-poverty programs. https://t.co/hGRlOWXyvN

As students across the country march for their lives to demand action on gun violence, Republicans in Congress have dug in their heels and done nothing to protect them.
Unions gave us pensions, the weekend, child labor laws, &amp; many other protections we take for granted today. Unions built the American middle class. If we want good jobs, good wages, &amp; good benefits for American workers, we must defend the right to join a #UNION. #WeRise #NormaRae https://t.co/8WoGuFgbLw
In 2017, nearly 41 million people relied on SNAP to get access to nutritious food. The average SNAP recipient receives $126 a month, which is about $1.40 per meal. We should be finding ways to strengthen hunger prevention programs in America, not ripping them apart. #ProtectSNAP
Did my Republican colleagues really come to Congress to take food out of the mouths of hungry children?  #ProtectSNAP   https://t.co/020awzKokx
This GOP #FarmBill bill is a blatant, senseless attack on millions of American families. Republicans are attempting to cut $23 billion from SNAP‚Äì the country‚Äôs most effective program in fighting hunger and tackling poverty.   We must #ProtectSNAP
This is not who we are as a country. We are a nation built by immigrants for immigrants, and we cannot allow President Trump to change that. https://t.co/R5UzFTovvU
While President Trump was busy calling undocumented immigrants ‚Äúanimals‚Äù, his Administration was grappling with the question of what to do with the migrant children they plan to rip away from their parents.   Their answer? Throw them into military bases.  https://t.co/DTJ2lPPZHS

The Department of Homeland Security under President Trump has already ripped TPS protections away from nearly 200,000 Salvadorans, 50,000 Haitians, and 9,000 Nepalis ‚Äì not to mention its cruel decision to throw the lives of 1.8 million Dreamers into limbo. https://t.co/VRMG5SZoPw

Today, the Health Subcommittee considered 64 bills to deal with the opioid epidemic. Not only did none of the bills deal with drug prices ‚Äì Republicans refused to consider to two amendments I offered to make up for that failure.
As with many other life-saving drugs, the costs of naloxone, which has been on the market since 1971, are exorbitant and growing dramatically as the need increases and pharmaceutical corporations see an opportunity to profit.
In communities affected by the #opioidcrisis, emergency medical personnel, first responders and even the public are being encouraged to stock naloxone ‚Äì an opioid overdose reversal drug that can literally mean the difference between life and death for patients. https://t.co/PHaEYUIcb3

My full statement on today's omnibus: https://t.co/hvRk3LoIMJ
I will continue to resist Republicans‚Äô wrongheaded priorities. Americans demand better health care, safer communities, and a long-term solution for Dreamers. Once again, Republicans in Congress failed to deliver.
I applaud Leader @NancyPelosi, Ranking Member @NitaLowey , and the Democratic members of the Appropriations Committee for delivering real victories for the American people. However, I could not in good conscience vote in favor of a spending bill that leaves many Americans behind.
The omnibus bill passed by the House earlier today includes many hard-won Democratic priorities, but it leaves major issues unresolved.

I thank @louiseslaughter for all she did in her life. The women of America, myself very much included, are much better off for it.
.@louiseslaughter embodied what is best in public service. She was kind, passionate, effective, and humble. As heartbroken as I am today, I know that the best way to honor Louise is to continue to work for the causes she believed in.
I am incredibly saddened to hear about the passing of @louiseslaughter ‚Äì a dear friend, exemplary public servant, inspiring leader, and champion for women‚Äôs rights. My thoughts today are with Louise‚Äôs three daughters, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchild.

If Mr. Pompeo is confirmed and he decides to use his term as Secretary of State to enable Mr. Trump‚Äôs worst impulses, the world will be much worse off for it.  https://t.co/xXEL8iWlYm
The most important question surrounding Mr. Pompeo‚Äôs appointment is this: will he even try to rein in President Trump‚Äôs shoot-from-the-hip style and give some coherence to our out-of-control foreign policy?
My full statement on President Trump's State Department "Shakeup":  https://t.co/e4RFxfR1X4
Firing the Secretary of State with a tweet and without giving him so much as a heads up, let alone an explanation, projects an image of chaos and disarray to America‚Äôs allies and enemies abroad.  https://t.co/zirsTgqZFE
Since his Presidency began, Donald Trump has been running his cabinet like a temp agency.
Ahead of the #NationalSchoolWalkout on Wednesday, I met with Senn HS student leaders who marched to my office on Feb. 28 to demand action on #GunSafety. I thanked them for their activism, and we discussed how to get legislation like an assault weapons ban passed. https://t.co/Gnl5I3I1EF

The Trump #InfrastructureScam requires cash-strapped local and state governments to fund projects, meaning the costs would end up being passed along to YOU.
The Trump Infrastructure Plan is an unprecedented privatization scheme which will prevent real investment in our Nation's dated infrastructure.
President Trump‚Äôs infrastructure proposal would gut bedrock environmental, clean water, and clean air protections under the guise of speeding up projects. #InfrastructureScam
FACT: the #TrumpBudget‚Äôs cuts to transportation spending are larger than the entire Trump infrastructure package. #InfrastructureScam https://t.co/n8wT12oVC9

Today, we who believe in the inherent dignity and worth of women everywhere take time to celebrate our victories and set our goals for the year to come. Tomorrow, we continue our fight. We #PressForProgess.  #IWD2018
The theme for this year‚Äôs #InternationalWomensDay is #PressForProgress. This theme is a call to action ‚Äì a reminder that we cannot let up on our campaign to achieve full and true equality.
Although many in the United States today have well-founded fears about the rolling back of women‚Äôs rights, I believe that we don‚Äôt have to wait another minute to advocate for policies that enshrine the equality &amp; dignity of women.  https://t.co/qwQbTfdrAt
However, we have seen inspiring example after example of women acting as the most effective advocates for peace. That knowledge was the guiding principle behind the #WomenPeaceandSecurity Act, a bipartisan bill that I wrote, sponsored, &amp; enacted last year. https://t.co/5gG1UXS5Pw
Another massive challenge facing women around the world is the unparalleled refugee crisis that rages on in virtually every corner of the world. Like most crises, the mass displacement brought on by conflict and strife is uniquely &amp; disproportionately affecting women &amp; girls.
Low-income women, women of color, and undocumented migrants are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, especially in the workplace.
High profile cases drove the conversation and encouraged victims and survivors to come out of the shadows. Now we must harness the incredible energy of those movements and make sure that we protect all women from this scourge.
This year, women made their voices heard when they spoke out against sexual abuse, harassment, and all forms of sexual violence in what came to be known as the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements
Today, following a particularly tumultuous year for women, we have many achievements to celebrate and a lot of work ahead of us.
Every year on #InternationalWomensDay, we pause to take stock of the work we‚Äôve done to improve life for women and girls around the world and to recommit ourselves to conquering the many obstacles that are left.
I just published ‚ÄúThis International Women‚Äôs Day, we must #PressForProgress‚Äù https://t.co/YohgYgGHW4
There should be no place in our society for those words. My full statement is below: https://t.co/OjXZFm8brI
I am appalled by the statements of Louis Farrakhan and condemn him for once again fanning the flames of anti-Semitism.  At a time where the Anti-Defamation League tells us that anti-Semitic incidents rose by 57% last year, those remarks are particularly dangerous.

These reports raise real concerns that the VA privatization effort is part of a broader effort to undermine Americans‚Äô earned benefits, one that puts the interests of wealthy corporate donors ahead of the needs of veterans.  https://t.co/HikWEMWqSo
The health and well-being of those who put their lives on the line for our country should be our top priority, which is why I oppose privatization of #Veterans Administration health services.

According to the Economic Policy Institute, black women will bear the biggest burden if #JanusvAFSCME is ruled against unions and working people.   https://t.co/2MtCLfZz4i

The #JanusvAFSCME case represents an attack on working Americans. Working women and men deserve the freedom to unite to protect their rights and improve their families‚Äô well-being.

The Trump Shutdown may be over. But for pensioners, veterans, victims of the opioid epidemic, families needing Community Health Centers, American citizens ravaged by natural disasters, and 800,000 Dreamers, it still feels like the Republican-controlled government is closed.
Since the fiscal year began almost 4 months ago, Republicans have kept our government running through a patchwork of one short-term funding bill after another. Almost 4 months later, we have no long-term agreement on a budget &amp; no action on our nation‚Äôs most critical priorities.
Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House, and are still somehow incapable of governing. I refuse to enable their recklessness. I will vote NO on their funding bill.
A woman‚Äôs ability to control her own body is the foundation of all other rights. Without that, women can never truly be free. #RoevWade #7in10forRoe #roe45 #RiseUp4Roe https://t.co/1fe0bmH9R6
What we need now is the willingness from President Trump and Republican leadership to put the priorities of the American people above their partisan objectives. Let‚Äôs get to work.
If proposals like a reauthorization of Community Health Centers, the Butch Lewis Act to protect pensions, the Dream Act, or disaster relief funds were to come to the House floor, I‚Äôm sure they would pass.
Democrats are ready and willing to work on bipartisan solutions to end the Trump shutdown. I firmly believe that our priorities have bipartisan support.
We‚Äôre here because Republicans spent months working to pass a tax scam that gave 83% of its benefits to the wealthiest 1% in our country and neglected their responsibility to keep our government funded.
Here we are on the third day of the #TrumpShutdown. The first time in American history when our government has shut down while one party has control of the House, Senate, and White House.
We need a #DreamActNow https://t.co/qgPTm6jp3F

Republicans just can‚Äôt govern. They wanted a budget that slashed spending on crucial domestic programs, so they took hostages: our children‚Äôs health care, the fate of Dreamers, hard-earned pensions, and disaster-relief funds. The result? A #TrumpShutdown

This morning, as Republicans bring us closer and closer to a #GOPShutdown, they‚Äôre using precious time on the House floor to attempt to erode women‚Äôs rights to obtain safe, legal abortions.  #PatientsOverPolitics https://t.co/r3EYooz2KZ
Of course¬∏ if a baby is born you do everything you can to keep that child alive. That‚Äôs the law. No one opposes that. But Republicans are pushing a bill that  would insert the opinions of politicians into medical practice‚Äìresulting in great harm to the health of women and babies.
Today on the House floor I honored the life and legacy of my great friend and mentor, progressive hero Paul Booth. https://t.co/nWlK2f87pC
The GOP bill fails to provide a solution for the 800,000 Dreamers whose lives were thrown into chaos when @POTUS ended  DACA. It ignores Americans whose lives were upturned by natural disasters by failing to provide emergency disaster funding for TX, FL, CA, PR or the USVI.
Republicans brag that this bill finally offers a long-term reauthorization of CHIP, which expired in September, but fail to mention that their bill doesn‚Äôt pay for the clinics that care for our nation‚Äôs children. The Republican bill completely neglects our health care system.
I'll be voting against the GOP bill to barely keep our government funded for another month. I refuse to enable Republicans, who have full control of our federal government, to keep funding our govt a month at a time, without addressing the most pressing crises facing our country.
Yet another ‚Äúuninformed‚Äù tweet from the President of the United States. It‚Äôs never the wrong time to protect children‚Äôs health. That‚Äôs why we need health centers open too. https://t.co/BLGaVovHLF

In a time when hate crimes are on the rise, divisions are starker than ever, and racism runs rampant at the highest levels of our government, let us recommit ourselves to always standing up for what is right and what is good.
Dr. King presented us with the vision of a world where justice and love triumph over bigotry and hate.  He took action to make our society better.  He made us understand that each one of us has the power to speak out, to act and to change the world. #MLKDay
If we heed the teaching of Dr. King, we will turn our outrage into action, our meetings into movements, our chants into laws, and our ideals into societal norms.  Today and every day, let us honor Dr. King through our actions. #MLKDay

While crafting the #GOPTaxScam, Republicans ignored the interest of the American people, the counsel of experts, and plain common sense. Instead, they listened only to the siren song of their corporate special interest donors.
With loud cheers and smug smiles on their faces, Republicans in the House just passed one of the most disastrous bills that I have seen come before Congress since I arrived here. And that‚Äôs saying something #GOPTaxScam

I continue to believe that the only path to sustainable peace is a two-state solution that allows Israelis and Palestinians to live side-by-side with economic prosperity and security. President Trump‚Äôs action has made that much more difficult to achieve.
There is reason that virtually all of our allies have urged us not to take this step.
Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, but taking this step outside of the framework of a final status agreement derails the peace process, jeopardizes our ability to help broker an agreement, and creates the likelihood of more violence in the region.
President Trump‚Äôs announcement today ignores reality and the consequences of an action that breaks with long-time U.S. policy held by both Republican and Democratic Administrations.  https://t.co/5C3E6S5Thx

In October, @RepRaulGrijalva, @repmarkpocan and telling POTUS that nominating Alex Azar to HHS Sec. is putting the #pharma fox in charge of the health care henhouse.
Instead of taking meaningful action to bring prescription drug costs down as he has promised, President Trump has now nominated a price-gouging #pharma executive to lead our country‚Äôs top public health agency  https://t.co/DsVFt31mVl

The #GOPTaxbill rewards corporations that send their jobs and profits overseas. My #PatriotEmployer Act rewards businesses that invest in American jobs and American workers. Let's get our priorities straight.
Here's the truth about the Republican Tax Scam: it's nothing more than a massive giveaway to large corporations and the ultra-wealthy. https://t.co/k382cBDctZ
#Dreamers are America's children, plain and simple. We won't stop fighting for them.

The #GOPTaxPlan would be a disaster for the middle class, raising taxes on millions of families across the country.
The GOP says their tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy will ‚Äòtrickle-down‚Äô and help everyone else. With corporate profits booming, shouldn‚Äôt the trickle have started already?
#GOPTaxPlan in a nutshell:   -Raise taxes on the middle class -Reward corporations sending jobs overseas -Steal from Medicare and Medicaid  -All to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy
The @HouseGOP tax scam would mean massive tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, and tax breaks for multinational corporations that outsource the jobs of American workers.
The @GOPtaxbill will increase costs for middle-class families, seniors, and people with disabilities. It‚Äôs dishonest, unfair, and dangerous to our country‚Äôs future.
Why I oppose today's partisan GOP bill on CHIP: https://t.co/jyRWtt8zSm
Leave it to the @HouseGOP to threaten something as crucial as health care for kids by tying it to their destructive partisan objectives.
Republicans are forcing us to vote on an unfair, partisan bill that proposes paying for the Children's Health Insurance Program by completely assaulting other areas of our health care system.

#ThursdayThoughts https://t.co/vYyzt8PKeE
Shame on my Republican colleagues for voting 'yes' on a #budget that proposes giving billionaires a tax cut and taking health care away from millions. https://t.co/T29W8rs76q
So I ask my colleagues: Did you really come to Congress to take away health care and reduce incomes for middle-class families? If you care about anyone other than millionaires and billionaires, vote NO!
Under the Republican tax plan, 1.9 million Illinoisans would no longer be able to claim the state and local tax deduction. Nationwide, 30% of middle-class households making between $50,000 and $150,000 would pay MORE in taxes!
This #BillionairesBudget would slash Medicaid by $1 trillion ‚Äì threatening health care for 1 in 4 Americans. It would slash seniors‚Äô Medicare by $470 billion. And this budget proposes yet again to repeal the #ACA
The Republican Budget paves the way for trillions of dollars in tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and corporations. All paid for by middle-class families, children, seniors, and people w/ disabilities. https://t.co/EeIpFAqkqh

Congress has a chance to rectify President Trump's Iran deal blunder. Shame on anyone who chooses to play Yes Man to President Trump over avoiding a nuclear armed Iran and the potential for destruction it could bring.
President Trump‚Äôs modus operandi is chaos and recklessness. He is not fit to lead, and he continues to treat matters of global security as if they were one more episode of ‚ÄòThe Apprentice.‚Äô
My full statement on President Trump's Iran blunder: https://t.co/DiyRY2AhCy
President Trump‚Äôs decision to decertify the Iran Deal, based on nothing but ego and a brutish determination to destroy anything linked to President Obama‚Äôs legacy, has put the world in danger.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says that this move will increase premiums for ALL people buying #ACA plans by an average 20 percent next year.   https://t.co/jjAbGRURYW
Today, after dropping a bombshell on millions of health care consumers, President Trump is probably jetting off to one of his properties to play a few rounds of golf.
Republicans in the White House and Congress are engaged in a massive #ACA sabotage effort that will drive up your family‚Äôs costs. If you see higher premiums next year, remember that they will include a ‚ÄúRepublican surcharge‚Äù that could have been easily prevented.
Unregulated out-of-state plans are not an answer to making health care more secure or more affordable ‚Äì they are a sorry and cruel attempt to look like the Trump Administration is doing something about health care.
Today‚Äôs executive order is the latest effort by the Trump Administration to sabotage the #ACA ‚Äì driving up premiums, eroding consumer protections, and destabilizing the market.
Sexual assault on campus is a scourge that needs to end ‚Äì rolling back protections is a sharp betrayal of America‚Äôs students. We're standing with them today. https://t.co/xOiaLsh5Tr

We cannot continue to make excuses. Federal comprehensive gun safety legislation must be a national priority.
As a country, we cannot accept this as the new normal. Gun violence is a scourge and an epidemic, and it requires bold legislative action.
Back home in Chicago, our city has seen close to 500 people murdered by guns so far in 2017.
Only a year and a few months after the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando, our country has a harrowing new record for the worst mass shooting in our history.

Watching President Trump‚Äôs racist, rambling press conference today was surreal and stunning.
Instead, we should work for comprehensive immigration reform that strengthens our nation
I am as committed as ever to defending #DREAMers &amp; the #DACA program. The campaign to dismantle it is senseless &amp; anti-immigrant. #DACAWorks
The #DACA program has unequivocally demonstrated that America‚Äôs strength is in our diversity.
For five years, young #DREAMers have demonstrated the promise and potential of our nation‚Äôs immigrants.
Today is the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the #DACA program.
For 82 years, Social Security has provided older Americans with stability and security. We must protect it. #SocSec82
US could afford to create Social Security during the Great Depression, we can afford to protect and expand it now. #SocSec82
Today we celebrate the 82nd year of seniors living with peace of mind after retirement, thanks to Social Security. #SocSec82
Thank you @RepRobinKelly for putting on a wonderful panel today to propose and discuss #SolutionsOnly on #HealthCare https://t.co/6muT2dJcdQ
I am praying for peace.
As we wait for more details regarding the peaceful protesters attacked by a vehicle, my thoughts are with the victims &amp; their loved ones
especially coming from a President who uses social media to criticize, badmouth, and insult anything that doesn't please him.
Passing blame and failing to denounce white supremacy outright is abhorrent --
In difficult times, our country needs a leader who brings us together.
The hatred, bigotry, and violence displayed by white supremacists  in Charlottesville today is shocking and unacceptable.

If only Republicans abandon their cruel attacks on Americans‚Äô health care and work with Democrats on real solutions
We can provide #ABetterDeal for health care consumers, businesses and providers
Dems have put out many ideas to do so‚Äì from creating a public option to giving Medicare power to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs
Republicans must come to the table to work with Democrats to stabilize the market and lower the cost of health care
Now it is time for Congressional Republicans to join Democrats to prevent President Trump‚Äôs sabotage strategy  https://t.co/tOOHeMEXQi

The fact that this bill will get ANY votes is sickening. Senators who vote ‚Äòyes‚Äô are actively betraying their constituents, plain and simple
Under this bill, 32 million would lose their health care and premiums would double in ten years.

Obamacare expanded health care coverage. Every version of Trumpcare that we've seen would rip coverage away ‚Äì by the millions

The #GOPbudget cuts taxes for the wealthy &amp; ravages health care and job training for everyone else. Unacceptable.
.@HousebudgetGOP just voted against my amendment to fund @PPFA and defeated it ‚Äì women won‚Äôt forget.
This war against @PPFA  is nothing more than a directüëèüèΩattacküëèüèΩ on women's health
I #StandWithPP because over half of their centers are in medically underserved areas‚Äì if defunded, 15% of ppl in those areas would lose care
I #StandWithPP because one in five women in our country will visit a Planned Parenthood in her lifetime
I‚Äôm about to offer an amendment to the #GOPBudget that would defend @PPFA‚Äôs funding ‚Äì 2.5 million Americans depend on it every year.
The #GOPbudget is even meaner than their healthcare bill. @POTUS &amp; his Republican allies are hanging hard-working Americans out to dry.

I am truly sickened, and I will not stop fighting against this monstrosity of a bill.
Under the Republican bill, the average millionaire would get a tax cut of close to $50,000 a year.
All of this so that Republicans in Congress can give an enormous tax cut to their ultra-wealthy cronies.
and YES‚Äìit would mean people in the richest country in the world at the richest point in its history, dying bc they can't afford health care
it would mean children, mothers, seniors, and others on #Medicaid having their health care ripped away
it would mean people with pre-existing conditions struggling to find a plan to cover them
it would mean enormous job loss
it would mean more expensive plans with far worse coverage
it would mean Americans over the age of fifty losing health insurance because they can‚Äôt make their skyrocketing payments
it would mean hospitals and nursing homes closing
The Republican bill would result in 22 million people losing their health insurance

Listen to the experts: #Trumpcare would be disastrous for Illinois  https://t.co/E7HWxjAknP
The #resistance to the Trump/Ryan agenda is stronger than ever, and I know whose side I‚Äôm on.
The groundswell of opposition that we have seen from around the country is astounding, and it won‚Äôt end here.
Believe me: the American people will remember. https://t.co/AKc8uIUepm
I just voted "HELL NO" on #Trumpcare.
House and Senate Dems stand united against #Trumpcare today https://t.co/4prVrMBDDL
#Trumpcare by the numbers https://t.co/S6sxYWWV1V
This bill is a disaster and anyone who votes for it does so at their extreme peril.
The Republican attempt to improve #Trumpcare is like trying to put out a dumpster fire with gasoline.
17% ‚Äì the percentage of Americans who support this bill ‚ÄìBEFORE the GOP made it worse
758% ‚Äì the premium increase a 64 year old making $26,000 a year will pay because of the Republican age tax.
$600 billion ‚Äì the tax cuts that millionaires, billionaires and corporations get.
$880 billion ‚Äìthe size of the cut to Medicaid, threatening health and long-term care for 74 million people
24 million ‚Äì the number of children, adults and veterans whose health insurance will be ripped away.
Here are 5 numbers that show just how terrible this Republican bill is:
I'll be speaking on the House floor very voice my strong opposition to #Trumpcare very soon.   Watch live: https://t.co/W8gWRdjfLr
#VoteNO   https://t.co/NVR9F2jHfx
Calls from my constituents THIS WEEK:   Support #Trumpcare: 1 Oppose #Trumpcare: 554  Thank you for your calls! Believe me, I‚Äôm listening.

.@HouseGOP are bringing #AHCA to a vote tomorrow at their own peril and against the will of the American people. SAD! BAD!
In the same week that we introduced the #EqualityAct, @POTUS is considering signing a #LicenseToDiscriminate.
.@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs #LicenseToDiscriminate would allow taxpayer money to subsidize discrimination; completely against American values https://t.co/gxefznz9vZ
Much like CA, retirees in IL would be devastated if @POTUS signs the Wall St. handout passed by the Senate today  https://t.co/e0WtBwXDNE
The best way to protect people with preexisting conditions is to strengthen the #ACA and let #Trumpcare bite the dust
Their bill would spell absolute disaster for the 129 Million Americans who have preexisting conditions

Unlike the Trump Administration, this movement has been very effective.
in my district and across the country, Americans have been standing up and resisting the Trump agenda with unwavering passion #trump100days
President Trump has attempted to divide our country and turn groups of people against each other. Thankfully, they have not been effective.
They have been full of devastating policy shifts that will irreparably harm our environment and spell disaster for middle class Americans
#trump100days have been marked by attacks on immigrants, women, Muslims, and LGBTQ individuals.

On #YomHashoah we are also reminded that anti-Semitism still exists and threatens the people of Israel and Jews all over the world.

.@SpeakerRyan's #WrongWay poverty team has done everything it can to weaken the ladders of opportunity. https://t.co/cS47ESqk8g
.@SpeakerRyan's poverty legislation is the same backwards, trickle down way @HouseGOP has pushed for years. It's the #WrongWay for America.
FACT: @HouseGOP has chosen to worsen the impact of poverty, weaken the ladders of opportunity &amp; demonize hungry families. #WrongWay

2 GOP witnesses at E&amp;C hearing on Part B Demo have pages of identical testimony ‚Äì making it clear that PhRMA is behind what they‚Äôre saying.
We can't continue on this path where drug costs rise faster than health costs and patients are bankrupted to pay for life-saving drugs.
Every time we attempt lower drug costs we are met with fierce opposition. We reform other parts of health care, but nothing on drug costs
I'm proud to stand with many organizations in supporting the CMS proposal. It will help lower drug costs. https://t.co/e6pRoyLDcg
We must lower prescription drug costs. This is why I support the actions taken by CMS. Live: https://t.co/v6YeZbPrkD https://t.co/txbhJvVAa5
