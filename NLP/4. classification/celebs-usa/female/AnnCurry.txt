The President can do it.  And as the #KavanaughConfirmation is heading to the full Senate, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has the power to call for an FBI investigation into the  accusations. https://t.co/7s2S5l6XxA
Appears it’s up to Senate Majority leader McConnell, who supports #Kavanaugh.   But he could ask for an FBI investigation if too many Senators are unwilling to confirm without one.  Senators Collins, Murkowski and Flake are key. https://t.co/GySB9KYOOg
Your confusion is understandable.  Yes there was a vote.  The Senate Judiciary committee approved Kavanaugh’s nomination with Senator Flake saying he would vote yes to pass it out of committee to the full Senate, but could vote  no there, unless the FBI investigates. #Kavanaugh https://t.co/7jcBR2ngKW
What’s next: now Kavanaugh’s nomination will go before the full Senate, with Senator Flake saying he could vote against Kavanaugh there, unless there is an FBI investigation.  Now Senate leaders will decide whether the FBI investigates. #KavanaughConfirmationHearing https://t.co/YZScdwyEw9
Now: Republican Senator Flake favors having the FBI investigate, saying it would be good for the country which is being “pulled apart” by the #KavanaughConfirmation hearings.

You are making total sense.  Opinion has a place in journalism, but it is fundamentally dishonest to allow people to think it is news.  It must be clearly marked.  And few reporters are expert enough to have an opinion that truly matters. https://t.co/vjJO0WsaXp

.@netanyahu (Israel's PM) tweets, "The deal is a historic mistake."
.@BarackObama, ahead of debate in Congress: “I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal."
.@HassanRouhani says Iran keeps more than 6,000 centrifuges+all economic sanctions "and even" arms and missile sanctions will be removed.
.@HassanRouhani "What was most significant," in the negotiations was the stability and patience and courage.. of the Iranian people."
.@HassanRouhani "We consistently stressed that the negotiations would not" have a winner and a loser, but be a "win-win."
.@HassanRouhani (Iranian President) "A new chapter has started..."
.@BarackObama "We do not have to accept an endless spiral into conflict..." "This deal offers an opportunity to move in a new direction."
.@BarackObama: "No deal means no lasting constraints on Iran's nuclear program. No deal means a greater chance of more war in the ME."

.@JZarif says 1 hurdle at #IranTalks is how to announce any deal:"My fear is a two page document is a paper tiger. Anybody can kill it."
@Zippertheslip Iran says it wants nuclear power, not a nuclear weapon. Problem is, you need the same basic ingredients for both.
@Bernhardtbeach World would reimposed crippling economic sanctions and be back on a war footing.
@arash_tehran Sure. He called for a robust agreement w/transparency, but unlike in the past, he did not indicate any issue to block it.

@Doylebytes what can you add?
@Doylebytes So politics lit the match.  But ethnic rivalries and religious differences are the tinder to this wildfire.
@Doylebytes There is a risk of sectarian revenge killings. These two groups also include tribes that have long struggled over resources.
@Doylebytes Now the interim President the Muslim rebels put in power is stepping down, in this Christian majority nation.
@Doylebytes both sides are now accused of crimes against humanity.
@Doylebytes These rebels targeted Christians, who are largely from other tribes, with horrific violence.  They formed militias.
@Doylebytes ok.Last march mostly Muslim rebels made up of a coalition of tribes staged a could and installed CAR's first Muslim President.

Are America's colleges, universities doing enough for veterans?  Why aren't more vets studying on the GI bill like the old days?

Is the US doing enough to get vets higher education, jobs, preferential mortgages, as after WWII, to lift our nation's economy?
How will we treat our Iraq war vets, who have the resilience, courage, leadership skills, to be our next greatest generation?
