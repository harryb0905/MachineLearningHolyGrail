@CJBLFN im passionate about this, haha
@CJBLFN but why is one plastic cup reusable and another isnt? They are all reusable, right? This world doesn't need any more plastic cups:)
@CJBLFN but they let u use one you buy from them, isn't that a health risk? It's not. They can wash it for you. It's a line of crap.
@LunaJade8 @Starbucks it's bullshit. there is no difference, this plastic "disposable" cup is my personal refillable cup!!
why will @Starbucks refill a 20$cup from them but not my just as reusable plastic venti cup? Just rinse+reuse it don't want2make more trash!
