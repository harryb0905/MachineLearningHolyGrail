A day later and I still don't understand: - how Bohemian Rhapsody got nominated for Best Picture (and I love Queen) OR - how Green Book won  and especially - how Beale Street wasn't even considered.
CAPITO: I’ll vote no on the motion to end the national emergency.   Why? She said (paraphrase) because she thinks the president has the right to protect the country, this is within his rights.
NOW: Senate vote on GOP bill about late term abortions.  House Republicans crosses the Rotunda to watch.  (Also poss album cover shot below btw. Cc: @GOPLeader ) https://t.co/MSFx41Lq5q
Rep. Castro: “This will take historic unity” for Congress to retake/assert its power and end this national emergency.   He’s right.  It ultimately will take a 2/3 vote to end the natl emergency.   At a time of modern peak partisanship.
NOW: Congress is back.  And @SpeakerPelosi is kicking off the week w/ Dems sharp opposition to the Natl Emergency.  News conf today. Vote in House tomorrow. https://t.co/H9bpGSNoJm
Congratulations to the great Olivia Colman.  But cannot believe Glenn Close.  Again.  Gahhhhhhhhhh.
@IAmAmnaNawaz @DaviSusan +1 to what amna said.
Every Oscar acceptance speech so far has been given by or led by a woman.    (Women have won all the solo awards and shared the team awards.) (No male acting awards have been given yet.)
LOVE Regina King winning, because Regina King.  But also, this now means the Miss Congeniality *franchise* has more Oscar-winning actors in it than any of the movies/franchises nominated for Best Picture the year it came out. (2000.)  (thank you to folks for the correx!)
@Lisa_from_SoCal Oh snap. I meant the franchise... gah. Thank you.
@contraryguy Is that a rhetorical question or would you like the rundown...?
Hmm, not my point.  I feel certain my three-year-old son will miss him, miss that he never got to see him perform in person.

I miss Freddie Mercury.
What defense officials are not answering: - whether they think Congress must get specific notification of each funding change - how much money exactly we are talking about - and what types of projects will lose funding
ALSO NEW - THIS: Defense officials say the one pot of construction money they won’t use for a wall is the funds for military family housing.
NEW: I asked seniors Pentagon officials the timeline for the natl  emergency/building the barrier...  Answer: they expect to be done assessing what they want to do in “weeks”... and be ready to start doing it in “months”.
Good news: is I do have more information from the Pentagon on the national emergency plan/process/timing   Bad news: it is embargoed (can’t report it) until 5:30 p ET
@kokatort Thank *you* for watching!
HUGE for us!! So glad Ali.  And for you too - you’re joining the greatest team. https://t.co/V6rYpNrdE1
@brifokine Appreciate that!
And PS I happen to be wearing the least Pentagon outfit ever.  This is camo -  nowhere. https://t.co/hofsIoBAKJ
And now: I’m at the Pentagon for their side of how the emergency declaration will work.
PELOSI: the president is not only acting against the Constitution of the United States, he is dishonoring the office he serves.
PELOSI: our plan is to vote on the resolution to terminate the emergency declaration on Tuesday.
DEMOCRAT JOAQUIN CASTRO says they have 226 or 227 co-sponsors for his resolution to terminate the emergency declaration.  He says that includes Republican @justinamash.
SMOLLETT: Chicago PD say they used footage from 55 cameras (some city, some private) to track the initial suspects, as well as video obtained inside the *cab* they took.

@danmaize omg
@scotpgot Absolutely.  But not the links in my story that just went dead.
@LACaldwellDC @hardball @SteveKornacki I blame Twitter for this - but whah? It is good tweeting, just I'm confused. (And turning on the hearing now...)
@KaraGormleyM Nice!!!
@noisybrooklyn1 It is not much better but at least there is a bio and links to *something*.  But it really is ridiculous that this is the new roll-out plan. Grrrrr.
@alethlete68 Was sort of a take on bwah bwah.  (Sad trombone.)
@KaraGormleyM YOU are just wonderful Kara, feeling such joy for all of you from this.    (Helping mitigate my frustration at Bernie Sanders for taking down all of his website policy content THE DAY he announces. Grrr.  So thank you. )
Love this topic.  Here's to add to the thread.  https://t.co/y70lWsx72Z https://t.co/eETHOcEcRl
@PoliticoScott @ShaneGoldmacher I just wish his website were working at the moment.  (Or they hadn't taken down all the policy content without replacing it today.)
Bwah wah.   As Bernie Sanders announces his run for president, looks like the campaign website links to his actual policies are gooone.  https://t.co/LgquAA8FMB…  https://t.co/A6YyImT2qJ…  And *no* menu on the homepage... (that I can find).  https://t.co/a7niGRK3pT

CALIFORNIA AG BECERRA: The liklihood is we will be filing an action, very soon, in court (to try to block the president's national emergency aciton).
NEWS: SCOTUS will hear the census case on whether the Trump admin. can ask if people are U.S. citizens or not.  And they will do it quickly. Arguments will be in April.

Thanks everybody!  Good luck to our new attorney general.  --end scene--
Q11: North Korea, what has been accomplished? Will we see something concrete?  POTUS Ansr 11: Alot's been accomplished. No rockets, no missiles, no testing. But  more importantly we have a great relationship. Japan's Prime Min. Abe nominated me for a Nobel Peace Prize.
Q10: The national debt is now over 22 trillion - what are your plans to deal with that?  POTUS Anr 10: Well it's all about growth. Also Obama raised the debt.  First though I have to worry about the military.  Get the military straightened out.  Growth will solve this.
Q9: Folo up on China tariffs...?  POTUS ansr: There is possibility that if we are close to a good deal, I may push back those tariffs.
Q8: Can you comment on the government stats that clearly show most drugs come through ports of entry.  POTUS ansr 8: I use many stats.  The stats I get from Homeland Security are a disaster.    (Attempt to folo up - POTUS moves on.)
POTUS ansr 7 (more): That is a political question and a fake question.  (He also made it clear he does not believe data showing undocument immigrants commit fewer crimes than native americans.)
Q7: Can u comment on disconnect w/ you talking about a crisis at border but there is DHS data showing fewer border crossings, undoc'd immigrants commit crimes at lower levels? (Are you creating an emergency?)  POTUS ansr7: Ask the angel moms - do they think I am creating?
Q6 (same reporter as Q5): What has been influence of conservative commentators on you?  POTUS Ansr 6: Sean Hannity shares my beliefs, he would not back me if I changed Rush Limbaugh (is amazing, skilled). Ann Coulter, I don't know her. I haven't talked to her in over a yr.
Q5: You said you were too new to politics at first, are you saying you are learning...  POTUS Ansr: Well I am new.  I am v disappointed in certain ppl, a partic. one, for not pushing this hrder.  Folo: Spkr Ryan?  POTUS: Let's not talk about it.  I'd like comprhnsv. imm. reform.
POTUS answr 4 (more): If China gives me even 50% of everything, Democrats would still say "that's a bad deal".    What I'm thinking of doing is getting Pelosi, Schumer and we'll all go together and we'll negotiate (w/ China). I'll put them in the room and let them speak up.
Q4: Do you think enough progress has been made in China talks to avoid the next set of tariffs, set for March?  POTUS ansr 4: I happen to like tariffs. ... I love tariffs. Also love them to negotiate. Now China is paying billions in tariffs and I haven't started yet.
Q3: You yourself said Pres. Obama's use of exec powers was not how things should happen and he should have dealt w/ Congress ...?  POTUS Ansr 3:  I went through Congress, I got a deal. I'm not happy w/ it.  I just want to get it done faster. (Congress is obstructing.)
Q2: How respond to those who say this will lose in court and if not, is a bad precedent?  POTUS Ansr 2: Precedents are far less important than having a border.  Sadly I think we will be sued and happily we will win. I think.
@Rhaj_the_wonder I got you, definitely.
Pres. Trump newser thread!  Q1: How can you guarantee military won't lose necessary funds?  POTUS Answr: I was briefed and this money is not critical. "Didn't seem too important to me." We are already rebuilding the military.
Trump remarks summary:  China Great Britain North Korea (Russia nod) ISIS Border Economy Border China Border Economy  Border, border, border The courts (battle ahead) Travel ban Border  Questions?
@silverinpapio This and drug trafficking are the topics he brings up the most regularly when talking about border issues.  But he often speaks more at length about human trafficking.
The president has a consistent concern about human trafficking.    He now is saying that it's harder for traffickers to go thru ports of entry, which is true.   However, he is incorrect in speaking of trafficking in terms of ppl being bound and gagged.  It  is seldom like that.
Pres. Trump: Democrats say the drugs  all come through the ports of entry. It's a lie. It's all a lie.   (Admin officials say while there is increased drug flow outside ports of entry, 90 percent of drugs still come thru ports of entry.)
Or this alternate theory may be more on point. https://t.co/igKWKo5BOg
PRES. TRUMP now speaking.  Starting with China, UK.  FEELS LIKE: This could be a long one, with an opening for (maybe a lot) of reporter questions.  Amicrazy?
FYI.  (Though, as I've noted "barely a day" translates into about seven years in congressional crisis time.) https://t.co/qYoZR19L0k
GOP Senators giving three different kinds of responses to the emergency declaration news:   1. I’ll support, it’s not ideal, but what else could he do?  2. I need to know exactly how he does it - what he does. 3. I’m Lindsey Graham. (He loves it).
SEN KAMALA HARRIS, when we asked about the emergency declaration , stopped on way to vote, turned and said “I think it’s ridiculous “
AND SHUTDOWN AVERTED (likely).  McConnell says the president will sign the deal and the Senate plans to vote on it starting 3:30.
UPDATE: no update on when the Senate will vote on the deal to avert a shutdown.   (Deadline tomorrow - which is like 7 years in Senate crisis time.)
@seungminkim @LACaldwellDC @GarrettHaake @heatherscope @BresPolitico To re-raise this tweet.   I now am consciously telling myself that today is Friday.  I don't care that it's not. I need to believe it.
Border Deal Vote Timing:  SENATE - Senate to vote on the Barr nom. at 12:30p - Possibility: @senatemajldr tries to move to the border deal vote immed. after that.  - He can do it if no one objects.  - This is definitely speculation.  HOUSE - Plans to vote 8:15 - 9:15p.
@albyselkie I've searched for Big Bend and do not seen any mention of it in the bill or the report.    Does not place any limits, other than the natural ones I expect, there.
No words. https://t.co/AtTA60IGFF
ICYMI, conf. committee member Tom Graves, R-Ga., was not ready to say yes to to the deal last night.  (His vote not a factor in whether it lives or dies, just notable b/c he was on the committee and it did meet those two times.) https://t.co/hBUebPO73x
NO TIMING yet on when the Senate will vote on the border deal.  (If any of my @NewsHour colleagues in our morning meeting w/ me now are reading this, could you show this to Russ Clarkson?)
THIS.  Buried deep inside this border deal, Congress says detainees shld be treated better.  "... facilities should be equipped w approp. temp. controls and avoid chain-link fence-type enclosures."  "CBP is encouraged to use a more appropriate blanket type than currently used."
@DwightShellman 1159.  With a 609 page accompanying report.
AIR TRAVEL is in this border deal too. It funds:  - 1144 new TSA officers - 50 new canine teams (@lizzieohreally!) - deployment of 203 new hi-tech CT (computed technology) scanners
THE BORDER DEAL includes:  - 1.9% fed worker pay raise for calendar year 2019 (retroactive to Jan.).  - VP Pence gets same raise. (He gets his own section.) - $1 billion for census (over last year) - 6 days of postal service delivery! (Keeping it as is.)
FAMILIES. The deal also funds:  - $192 million for new Customs and Border Patrol processing and holding site in El Paso meant especially for families and unaccompanied minors.
@frickchen It does!
@alex_veeneman Not remotely obtuse.   No timing yet.  But Senate will go tomorrow in first half of the day (Guessing 2p - 5p ish? Not sure.)  House will vote after 6:30p, they hope by 9p.
THIS. Just spotted in the border deal. To CBP/ICE from Congress.  "... facilities should be equipped with approp. temp. controls and avoid chain-link fence-type enclosures."   "CBP is encouraged to use a more appropriate blanket type than currently used."  I mean.
HUMANITARIAN relief in this deal:  - Total $414 mill, but having trouble seeing all of it at moment. Do see: 1. $128 mill for medical staff for Customs and Border Patrol 2. $40 mill for food, formula, diapers 3. $24 mill for increased transport b/t CBP facilities.
IMMIGRATION COURTS in this border deal:  - Funding for 50 new judges over last year's amount.  - An additional 89 of last year's slots still unfilled. - Priority for hiring must be in highest workload areas.
@InMySuitcase Yep. Stand by.
DETENTION/DETAINEES in this deal:  - Funds 45,274 detention spaces, avg. daily,  for the year. (Currently at 49,000. Last year funded 40,000.) - But also a big 22% increase in alternatives to detention program (to 100,000 ppl).  - $30 million for family case management support
@cajunmusicmp3 I love it! Just missed it was sarcastic. Not enough sarcasm in legislation.
ICE in this deal:   - Gets 112 new health staff at detention facilities - Must file weekly reports on detainees and a monthly report on family separations and minor referrals. - Sees increase of $95 million over last year for "custody operations" (3%)
BORDER/CUSTOMS AGENTS:  - Funds the 200 border patrol agents hired since Oct. - No new border patrol agents for rest of year. - Funds 600 new Customs agents for this year. - And funds additional recruiting to help fill some 600 open slots.  So aim is 1200 Customs agents.
@MarkP21 @JMGaylord Mark great job.  Exactly.
WHAT'S IN the Mega Border Security deal.  BARRIERS. - $1.375 billion in funds - Cannot be built in several parks or nature reserves. - DHS must consult with cities affected on design - at least until Sept. 30, 2019.  Nothing can be built during consultations.
Ok here comes a thread on what is in this bill, combining what Dems are highlighting and what GOP is highlighting.  Some will be repetitive folks.  But will be a new thread.
@JudyWoodruff @IAmAmnaNawaz @NewsHour We are lucky!!  Congratulations Judy!!!!
BORDER SECURITY MEGABILL - here's a 14 pg summary of the 1100+ pg bill.  In case you would like to sleep.  https://t.co/JBuxLShl60
TEXT of the bill!!  Is here: https://t.co/dUqHfBPdOH  Whoa. 1159 pages.  BUT is searchable!
OTHER SPENDING in the deal:  - $1.2 billion for infrastructure - $1.3 billion for housing, include rental assistance and homeless services - $267 million for tribal health - $30 million for opioid crisis (? assuming that's specific program - seems very small ?)  per Dem aide.
All per Dem aide. Should hear from GOP soon.
BORDER DEAL includes:  - 600 new Customs officers - 75 new immigrant judge teams  - $527 million to go to Central American countries to address crises driving emigration.
OTHER BORDER SECURITY $.  - Total increase of $1.7 billion (year to year). - Biggest chunk: $564 mill. for drug inspex, scanners at over-land ports of entry. - $414 mill. for "humanitarian concerns" at border (eager to get details) - $191 mill. for new construx at ports of entry
NEW - BARRIER FUNDING. No $ in the deal can be used for barriers in:  - Santa Ana Refuge - *La* Lomita Park - Bentsen-Rio State Park - National Butterfly Center - Vista del Mar and east.  Per Dem aide.
@cajunmusicmp3 ? I don't understand ?
BILL IS FILED!  Don't see text online yet but do have some details from sources.  Stand by. Here they come.  *shakes, blows on fingers*
Me now.  Waiting for the bill. https://t.co/Rq1Obbut4z
Timing on shutdown deal:  - Mult. sources: the *Senate* now will vote first tomorrow. - Why? Codels, I'm told. - Meaning they are leaving town soon after voting. - Unclear: how this works if POTUS ends up saying he won't sign... (clearly assumptions running hard other way.)
NEW: The border/shutdown deal is done and text has been forwarded to conferees, says Dem aide.  They were given *1 hour* to take a look.  Then it will be filed with the House. (And hopefully publicly.)
@CTMeir @NewsHour I really do hear you but wasn't trying to be sly.
NEW: negotiations over contractor pay and extending VAWA have ended w no deal on either.  Both will be OUT of the border deal, according to senior Dem aide.
@ktumulty If by "ruined" you mean having set an example of how women can kick ass in print, on tv and in being a phenomenal person, then apology accepted.
@CTMeir @NewsHour This is good feedback.  We absolutely do check facts and I never present any statement by a politician that is patently false  w/out pointing that out (or playing sound of those questioning it).   But I think this tweet stands on its own...
NOW.  House just passed a bill that would end US support of Saudi-led war in Yemen.  AND  House GOP just won a rare vote, with the chamber passing a resolution that the US should oppose anti-Semitism and *boycotts* of US allies. (Target: BDS and @IlhanMN)
President Trump now: "The wall is very very, it's on the way. It's being built now."
@mixedcircuits Some could apply, some could not depending on a few variables.    But you are right that it was work not done. Though that is also the case for most fed workers who have already received backpay.
YEAH! https://t.co/ES4lcvKBZg
@dtwyman @joncoopertweets @JudyWoodruff @ktumulty @DavidCornDC @maddow @SRuhle @rcallimachi @brooklynmarie @abbydphillip @AprilDRyan @NPRinskeep @DomenicoNPR @RonanFarrow @costareports @Acosta @JuddLegum @KFILE @NewsHour @ProPublica @MotherJones Thank you!!!
THE BORDER DEAL: - WILL include 1.9% pay raise for fed workers, Hoyer confirms  - UNKNOWN if it will include backpay for contractors, Hoyer says.  He hopes so but says it looks like GOP opposes at the moment.
BORDER/SHUTDOWN DEAL TIMING (as of now), per Hoyer: - text after 4p today - House vote after 6:30p tomorrow.  - this is because of Rep Dingell’s funeral in DC 10:30a tomorrow and Rep. Jones’ funeral in NC 1:30p.

@WilliamHeagney Got it.
I keep asking lawmakers in both parties whether they think detention space is increasing or decreasing in this deal.  Republicans say increasing. Some Dems say decreasing. Only Durbin really got it right - it’s the same.   (Many reasons, including ICE keeps flexibility to add $)
VIEW FROM THE SENATE: rank and file members of both parties say they think it is a seemingly fair deal - or as fair as can get.  Several members stress they are waiting for the text. (Tomorrow at soonest.)
THIS.  @RepMarkMeadows just told us “I think the president will sign this.” Reluctantly, he said, but he will sign it.   And then use exec powers to build the wall.   (Meadows, by the way, is voting no.)
President Trump: I don't think you will see a shutdown. If we did have it, it's the Democrats' fault.
POTUS: I'm not happy (with the conf. deal) but am I happy with where we are going? I'm thrilled.    The bottom line, we're building a lot of wall. Right now we're building a lot of wall.
Note this is different than his more shut-it-down-Mr.-President rhetoric of December.   (But keep watching the president and this space.) https://t.co/HSMfI1P18i

BREAKIING: border and shutdown negotiators are coming back at 6p. Those leaving say it was a good meeting. Shelby said he doesn’t think a CR would be needed, at least he doesn’t think so.
I’m told there are a few staff members in the border/shutdown talks w the big four appropriators.
Inside the room where lawmakers are meeting (Senate official photo at top of this webpage - door is closed now, as per previous tweet.)  https://t.co/Pa7ZDSsBPQ
And now let me add to the many versions of this on the Twitter.   It’s where the border security/shutdown negotiators are meeting.  And actually one of the most beautiful rooms at the Capitol.  (Link to a pic inside in next tweet.) https://t.co/oZjdQfgb8v
Apropos of nothing: @SenatorLeahy popped in a piece of gum as he walked into the meeting. #ReporterWaitingForNews https://t.co/x4NlX2jymI
NOW: border security conf committee meeting.   GOP @RepKayGranger quipped, “I’m always optimistic.  I’m also realistic.” https://t.co/OvGzAEDNVn
KEY BORDER TALKS NUMBERS:  Dems want to cap interior ICE detention at: 16,500 avg daily.   Dems say current figure is about: 20,700 daily.  Asking GOP two questions: 1. is that accurate? 2. What is breakdown of the crimes for that group? Misdemeanors or worse?
NOW: PELOSI and House Dem Leaders are calling for Rep. @IlhanMN to apologize for her remarks.    They wrote: "Congresswoman Omar’s use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters is deeply offensive."
RIP Rep. Walter Jones.   Among other things, arguably the most consistent and unrelenting conservative when it came to fighting the deficit/debt.
All sides agree tomorrow is the deadline to get a border agreement done in time for it to pass by Friday.  Options if agreement doesn't happen:  1. "Outline" of a deal is released, Congress funds agencies short-term while negotiators work out language. 2. A longer CR  3. Shutdown
In other words:  We are in fact closer to another shutdown. How much closer is not yet clear.
BORDER TALK BREAKDOWN, (mult. sources): - Dems want to cap detention beds at 16,500 - (Dem source) But GOP wanted that cap to exempt those w/ other criminal charges (not just undocumented).  - Dems felt that would make a cap moot. GOP felt cap is dangerous, force crim. release.
Something worth reading every Saturday morning for at least the next year.   Thank you @JohnDingell (and @RepDebDingell).  https://t.co/8Or7nK7Lov
MUELLER TIMING.  Asked what he meant when he said the Mueller investigation is "close" to completion soon, acting AG Whitaker says he does not want to add anything to what he said.  (He also did not subtract anything.)

CHILD SEPARATION HEARING NOW.  Rep. Schakowsky: Does anyone know how many children were separated from their parents?  (No answer from panel.)  Schakowsky: Does anyone know how many separated kids are still in U.S. custody?  (No answer.)  Schakowsky: No one knows.
PELOSI: Hopefully we'll get some good news in a short period of time... on the border security conference committee.  (Translation: "short time" is relative, seems to  mean before middle of next week and definitely by Feb. 15 deadline.)
Spoiler: it's because of the shutdown and missing data (b/c of the shutdown). https://t.co/gjS5BI15fa
@tippytops1 @NewsHour I don't understand. But glad for feedback. Any more specifics? I was just pointing out one dynamic at one committee hearing.
NOW - fascinating dynamic:  in House Oversight, Dem firebrand freshmen Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Tlaib in foreground   GOP firebrands Meadows, Jordan in background.    The two ends of ideological spectrum are nearly the only members in the room. https://t.co/CyFScAQygp
NEW - this:  Durbin told me and other reporters that border patrol officials verified to the conf committee (the one trying to work out a deal) that 90% of illegal drugs crossing the border come through legal ports.  That’s counter to the president’s rhetoric.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib on the president’s words on socialism: “I think a lot of people don’t understand it.”
I counted a conservative 28 topics that State of the Union.
SOTU topics more: - women in the workplace (and Congress) - China - NAFTA - drug prices - HIV epidemic - childhood cancer - paid family leave - abortion - NATO - Russian missiles - Venezuela - socialism - the Middle East - Jerusalem - ISIS - Afghanistan - USS Cole  - Iran
SOTU all topics, in order (thread): - party over country - American heroes (WWII, space) - economic boom - the tax cut - obamacare - US as energy exporter - “ridiculous partisan investigations” - nominees - criminal justice reform - the border, in several parts
About 2/3 through at 55 min mark.
Just over halfway through the speech at about 45 minutes in.
The irony of the pro-woman section is that there are fewer *Republican* women in Congress now than in recent years.    (Just 21 out of 252 Republicans in Congress are women.)
NEWLY ADDED TO THE SPEECH: were the president’s lines about how Congress voted for the wall in the past but it didn’t get built and “I will get it built!”  (Context: Congress did vote for specific fencing with wording that excluded a wall.)
CLASS ISSUE? The president is about to say: “no issue better illustrates the divide between America’s WORKING CLASS and America’s POLITICAL class than illegal immigration.”  (Capitialization is the WH’s)
At 23 min mark, the president is just over a quarter of the way through the speech.

SOTU Excerpt! WH official told reporters Pres. Trump plans to say: "Together we can break decades of political stalemate, we can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock extraordinary promise of America’s future.”
President Trump's SOTU THEME is "choosing greatness", a senior admin. official told press just now.
This is thoughtful but as a Virginia student who learned in trailers, I object to wussi-ness implied:   "...students are often forced to walk outside of their schools to nearby parking lots; often arriving to class cold and wet..."    Think going outside is not the issue here. https://t.co/LmNOPI26yX
Thread for possible weekend discussion. https://t.co/DJDzgoZD88
Booker snags first Senate endorsement of 2020 cycle.  It's a smart move, but part of it is Booker sitting in a lucky position. Others (Gillibrand, Harris) who've announced so far have other home-state senators in leadership (Schumer, Feinstein) who are less able to endorse now. https://t.co/dpBBkLbPuX
@DavidNCook1 True!! @JudyWoodruff

@ELBordeaux It is even more beautiful than I remembered
@ELBordeaux OMG MAPPY.  I have to look.
@ELBordeaux So indescribably grateful.

The abortion debate - aiming to shed some light in a week of heat.   Watch here: https://t.co/po4EDpexUB
Northam: "We believe that women and their doctors should be trusted with decisions about their reproductive health."
NOW: VA Gov. Northam - "Misinformation has been circulating on where VA Democrats stand on the subject of women's reproductive health"    (thread...)
Two helpful things!  Clip of Pelosi's words today on fencing: https://t.co/XxqMO3HZXk  Wth Normandy fencing is: https://t.co/DiQxT6cyLI
THIS. PELOSI recap:  1. Pelosi: "There's not going to be any wall money" in the border security deal.  2. Later, me: "Should enhanced fencing be on the table?"  3. Pelosi: "Is there a place for ‘enhanced fencing’? Normandy fencing would work, let them have that discussion."
Pelosi now, to my question opened the door for the conf committee to talk about enhanced fencing, where it makes sense.  But she clearly is trying to keep the  miles of possible fence limited and most border money for other things .
PELOSI: Bluntly, "There's not going to be any wall money" in the conf. committee deal.
PELOSI: "Hopefully we can do something to help our contractors."   (Who are not getting back pay and have lost a month's salary b/c of the shutdown.)
TWO MINUTES: to @SpeakerPelosi newser.
Thread on who is crossing the border --&gt; https://t.co/LekTnBNFl6
Two things:  1. This is a substantive start to the border security talks - remarks focusing on substance in general.  2. Roughly 80% of staffers not in the front row are busy texting and doing work and lawmakers talk. (Which may include border security!)
NOW: GOP Rep. Graves is asking, clarifying if House Dems have a border security proposal they are circulating.  Rep. Roybal-Allard says she is finalizing it now and will send it around.
Sen. Blunt exits.
Looks like most or all of the conf. committee would like to make comments.
@steven_maines @TomCottonAR no
@MizTiques7 On this committee the Republican from Texas is Kay Granger.
@StevenTDennis Difficult to wall.
Dem. Rep. Roybal-Allard (speaking now) has long been a border security expert for her caucus.  As she's explaining now, she's previously proposed large increases in numbers of border patrol agents.
None of the senators on this conference committee lives in a southern border state.
@JoshX1993 @SenCapito @PBS @NewsHour @wetatvfm @wnet @CPBmedia Thanks Joshua.  @sencapito will be on the show tonight!
NOW: Chair @NitaLowey + @repkaygranger are making history as first female Approps chair and ranking member ever to anchor a conference committee.

A House member has arrived!   Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-TN.
What’s the delay for the conf committee?, you may be asking.  The House began a series of votes not long before this meeting was scheduled - and is still voting.  Senators definitely not given a heads up and are sitting quietly, affably waiting.
That time the entire press corps slowly edged into @ericawerner’s chat w a newsmakers.
Seems to be going well so far. https://t.co/ZWYhAT9Zqa

@jamiedupree Exactly - hence "recent" as they've clearly avoided coming back to that...

@jeremycoleman Well, laugh, that is a big question for the internet as you may know.    If I understand your question correctly, my reply is that THIS is used to mean all kinds of things, but mainly, I believe, "look at this" or "this is interesting".
@rivog54 @Lyrikris10 thank you!
THIS.  The big Worldwide Threats Assessment just released by U.S. intelligence officials mentions "climate" as a threat more often than "migrants".   (Five times for "climate", three for "migrants". Sure, that's close. But significant given WH policy.)   https://t.co/dGG3kJs89w
@jackielouwho1 @Lyrikris10 Thank you! We have THE BEST viewers in the world.

"The table has been perfectly set by the president (for a border security deal)", says @PressSec Sanders.
THIS - WH ADVISOR KUDLOW: We plan for the next budget to have "at a least 5% reduction" in non-defense accounts, across-the board.  (Of course that is the POTUS budget, which has limited impact on final funding, but it is notable that this is the WH starting point.)
@b_arthurs_tunic @USCBO Not at all. It's a big report and bad luck when specific numbers repeat.  Also I have a not-small advantage: can talk in person w/ CBO folks to check that I'm reading things correctly.
@b_arthurs_tunic @USCBO Sharp eyes, but that's not the $3 b figure/place I'm referencing. Look two bullet points lower.   "Although most of the real GDP lost ... will eventually be recovered, CBO estimates that about $3 billion will not be."
@USCBO INTEREST on the debt is a monster.  - NOW: US spends $325 billion (b) a year on interest on the debt.   - It's enough to pay for: all college tuition + universal prek + potentially walls on both borders. - AND AHEAD: this almost triples, to $928 b in interest by 2029.   (Per CBO)
LONGTERM DEFICIT OUTLOOK. Is really quite sobering, daunting.  @USCBO concludes:  - DEBT: By 2039, US gov's debt will be record 117% of GDP.  - Previous record was about 106% of GDP, due to World War II.
BREAKING:  The U.S. economy lost $3 billion because of the shutdown and will never make it up, @USCBO concludes.  Context: that's tiny part of GDP so does *not* affect longterm GDP growth.  But: it's half of what POTUS wanted, and did not get, for border barriers.  And it's gone.
@USCBO ECONOMY OVERALL. @USCBO estimates:  - A LITTLE BETTER, BUT STILL BAD: Deficit projections are slightly down, to about $900 billion in 2019.  Hits $1 trillion in 2022 now, not 2020.  - MEH: GDP growth decreases to 2.3% this year, then below 2% for foreseeable future.
FINALLY, BACK TO SUBSTANCE.  Absurdly excited to be covering @USCBO’s Econ outlook report today.  And not a largely political shutdown fight.   Will send details as soon as embargo lifts. https://t.co/4ynK6o2Q71
@HistorianOren @JudyWoodruff @Yamiche There just wasn’t time to coordinate yesterday! Laugh.  Sincere thanks for a fantastic tweet - we are trying to tee things up for you historians.

GOVERNMENT IS OPEN.  President Trump just signed the three-week funding bill.  Shutdown: 35 days  How long it took to pass + sign bills ending shutdown: 5 hours.
Yes! https://t.co/YR06dZyfID
@achorowitz Maybe you meant "political" losers?
HOUSE TO PASS FUNDING BILLS, SEND TO PRESIDENT: in next 40 minutes or so.  We have just been told.
@j9duffy @BogusDickGrimm @rhpMike Read my mind!   But I'll wait until after the show.
@mike_melia @mtill50 @WidespreadPanic my reaction is being eclipsed by a hacking cough.
@makinibrice That is a great tweet.
@BogusDickGrimm @rhpMike Apologies! Exactly. They all sit on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Oh my goodness I've been here too long and am becoming one of these ppl that talks like a bureaucrat.
KEY BORDER SECURITY SENATORS:  These 7 senators were just appointed to conf. committee tasked with sorting out =barrier/wall/border security debate by Feb. 15.  GOP: Shelby, Capito, Hoeven, Blunt  Dems: Leahy, Durbin and Tester.  They are all appropriators.
NOW, SENATE PASSES FUNDING BILLS to reopen closed agencies: In less than four minutes.  But unanimous, voice vote. But the chamber was basically empty.  The two bills now (one DHS, one all other agencies) go to the House.  #ThatWasEasy
McConnell staffer telling us Senate about start voting process to end shutdown --&gt; https://t.co/JswzrutOnm
@AndreasLupus @ActuallyTLo @medit8now @JustJake_91 I endorse!
Forgive some brief self-righteousness (which I admit never makes things better).   But I can't believe that at the Capitol now I was the only reporter asking about federal contractors and @StevenTDennis was the only one asking about DREAMers.
BREAKING and IMPORTANT - CONTRACTORS: I ran to ask both Pelosi and Schumer now about them.   BOTH SAID they are working on ways to pay them back. So there’s hope, but far from sure.   “We’re gonna try to help them,” Schumer.  “It’s intolerable (their situation)”, Pelosi.
2 MIN until PELOSI/SCHUMER
NEW: Schumer newser in 30 at the Cap.
@cjcsenar @j9duffy Ding ding ding
NOW: McConnell talking and Schumer on Senate floor. A few other senators - Murkowkski, Collins - in seats.
HEADS UP: McConnell is coming to the floor in a minute, we are told.
Cc: contractors https://t.co/ucxuDxKbWs
NOW: at capitol we are gathering around phones (@sarahdwire’s here) listening to POTUS and guessing some fast unanimous consent votes may be coming. (Votes w most members gone, no roll call.) https://t.co/hQCOvNnC74
@nvasconcelos Ah! Sorry.  They will get some $$ unclear to me if they’ll spend it on vehicles
@nvasconcelos A lot happening but isn’t that what it says? Sorry...?
BREAKING - THE DEAL: Dem source says leaders are zeroing in on... - clean CR to Feb 15 - *No wall $* - vehicle for DHS, border security conf bill - Senate votes first - backpay provision
1:27p we are all waiting for POTUS.’ remarks. https://t.co/sGsxgL6CUY
Sen Susan Collins enters GOP lunch also giving no details, also hopeful. @ United States Capitol https://t.co/JiVaFfLXXD
GRASSLEY NOW: I hope that we can put something on this to make continuing resolutions automatic... (raises voice) AND WE END SHUTDOWNS FOREVER!! https://t.co/QkoQGcuOsl
ONE POSITIVE DYNAMIC  ar this moment (to me), the reporters  staking here at the Capitol right now are vets and pros.   Not the parachuting in en masse we’ve seen a lot in last year.
Sen. Cory Gardner walks through double red-rover style lines of reporters, is swarmed, says he knows nothing about what’s going on at moment.
NOW: our band of four reporters/ photographers waiting outside the Senate earlier this hour has grown to 30. @ United States Capitol https://t.co/8MFfK3s5no
NEW - THIS: GA GOP Sen Perdue just told us he hopes the shutdown “ends in the next 10 minutes”.
Durbin also told us he thinks most senators have left town.  (Many offices confirm this thought.)
Durbin emerges. Says he knows only that Schumer and McConnell spoke.  But hopes something can happen. We tell him POTUS expected soon. @ United States Capitol https://t.co/ogehcCU5Gy
Quiet on Senate side too - see 3 reporters outside chamber - as Durbin speaks and buzz of POTUS saying something flies around. @ United States Capitol https://t.co/fpJPnf8e49
WAITING AT THE CAPITOL SCENE 1: The great Chad Pergram of FOX and I are only signs of life near Statuary Hall at the moment, as leaders wait for word from MCCONNELL/WH. @ United States… https://t.co/CvlDGgCCXa
However, as someone who watches planes at Ntl Airport ALOT (my two-year is obsessed + we can see from his room), does feel like much slower than usual takeoff and (esp) landing pattern.  Have not seen a plane land in many minutes and the usual line of them in the sky not there.
AT THE MOMENT: seem to be plenty of arrivals at Reagan National Airport in DC.  Passengers telling me either no delay or short delay, but all I talked w were coming from the west.   Do wonder what the Gipper would make of this. https://t.co/opicE53fUt
HEADS UP: This could easily, quickly get national nightmare worse.  Airport delays and stoppages are on the east coast so far, where the business day is fully underway.  But as flight scheds ramp up in other time zones, seems v poss., even likely, this spreads.
ATTN: Congress and WH. https://t.co/FqPnL0gGhr
@sgoewey @greatbluheron @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff @SpeakerPelosi It is not to say she is bad or the same as Trump.  Just that she is the tougher face for Democrats in this negotiation.  Which Democrats on the Hill also say.
@sgoewey @greatbluheron @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff @SpeakerPelosi My sincere thanks for this feedback.  I wish I had more time to explain the metaphor. Perhaps I should not have attempted it. The idea is she is not compromising, she is standing her ground and pushing back at the president. As Schumer/McConnell reach out.
@SaltyWorley cc: @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump
Big thanks to @VanessaDennis for some quick how-many-days-is-that? help.
KEY MATH.   Pro-rated barrier $ could be $53 million to $2 billion.  Variables.  IF start at $1.3b (CR) then it's $463 milln if pro-rating since Oct 1 or $53 milln if next 15 days (until Feb. 8).  IF start at $5.7 b (Trump) then it's $2 b (since Oct.) or $234 million (15 days)
Let's talk pro-rating.
@lindsemcpherson .@annaedge4 : Are you sending the president a letter regarding border security?  Pelosi: No.  Me: Are you holding a news conference tomorrow?  Pelosi: Yes.  (3/3)
@lindsemcpherson Reporter: do you know what he’s talking about w the down payment?  Pelosi: I don’t know if he knows what he’s talking about. Do you?  Reporter: What think about pro-rated idea: Pelosi: I don’t know what that means.  (2/3)
PELOSI: few minutes ago w/ few of us.  Pelosi: The president said if senators have reasonable agreement he will support it...  Reporter @lindsemcpherson: what think of a 'large down payment' on the wall...?  Pelosi: But that is not a reasonable agreement with the senators   (1/3)
And FYI McConnell Schumer meeting has ended.  Things are noticeably quiet.    Which USUALLY is a good sign.  But who knows.  (hallway h/t @kristinapet)
THE (POTENTIAL) GRAHAM DEAL:  - Some money for barriers. (Wording TBD.) - TPS recipients get permanent legal status. - DACA recipients get perm status at least.
WH confirms McConnell and Schumer are meeting to try to work shutdown deal... or get closer to one.  Not at all clear how big/small this coudl be.
@lrozen Thank you! Email and twitter traffic jam.
WHERE WE ARE*: A near majority of the Senate voted for the president’s plan (50 votes) and a majority voted for the Dems plan (52).  So most senators just want this to end.  *corrects numbers in past tweet
DEMOCRATS PLAN also fails to get 60 in the Senate. 52-44.  One more yes vote than the president’s plan.
TRUMP PLAN FAILS to get 60 Senate votes.  Goes down 51-47.
GRAHAM on why GOP lunch w Pence has gone long “there are a lot of ideas.” Is his gaining traction (3-week temp reopening of gov)? “Maybe”
NOW:  a couple dozen House Democrats just entered the Senate chamber to watch the shutdown votes.  Meantime, GOP Senators lunch w @vp is going looong.  (So they haven’t voted yet.) https://t.co/aE8aYpyn7h
NOW: VP Pence here on the Hill.
@LisaDNews PELOSI: "As you know last night the president accepted the fact that the State of the Union should be at a *time* when we can talk about the state of the union. ...  I'm glad we got that off the table."
SOON: We expect @SpeakerPelosi to begin her newser.  See streaming here: https://t.co/unEXqjUbRK
JUST NOW: House passed bill to fun Homeland Security through Feb. 28.  (DOA on Senate side currently, as have been the other nearly dozen bills House Dems have passed along these lines.)
Spotted. The great @SusanPage at the Pelosi newser, as we wait for the Speaker.   (Set to start 10:45 am ET - watch here: https://t.co/unEXqjUbRK )
@RachelEveStein They still have spittoons in the current Senate Chamber.
@vplus I think he often uses them as if they are bolding devices.  But just a theory.
@davlinnews @Yamiche Thank you - that is much appreciated.
@mequantum Not sure I understand.
NEW.  Top Dem leadership source says they - like us - got notice of POTUS' decision on SOTU via Twitter minutes ago.
BREAKING: President to delay State of Union as long as shutdown continues. https://t.co/52pUrmgNNZ
THIS https://t.co/52pUrmgNNZ
CHAD!   All true, but listen, a) too soon (for me) and b) more importantly, If you get too dark on us, I do not know where to look for straight, smart, knows-this-place hope. https://t.co/s8w01EawKf
@sklogw42 @kathrynw5 wow this is a reference I had not thought of.   I'm sad he is not the one who hid in the oak.
@DijksterhuisJJ Except the entire house must approve the resolution for the invite.
@seungminkim At risk, nay certainty, of being obnoxious: https://t.co/DmDdLI3UIO  It's just I am never eahead of you on anything. So feel obligation to my worst self to point this out.
NEW: SOTU preps are not happening at the Capitol, I'm told by multiple offices and groups involved.  Example: NBC (as pool) was to bring in production trucks tomorrow.  Now that is not happening. Their crew is in limbo.  Why no prep? One source: "There is no speech right now."
I can tell you this:   Every Capitol Police officer I've spoken with would be so happy if the SOTU leaves the Capitol, never to return.  And that has zero to do with the shutdown.
SO tech. possible scenarios now:  - Trump goes to a House chamber with no lights, sound or cameras on.  (Imagining would not be there long?) - Trump speaks in Sen Chamber + (I guess?) Dems must chose if attending.  - Trump goes to Old Senate Chamber - Trump speaks on the steps
@BruinSharman @cspan Good point - but it's not totally a however. Stand by.
From sources all over the Capitol:  - POTUS DOES have right to enter the House chamber, at anytime. - That includes if they are out of session, technically. - But he can't speak from podium or dais w/out express House permission.  I can't believe I'm writing all this.
@mikememoli Nice Mike
SOTU - WHERE WE ARE AT:  - Pelosi has now said firmly: No SOTU in House chamber until gov. reopens.  - The president has said he will give the speech next Tuesday.  - Issue is where. Options getting buzz: Rally Border Border rally State Capitol US Senate
“We need paychecks, no more food banks!” https://t.co/YmUXhOjI6B
NOW:  I counted 523 people in the silent protest of the shutdown now underway in Senate office building.   (Obviously not exact, but my best effort.)    These are combo of fed furloughed workers, union staff and non-furloughed workers. https://t.co/alGVL1g8pr
THIS.  Hoyer, asked by @DaviSusan about Dem lawmakers calling @realDonaldTrump racist: “a number of people don’t see a substantial difference between the rhetoric of Mr (Steve) King, (which Republicans took action against) and that which is used on a regular basis by the POTUS.”
NOW - SOTU NEWS.  Dem Caucus Chair Jeffries: “Unless government is reopened, it is highly unlikely the State of the Union will take place on the floor of the House.”  This is the most clear a House Dem Leader has been yet (publicly) about the speech.
BIGGEST NEWS TODAY - new poss Dem offer: H Homeland Sec Chair Thompson told  us he and @SpeakerPelosi, others are working on letter to POTUS with:  - more than $5.7 b new for border security, things like judges. - poss $ for repairing current wall, fences - no $ for new barriers
HOUSE DEMS: in their conf meeting just now only talked about State of the Union in terms of it likely not happening in House chamber if gov is still shut down.
NEW:  House Dems. committee chairs, rank and file all unanimous in talking w us that POTUS should not be able to speak in House next week if agencies still shut down.   Only exception: Bennie Thompson who deferred to @SpeakerPelosi and said he supports whatever she does.
@pnwjourneys @NewsHour Thank you for the feedback! I'm sorry I disappointed you and will try to get more specifics in the future. I wanted to make sure we had enough time to hit on all topics. But thank you!

Senate set to vote Thursday.  McConnell and Schumer have agreed to two votes:  1. Trump's plan. Wall $, DACA temp. status. 2. A CR until Feb. 8 with NO WALL $.  (Which the Senate passed unanimously before.)  Both need 60 to advance. https://t.co/TUuauJBDLA
Schumer: There were no serious negotiations w/ Democratic leaders or any Democrat that produced this proposal.
Schumer just called Sen. Leader McConnell a "co-conspirator in the shutdown".   So things are going well.   (Though, I do hold out some naive hope that this could be a last round of political swipes on both sides ahead of actual dealing.)

Republicans Jordan, Meadows on House Oversight say that Michael Cohen's attorney has said his hearing testimony will exclude:  - AG of NY investigations - US Attny of S. district of NY investigations - Mueller's investigation  But will include: - Personal anecdotes.
Yep, that's my belief but b/c there is confusion (and I got some off-the-mark guidance from high offices last week), I've asked the Sgt. at Arms office.  A long longshot, but since we are in  Aaron Sorkin-land, clearly... https://t.co/DVrwREeehJ
MEANWHILE for your speculation file:  The Senate historian tells me 9 U.S. presidents have given addresses in the Senate chamber.  The most recent was 1974.   (Yes, it's small.) (No, none of those was SOTU.) (Good points but mine: past precedent? Trump not so concerned.)
SHUTDOWN ADS: KY prison officers' union (part of AFGE) has put up billboards like this in the state to get @senatemajldr McConnell's attention.  I'm told there are four now, with plans for eight more. https://t.co/Fxgh8EMgA8
GOP offer: mostly "fencing".  This new Sen. bill does not spell out how to spend the $5.7 B, just points to two past laws.  Law 1: "physical barriers and fencing"   (Pg 555 here. https://t.co/lVBDrH4mio)  Law 2: "reinforced fencing"   (Pg 248 here. https://t.co/lVBDrH4mio)
Where is the wall money?   Welll - it's hard to spot in the bill. ($5.7 billion for "purposes authorized by section 102" of USC code blah blah. )  It's most clear here - in the report accompanying the Homeland Security section. Search for "barrier" https://t.co/87Umath16a
@RaniaBatrice THANK YOU for correcting! Will let our folks know and hopefully change early tomorrow am.

THINGS DEMS (amd some Repubs) WANT in general: - Dreamer path to citizenship - Ethics, campaign finance and voting rights bill - NY/NJ Gateway Tumnel  Among other things.   Cc: @realDonaldTrump
ONE BIG PROBLEM for the president's offer:  - DACA is currently in courts. 2 Fed. district courts blocked Trump admin from ending the program in Nov.  ONE NEGOTIATING PLUS FOR THE OFFER: - He does not want a wall "sea to sea" but instead a steel fence. - Tho still says "wall"
AND THIS IS BIG: Leader McConnell will have the Senate vote on Trump's idea this week, the president says.  - It is certain to need 60 votes - Seems certain to fall short  - But of course let's see what senators say.
Trump offers:  - 3 years of protection for DACA recipients and those here via TPS. - Weekly bipartisan meetings to figure out broader, permanent immigration reform.
Trump also announced what he said is "a new system for central american minors to apply for asylum in home countries".
Trump says his plan includes: - $800 million in humanitarian assistance - $805 million for drug-detection - 2750 border agents/law enf. - 75 new judge teams - $5.7 b for "physical barriers or a wall". NOT, he says concrete sea-to-sea, but steel in high priority areas.
Trump: I am here today to break the logjam.   Proposal I'm putting forward is based on input from border security professionals.
Meantime, a smart approach by a smart Democrat - get out with regular folks during this. https://t.co/pv9G0p7ipS
And actually the president is now speaking in a hybrid of campaign rhetoric, but with softer voice.
This is softer-tone Trump, not campaign rally Trump (so far).
NOW: POTUS speaking at WH.
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE SAYING:  - I'm putting DACA (back) on the table. And TPS recipients.  WHAT PELOSI SEEMS TO BE SAYING: - The only Dreamer deal we'll take is one that's permanent.  SEPARATELY: - V hard to see Dems taking anything less than path to citz. for Dreamers
NEW: Pelosi's office says the president's offer is 'inadequate' and cannot pass the House or Senate.   DEMS PUSH: remains the same. Reopen government, and then we'll talk.  SHUTDOWN also remains the same. Indefinite.
(ICYMI) CONFIRMED w/ mult. offices:  - The Senate has left for the next week. No votes are expected next week.  - Senators will get 24-hours'  notice of any votes. - SO: Senate essentially expecting no deal and that *fed workers will miss a second paycheck*

Dem Whip Clyburn: “gotta make a flight, I’m sorry”, gave no response to reporter questions about the president’s decision to cancel @SpeakerPelosi’s CODEL.
Team @NewsHour right now. Attempting a double box via tweet.... I’m outside Pelosi’s office waiting for her.   And @Yamiche... https://t.co/GB4gvdAVYv
McCarthy to us a few minutes ago: The Speaker of the House should not leave the country during a shutdown.  Reporters: but the president left the country during the shutdown - he went to Iraq.  McCarthy: and where was Nancy Pelosi then (Hawaii)...?  Me. So ...? ??
(MORE)   Me: But what do you think (about a steel-slat fence)?  @SpeakerPelosi: “But it doesn’t matter... what (can’t make our exact words) is that he will be able to open up government...”  Working on posting audio for everyone.
THIS.  Me to @SpeakerPelosi: “Madame Speaker, do you think a steel slat fence is a wall? Is that something you oppose?” ...   Pelosi: “Is it a wall in the president’s mind? The president’s mind is what this is about.”  (Note: she had just emphasized her opposition to a “wall”)
@terryhclay Yes, but we don't hear the mic feed.
My hearing is not the greatest (too many years of radio reporting and also a two-year-old who likes to yell right in myear) but in the second row at Pelosi, I am having trouble hearing her.  Can't tell if a sore throat may be involved. Or again, it's just my terrible hearing.
QUESTIONS FOR @SpeakerPelosi? Sitting waiting at her Newser now.   I''ve got a few but send your good, tough, but thoughtful ideas...!
Really this is amazing.  As Reps Katie Hill, @AOC, Lauren Underwood and others held a Sen elevator on way to McConnells office to ask to reopen gov, Dem Sen Chris Coons was looking for an elevator, passed by and said “who are they? House freshmen I assume?” Then “good for them”
And not allowed to take photos here but the Dem Frosh just went into the Senate to deliver their letter to McConnells desk.   It was very civil and polite, they needed directions briefly, doorkeeper asked @aoc to take off a button that looked issues/politically related.
NOW: House Dem frshmen just delivered letter to Leader McConnells office to vote on bills to reopen gov - most of them left but about 8, including @AOC, Lauren Underwood, Katie Hill, still inside. https://t.co/vWL6wu0OeX
My Q to Schumer now: “what is your offer on the shutdown?”  SCHUMER to me: We have had an offer, it is $1.3 billion. But we are clear that we need to reopen government first.  (Emphatic tone on those end words.)
“Hold up the signs!” Dem Leader Schumer tells the 19 Dems behind him holding photos of ppl affected by the shutdown. https://t.co/YS7WLfLp8J
NO vote on the King/anti-white nationalism resolution was CBC member Bobby Rush.
MCCONNELL: "Rep. King uttered words that are unacceptable in America today. I want to commend Leader McCarthy (for removing him from committees). It's entirely appropriate."
NOW: House GOP leaders news conference.    (Sign of being in the minority... and Dems having events at same time ... there are nearly as many staffers here as we reporters.) https://t.co/lS4Zkmsuem
NEW NOW. Frosh GOP @RepRiggleman just told me that in talking to Republicans and others he thinks a breakthrough in the shutdown is possible. And if it doesn’t happen by Friday, he’s ready for an idea like @LindseyGrahamSC’s for a few-week CR.
Republican starting the week with a bit of sarcasm.  (Though federal DC really is shut down b/c of snow.) https://t.co/4Zj3YfIKOO
@lplatosmith @NewsHour @kurteichenwald Well send good thoughts, I can't guarantee yet. But would like to do it if everything else cooperates.
@lplatosmith @NewsHour @kurteichenwald You are reading my mind! Been trying to find time to put together something like your first idea for days. Still hoping to this week.  Russia news and 2020 candidates making it tough. Gah.
@lplatosmith @NewsHour @kurteichenwald Thanks for the feedback but could you point me to where my tweet was two-sided?  I simply was reporting what is happening with TSA.  Nothing about how this happened, who to blame, or any other effects. And also reported that this is just now. We don't know what happens next.
@NateSilver538 Also, Dem presidential debates are just *five months* away.  Seems relevant.  (cc: @CillizzaCNN)
What does Julian Castro believe? (You may be asking.)  This piece lays it out, in specific. https://t.co/1xPzKH28JT
NOW Rep. Steve King: "I am an advocate for Western values"... "under any fair political definition I am simply 'an American nationalist'."  "This ... does not make me a white supremacist or white nationalist.  ... It is not about race."  "I regret the heartburn (this caused)."
NOW: Rep. Steve King on the House floor defending his words and blasting @nytimes ... CSPAN
@RubyFishbone Sincere thank you!  We are talking about it now in our daily planning meeting.  I had to pack a lot in last night, which is not ideal, but FYI I did not say there was "no effect" only that stories of mass sick-outs and officers quitting have been overblown, but concern is high.
As we reported last night, generally reports of TSA officers failing to show up en masse seem overstated for now - but concern is high that will become real v soon. See below. https://t.co/UT9qlL4MnE
THIS - a St. Louis reporting legend whom I was lucky enough to interview last year.   Congratulations @jmannies   (CC: @rachelwellford.) https://t.co/LKQR14EDpx

ICYMI.  Cc: @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani  @TheJusticeDept @StormyDaniels https://t.co/q6O4vqF1vB
This is a point... (thank you for sending). https://t.co/rplXWVTlRF
NOW: Watching video of POTUS at the border w/ customs officials, but they are pointing to some drugs and weapons found at *ports of entry*.    So a wall or barrier would not affect the smuggling of those things.
We are with right now.  As long as the president sticks where he is, it's a question of who cracks first/most:  Senate Republicans or House Democrats?
TODAY SO FAR: - POTUS and Dems now literally farther apart, as he goes to TX border and they talk about, some march w Fed workers in DC. - This is now certain to be the longest shutdown in US history.   (That tech happens Sat., but seems only a time-space shift cold avoid)
NOW:  our newshour crew ready for interview w Frosh Rep. Abigail Spanberger.  Qs? @ United States Capitol https://t.co/meaVwCkobU
@williamskentm I see what you did there.
@Yamiche @JudyWoodruff @sayakoq @NewsHour @IAmAmnaNawaz @amyewalter a delayed +1 and a delayed +1, noting that you *Judy* are faster than I am on social media. #AnotherAmazingThingAboutYou
SCHUMER: The president slammed the table, asked Speaker Pelosi if she would support his wall and when she said no, he walked out and said "we have nothing to talk about".
SEN ROBERTS: President Trump said if we can just stick this out maybe we get back to the $25 billion for DACA (four pillars) kind lf deal.
AT THE CAPITOL. Waiting as GOP lunch w POTUS is going long.   (note mass of press.) https://t.co/AYVczoNBiw
.@SpeakerPelosi just stopped on way out of news conf to address this - pointing to GOP Leader McCarthy’s office and telling press we should ask him what he thinks of the president’s “irresponsible” tweet about their mutual home state. https://t.co/ktr0e0XnYD
SCHUMER now: “we all want border security... but to hold these people hostage (fed employees behind him) - so wrong”
No exaggeration - this is the most clear and helpful look you will get at whether there is a border crisis... Highly recommend. From the great @IAmAmnaNawaz and @mattloff team. https://t.co/Sx3EC96bWt
@RoseKapol @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff @IAmAmnaNawaz @amyewalter @Yamiche Thank you!  That day was last night!
@Elenach @PBS @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff @Yamiche @amyewalter @IAmAmnaNawaz Wow this thread. Thank you to all of you for making our week!
NEW: @SpeakerPelosi spokesman tells me point blank that POTUS claim that the barrier “will be steel, at Democrats’ request” is *false*.  “You can say I said it’s false,” @Drew_Hammill responsed to me.
A difficult, ignored issue here is that as the president points out, women and children are those suffering most at the border. And some are trafficked or extorted.   But he is not addressing the largest group of people suffering - thise running from violence in their countries
TRUMP - the southern border is a problem that: - hurts jobs rate for minorities - leads to drug deaths, sex crimes and violent killings  - is a humanitarian “crisis of the heart and of the soul”
NOW: Rep. @RashidaTlaib now live on the CNN.
@matunos @NewsHour Pelosi has made it clear that she currently sees any impenetrable border barrier across the entire border as "immoral".
Full House of Reps is standing at silent attention, as Kirkpatrick recalls the attack on Giffords.
NOW: New (and former) Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick,D-Ariz., is with former Rep. Gabby Giffords on House floor commemorating attack on Giffords (who used to hold that seat).   Giffords is there, surrounded by colleagues.  For Dems this is a moment also about gun control.
@RepTjCox Please tweet any grill update, if there is one.
Also. Strange day. Sen. @BernieSanders just stopped @VP Pence to shake his hand.   They smiled, chatted quickly and the entire political spectrum became v confused.
SEN DEM #2 DURBIN now to reporters: The President does have power to build a wall using emergency powers “on a military installation”. “On a military installation”, he repeated.  Also said in theory the president could try to buy the border and declare it all an installation.
NOW: Senate swearing in new Florida Senator Rick Scott, R-FL.  His swearing in was delayed b/c he was finishing his old job (governor).
MCCONNELL summary: - He is not  happy Dems are threatening to delay/block non-shutdown legislation as long as the shutdown continues. - He will not bring any of the approps bills passed by the House to the floor.  He will only bring something that all sides have agreed upon.
McConnell is now pointing out the Democrats have supported physical barriers in the past.  This is an issue for them. Maj Leader Hoyer admitted to my qstn about this today that he may not have a gd answer for why they supported large fences in past but now oppose all barriers
McConnell Now: Is railing against Schumer's pledge to block/delay the Senate from moving forward on Syria-related legislation as long as the govnt is partially shutdown.
NOW: Senate in session. Watching for @Senatemajldr McConnell and Dem Leader @SenSchumer to speak.  #CSPAN2
@ericawerner @edokeefe @BernieSanders Hopefully to just one camera.
GOP pushback on emergency military dollars for a wall... https://t.co/WzYVZGMKpf
NOW: I think this is frosh Rep. Lucy McBath's first set of remarks on the floor, talking about her son Jordan's death and her push for greater gun control.
@AndyShain Helpful.
@DimitriSNovikov Payroll needs 3-4 days to process. So if gov reopens the week of that paycheck it should process. But we'll have to ask when we get closer.
As @RsterAM points out, it's not guaranteed that all fed workers will get back pay.  So the best way to put this is:  We now know fed workers will AT LEAST get a delay in pay.  And it is not yet clear when or if they will all be repaid.  (That's SOP, but not certain yet.)
@RsterAM Thanks Annette.  Did not mean to be inaccurate! Stand by...
THIS, from multiple gov. agency sources.  Today is the drop-dead date for the payroll process to start for Friday's paycheck.  SO. B/c there's no deal today, 800,000 fed workers WILL see their next paycheck delayed.   Question now is for how long.
Best Twitter factoid today so far --&gt; https://t.co/ILrnLI5IEc
BREAKING:  Pelosi and Schumer to personally deliver response (both, together) to Pres. Trump’s address tonight, from the Capitol.  A rare branches of government and political party dual debate of ideas, in prime time.
@Bakari_Sellers Wow so beautiful. Congratulations!!
@asheinin *switches to watch "Brewster's Millions"*
Segment worth watching: https://t.co/PXqIkfJKlz https://t.co/3OFhJas974
Here's the tweet from Pelosi... https://t.co/oI1ew2HTxA
Democrats Pelosi and Schumer just issued a statement telling networks they should get equal air time after the president's speech tomorrow.
SMH.  One team from SC is playing a team from the SEC and neither is actually SOUTH CAROLINA.  Yet again so not fun to watch the national championship.  cc: @asheinin   PS wow that was a great pass, though.
Also today, very bad news: https://t.co/S2MTlmZUdV
WHAT THIS WH CHART SAYS (the 3rd one), I believe:  - Numbers of single men crossing border are DOWN - The increase is ENTIRELY IN FAMILY UNITS  Raising questions of how those particular number support a wall? https://t.co/W1oUnYqCH2
@rayrichter @hari Thank you for such good wishes and thought!  Those are good prayers.
@hari Hey Hari, can you please let PBS (and our lawmakers I suppose) know that we need a week off from the news? Perhaps if we wound the clock back to just before Christmas/pre-shutdown?
@mscattie_e @TobaccoChick @JudyWoodruff This made my day. I’m all about the veggies and good fuel.  (Tho disclosure: not vegan. But pro-veggie and fruit. )
@robbywerner @JudyWoodruff Promise no cloning! Just tired body and liftetime of learning how to get around DC traffic as quickly as possible.
@sarajust @NewsHour I have the best boss.   This is a v v cool tweet.  #MamaIsDrinkingSomeWine
THIS. (Really)  To me from @Senatemajldr McConnell's office, on why he did not attend POTUS newser:   "He and Thune left when the meeting was over. He was unaware of the press avail but of course would have gone if asked,"
PRESIDENT TRUMP - this: I can declare a national emergency and use that power to build a wall without Congressional approval.  I am considering that but would prefer a negotiated resolution w Congress.   (Note: I paraphrased, accurate, but paraphrased.)
SHUTDOWN AND BORDER SECURITY NEGOTIATORS: over the weekend will be Pence, Kushner and Nielsen from the WH, Pence just said.
POTUS says meeting w Dems was “productive”, that he explained his concerns about vehicles crossing areas w no barrier and a about human traffickers.  (Dems exited earlier and did not paint meeting as productive.)
President Trump in Rose Garden now w VP Pence, House GOP Leader McCarthy.  But note - no Senate GOP Leader McConnell. https://t.co/gKUeTH9rCo
Apologies it’s now 2-3 min.
And we have been brought to Rose Garden, told 2 min until POTUS.
FROM DEM SOURCE FAMILIAR: at one point Pres, Trump did use the word “years” to describe how long he is willing to keep gov. shutdown going.
NOW: Pelosi, Dems coming to mics outside the WH
@TobaccoChick Yes, as my foloers know I usually hit 4p HUNGRY amd without.  So I’m learning.  A little.
(Glad I brought: gloves and flats. Keeping heels in the bag.  Wish I brought: socks. ) https://t.co/jVs9QOV4mG
At the WH: lots of speculation in press corps that POTUS speak in the Rose Garden but nothing announced yet. So, unclear.   Meanwhile, Shutdown Summit IIII now at 90 min. And still going.
@EvanMcS Is this shutdown related?
NOW: At the WH, thinking two things. 1. how long and contentious is the shutdown meeting happening inside going to be? 2. She deserves it but I and the world will be happy when @Yamiche is back from planned time off. https://t.co/Ny25QWKcJI
At her event, Pelosi stuck to the plan and focused on Dems’ bill (HR 1) to reform ethics/accountability.    She spoke then stepped out (she does have an 11:30 WH meeting). https://t.co/mB6UmdgET7
GOP LEADER McCarthy: Just blasted @SpeakerPelosi for not personally taking some kind of action against new Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s use of “m-f’er” to describe the president.   Meanwhile I’ve moved from ther to Pelosi event now...
NOW: House voted 241-190 to reopen most of shuttered government agencies, fund them for rest of year.  7 Republicans voted with Dems.  *resending to correct terrible typos*
Watching Lifetime's #SurvivingRKelly on TV while using laptop to watch Congress still not able to agree to fund government is not easy, but glad I'm doing it.
NOW: The House passed short-term funding for DHS until Feb. 239-192.  But no border wall money and no deal w/ Trump to sign it, so it's DOA in Senate.
Happening now! https://t.co/X8F8y9z3m6
Pelosi about to speak to media...
ICYMI: The Senate Judiciary Committee Will now include two GOP women: Joni Ernst and Marsha Blackburn.   Cc: SCOTUS watchers
@JaneGummyof3 @AllisonMY @CharlesAlden2 @MarilynLouise5 @ChuckGrassley So this always happens with this! The first person in line is the first person in line, not the president themselves.  So the line goes: 1. Pence 2. Pelosi 3. Grassley.
This just happened ... @vp came and spoke to a few of us at the Capitol immediate outside new @SpeakerPelosi’s office. https://t.co/dTSnnytXUW
This just happened... https://t.co/niHASRv7Hk
So two things just happened...
@kmckean1 @shatash96 @kazweida @ChuckGrassley @NancyPelosi See above.
Again, the very happy California Democratic delegation today... https://t.co/yLXRDcabVU
Just came from watching the entire California Dem delegation line up, with @RepJuanVargas repeatedly leading "Cal-i-forn-ia, here we come!" as they went to follow Pelosi into the chamber.  A very merry group.
On GOP side of House chamber today there are more female children of members than there are female members of Congress.
Amazing.    The House chamber is packed and also contains many children, small babies, yet the only fidgeting or noise out of turn was a “boo” from GOP side when Massie voted for Jordan.
Waiting to see if new NJ Rep. Andy Kim goes Pelosi, present or other.
Maine's Jared Golden votes for Cheri Bustos.
Sidenote: the girl in purple dress is winning.
This is interesting. Longtime Nashville-area rep. here, did not vote for Pelosi. https://t.co/OO61KqHj07
Class act here.  Departing/now former top staffer for @SpeakerRyan----&gt; https://t.co/Xa5Zp9YrPx
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE VOTE: Starting now.  This goes one-by-one, a roll call.  It will take some time. (An hour plus...)
JUST HAPPENED: Sen. @ChuckGrassley is now third in line to be president.  (He's the new President Pro Tem of the Senate.)
Yes!! Watch! These are the people who will determine our nation's future. https://t.co/DGDzeMru5B
They do this differently.  SENATE: Swears in new and reelected members first.  HOUSE: takes attendance, elects the Speaker of the House first.   Then the new speaker swears in the members.
NOW: First big moment of the new Congress. New House members using their vote cards for the first time - to record that they are present.
NOW: House clerk notes that NC's 9th district remains in dispute and she has received no credentials to fill it.
Rep. Emanuel Cleaver begins 116th Congress with a prayer, that he says is in recognition of "unbridled optimism".
The 115th Congress has adjourned!
NEW CONGRESS minutes away everyone!
Among the largest crowds in the Longworth Office Building is the one surrounding incoming Rep. Abigail Spanberger and her office.  Constituents and we’ll-wishers poured in. https://t.co/noQbmBQ4Uz

@TheodoreBNolan @NewsHour @mattloff I appreciate this feedback and fear I will sound terrible asking this, but want to clarify this and get it right. Do you believe it is never correct to say "federal worker"? Even second reference, for example?  The terms generally are synonyms I thought.
@jzembik @LUnderwood630 And what was the caller's question?
Happening now: Torrent of goodbye emails from departing House GOP staffers.    A classic bittersweet day in DC. Democracy is functioning (transition of power) and also not functioning (shutdown).
@riccimike @SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner @BrendanBuck Congratulations Mike.  Thanks for your work and response.
@asheinin #SEClogic also
Interesting.  Worth noting it's not clear if President Trump wants a barrier along the entire border. https://t.co/FcP6QShBw6
DEMOCRATS FUNDING PLAN: - Pass full-year appropriations for most agencies now in shutdown. Except DHS. - Pass short-term funding for DHS, with $1.3 B in border fencing and no $ for a wall.  It would fund the agency until Feb. 8.  GOP PLAN:  - DOA until Trump agrees.
@burgessev Please do.
POTUS nixed it after telling Durbin and Graham he was going to agree... (Graham had a line then about wondering which president he was taking to - the "Tuesday" president who agreed to the deal and the "Thursday" president who reversed course as a hard no.)
POTUS nixed the "four pillars" deal that including path to citizenship and at once point Schumer's offer of $25b for the wall... https://t.co/c8hwINnRHe

Super cool of all the Senators fans to wear shirts giving props to Ovi. cc: @mtill50
@DimitriSNovikov @washingtonweek @MickMulvaneyOMB Contractors are already losing pay and won't get paid back.  As for the 11th, yes, but some people are not taking the chance of showing up to surgery and not having money to pay for it. So they are delaying to when they think shutdown more likely to be over.
@MikeDelullo2 @NewsHour Thanks for the comment but I don't understand what exactly is wrong in the chart?
@bigBigBANGfan I'm hoping to work it into a segment I'm writing for Monday. Good point.
@rickvoshell I deeply appreciate that. I think it's really important to highlight all sides and remember how many people share his views.  Feel that way about all sides of divide now.
Tweak here. I spoke with people who have delayed surgeries and have delayed closing on homes.  I did not speak to anyone who missed a mortgage payment, but believe I said that point will be coming should the shutdown continue a few more weeks.   cc: @washingtonweek https://t.co/GAhDlchPCE

@OMETA16 @lcsboyz @NewsHour @Yamiche Thanks! And you do get points for paying attention to who's on what beat in general.
@lcsboyz @OMETA16 @NewsHour @Yamiche Basically I saw a pool report and tweeted about it.    Sometimes I tweet about court cases.  Sometimes about sports.  It has nothing to do w/ other reporters doing what they do.
@lcsboyz @OMETA16 I am hesitant for about 5000 reasons to reply to this. But for starters, no reporter at @NewsHour (so not me) is limited to covering/tweeting about just one building.  @Yamiche is a stellar teammate and I LOVE when she is able to come help *me* at the Capitol. Which does happen.
MEANWHILE at the WH:  - Trump has been in the Oval Office "past couple of hours" - "No plans as of now" for him to go to Mar-A-Lago   ... from Sarah Sanders to press pool.
SO YES https://t.co/jrUJj3CgVh
@joshgad So this will seem super weird b/c obviously we have never met, but that photo makes me think actually you could be a brother of Bobby Lopez (a friend, I'm not creeepy) (here).   That's all kinds of ethnicities crossing, but am I crazy? Sleep deprived? cc: @Lyrikris10

@JVinDC @derekahunter @WMALDC Hi fellow Star Trek fan (though I will fail any trivia contest), This is Lisa Desjardins from PBS NewsHour. I'm reaching out to fed workers about the shutdown -  looking for all perspectives, including pts you make. Would love to chat w/ you if possible. Won't take long.
@coliseumcrazy Huh.  Curious what region or part of world you grew up in, for me and those I knew it's definitely Irish "goodbye".  Maybe that's evolved...?
Well said Craig. https://t.co/jwdmXKhiU9

@AshLeeStrong Jealous even tho this also looks like you two are being removed from a snowy mountain disaster potential.
@SamhainNight @painter_nancy @PercyCueva6 @lrozen Also confirm that!!
@darbsnave Wellllll both of those were me taking liberties, having fun with speech.  Use with caution.
@painter_nancy @PercyCueva6 @lrozen I'm Irish. It's a thing. (But def. not limited to the Irish.)
@HoneyMSTN ?
SHUTDOWN - this is important:  - Senate gone until Weds. - So shutdown will go at least until then. - New Congress starts next Thurs.  - So likely shutdown goes even longer, into 2nd week of Jan.   And BTW, it looks like the entire 115th Congress is Irish-goodbyeing
Blink and you missed it.  Senate gaveled in just after 4p. Gaveled out for the weekend 4:03p.   But there are no jet fumes, because no one is here to leave.
CONFIRMED: SHUTDOWN WILL GO INTO NEXT WEEK, AT LEAST.  House GOP aide confirms no votes tomorrow or this weekend.   ("No votes this week" = none "this calendar week" = includes Sat. and Sunday, the aide confirmed.)
NO VOTES THIS WEEK, says House GOP leadership.   Shutdown will continue.  (If you went with the "over" in my 2:30p over/under on this - you win.)
SHUTDOWN UPDATE: There is no update.   There are no signs of life, or negotiations, in the negotiations.  And, barring a wild twist, I'm setting the over/under on an announcement of no votes tomorrow at 2:30 p ET.
@KazeSkyz @Bgmac17270 Well that is kind of you too. Thank you. These are testing times. Everyone getting too defensive and not just listening/talking, I think.  Why I like my job - it's a big responsibility but ultimate chance to listen.
@KazeSkyz @Bgmac17270 I definitely appreciate that sadly many Americans don't trust the media and have a hard time believing that many of us really are trying to get to the truth, to pursue all stories and report on it.  And especially cover what is ignored (whether on right or left.) But I am.
@KazeSkyz @Bgmac17270 Sincerely glad you are holding media accountable. But I've been writing many people. And I'm simply asking questions, verifying and checking anecdotes.  This is not my reporting, this is my researching. I've reached out to a wide variety of people.  Also I do not work for CNN.
@KazeSkyz @Bgmac17270 Hi. Listen I understand why anyone might qstn any institution now, especially the mass media.  And I do think the media, bc humans, can be blind to its own bias. And I do think many outlets can skew left.   But not sure why you think I have a libl agenda. Work v hard for balance.
@pookynpoops Answer = fewer characters.
Right now, no. Not close.  And House may be even tougher. https://t.co/4kVFukXbbZ
@DC_COtransplant Hello @DC_CO... This is Lisa Desjardins from the PBS NewsHour as a saver and nat park lover myself, let me say - if not too blunt - that sucks.   I'm trying to talk to as many folks affected by this as possible - could we chat? For starters, could you folo me so we can DM?
@OrlandoJonesGWs Um obviously that's "Or-Lando" in quotes I figure.  But I like it.
@OrlandoJonesGWs Hello Orlando, This is Lisa from PBS and I'm looking for thoughtful folks affected by the shutdown.  Can you follow me so we can DM? I'm not heavy-handed, but want to get as much perspective as possible... get out stories about what is happening/not happening.
@ed_dc2 Hi Elizabeth,  My name is Lisa Desjardins and I'm looking for interesting thoughts and experiences on the shutdown. I'm a saver too so your tweet stood out.  Could we talk? Can you folo me so we can DM?
@darbsnave @NewsHour Exactly!
@AworkFh @NewsHour Call it a fanciful turn of phrase.  I knew it at the time.
@jbendery @NewsHour Not as long as this shutdown. Thankfully. Though, I think I watched "Devil Wears Prada" alone at least four times, whilst researching.
CHART: I spreadsheeted every gov shutdown since 1977. Why they happened. How long. And whether they affected anyone.    (Spoiler: v few actually sent fed workers home.)   Story: https://t.co/5cVuoWSG6A  Chart: https://t.co/fGCA22BWue  cc: @NewsHour
@JohnAntonelli1 @NewsHour Thank you!! Can we talk on the phone? I prefer human contact.  If not, then folo me so we can DM or email.  Interested in what agency you are connected w/ and how and what this shutdown does/does not mean for you? And is this any different than past shutdowns? The same?
NEW: From Senior House Aide - House GOP just told members NO VOTES expected tomorrow.  Meaning, yes, the shutdown will continue tomorrow. (If not longer... we will see.)
REQUEST: Fed Workers, Families, Contractors: please folo me or tweet at me if willing to share your thoughts.    Would love to talk, want as much sense of how this feels to folks - of any view - as possible.  Had really good convos so far.  And have drawn some kitties (below). https://t.co/fDzldS8ifu
SHUTDOWN Like This: I'm reporting on the shutdown and sharing desk with with a well-behaved toddler whose fed daycare shut down today. (Her dad is NewsHour colleague in our big newsroom a few feet away.) #ShutdownStories https://t.co/EpcTLSqs4N
@DocRepublican @Ancient_Scout Yes!
@arrowt I completely understand!  Please consider me if you decide you do want to talk on or off record.  My email is ldesjardins@newshour.org.  And would you mind if I could at least check in (not for attribution to start until you agree otherwise) next week, should this keep going?
@jlmaz @jenwvurx @realDonaldTrump Wow thanks for that Jlmaz!
@direwolfepc I'm afraid that's not ringing bells at the moment but he sounds like an interesting man.
@shamapoo Hi Maria,  My name is Lisa and I'm a reporter for PBS hoping to connect w/ federal families. Could you folo me so we could DM?

@jenwvurx @realDonaldTrump Hi Jen, There is no other word to use except to say that really sucks.  I'm sorry.  Could you folo me so we could DM? I'm a reporter hoping to talk to folks affected.  Can explain but would not be intrusive.
@Ancient_Scout Hello Daniel,  That is terrible. Could you folo me so we could DM? I'm a reporter hoping to talk to folks affected.  Can explain but would not be intrusive. Suspect you are overwhelmed with response but want to see if we can connect, want to know more about your story.
@HurricanePotty Hello Hurricane, first thank you for tweeting this. Second, I have a toddler and no baby and I don't know how anyone with both does it. Third, could you folo me so we could DM? I'm a reporter hoping to talk to folks affected.  Can explain but would not be intrusive.
@rider33414 That is a great-looking cat.
@betsygriebs @JudyWoodruff @NewsHour What a great dog!!
BORDER CRISIS: Shortly after midnight this am, an 8-year-old migrant who was in US customs and border prtctn custody yesterday died at a NM hospital.  The hospital diagnosed a fever yesterday and then released the child w/ a prescription for antibiotics.  https://t.co/HM6a3oep0F
Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone!!  We are rolling hard core happy two-year-old style today.    Sincere thanks for the folos, tweets, tips and thoughts all this year. https://t.co/vUX53JyBGP
@rperly1 Nooo!  Also mockery.  (Well meant.)
Current Senate Republican #2 (who has said this is now b/t the WH and Dems.) --&gt; https://t.co/G4aVvfLnqo
Shutdown words so far this Christmas.  Trump: Told reporters that federal workers want to stay out until he gets his wall money. Also sd "wall or barriers whatever you want to call it."  Pelosi: told USA Today, meanwhile, "now he's down to, I think, a beaded curtain or somthing."
@SKastenbaum @ChuckGrassley This is a good question.
@W4DFS Second favorite tweet of this Xmas!! Exactly.
@tjohnson1960 @tamarakeithNPR Merry Christmas!!  On the rest, good q for @SenSchumer and @TeamPelosi
Yes. Favorite tweet of Xmas so far, seeing @ChuckGrassley's current (?) vacuum. Apparently named "Beth". https://t.co/ZWlZMSm2i4
SCHUMER SPOX statement says it all: "The Vice President came in for a discussion and made an offer. Unfortunately, we’re still very far apart."
MERRY SHUTDOWN!   1. No senate votes until Thursday now so shutdown will go at least that long. 2. But at least staff at Capitol will not have to waste time waiting for deal that is not happening  3. Next tweet, Schumer spox sums it up well....
LATEST: Pres Trump lunched w members of Congress who share his view on the wall and, except for Sen. Shelby, seem unlikely to compromise.  Sen Schumer insisted the government will not reopen unless Trump backs off his wall. And there is buzz that Pence may be coming to the Cap.
Attn: @lizzieohreally, icymi. https://t.co/MJiCYjoUYd
SCHUMER: is now doubling down. On Senate floor, said that if the president wants to reopen government, he must abandon the wall.
@thetoyman1 @ellisonbarber Is it clear this is w members of congress ?
MCCONNELL: just told us he is not part of any lunch at the White House.  (See POTUS tweet about a lunch on "border security")
Where we are: - no signs of where negotiations are, if they are, at the moment - House and Senate are in at noon.  Though unclear what that means. (Gavel in and out? Gavel in and wait? Gavel in and do something?) - and Americans abroad seeing things like this (h/t @jamiedupree) https://t.co/RxIVxv39LH
This woman amazes.  And is so right.  PS Jane's latest pieces about the tragedy and long work to recover in Iraq are incredible...  https://t.co/n1GR6t0iDs  and https://t.co/9pMCGftbZC  And Jane, you happen to be beautiful too. https://t.co/J7IcCj1eEs
@JakeSherman I owe you a drink. Or something.

@cliffschecter @mshotspot70_kc Jim Bunning! = original Senate Cranky Caucus member.
@RosLehtinen @WestPoint_USMA Member of Congress who voted today, apparently now on airplane. FYI.  #ShutdownGonnaBeAMinute?
@andreachiou 1976 but I think it is also code for "we don't know how/don't have ability to quickly search all the records from before 1870, so who knows? They had wacky times then too."
FYI. This *year* is the first in modern history when any shutdown has happened with one party in control of the WH, H and Senate.  *Corrects previous overly-broad tweet
Folks. Deleting this and resending. B/c @seungminkim just was a good friend and slapped me in the face with facts.
@seungminkim I need to shut down my laptop.   yes. gah. not even enough brain power to formulate lame excuse.  but thank you.
+1 Sense of resignation - from "meh" to punchdrunk-jokey was omnipresent.  The fact that a process question on a DOA bill was the main topic of talks today said everything. https://t.co/PlCnh8MQV1
@QQQQDJT I think some in GOP are afraid  of Trump in sense that he connects w his voters much better than they do. Not sure they are as nervous about Coulter.  More him.  But if he cares about Coulter than it does splash down.
@MDayne @NewsHour Good point. Just want to make ppl think I do.
As we have said... shutdown coming.   Senate has adjourned.
At the Capitol - talk now tuning to whether Congress leaves until Weds.  That's where we are.  At this moment.
WHERE WE ARE: Sources in both chambers in both parties confirm a shutdown is expected.  It is not clear what a possible des would even look like.   But Senate has said it will not vote until there is such a deal.
(Um @Newshour viewers, heads up that my makeup kit is on the other side of the Capitol and I didn't want to leave to miss Senate action. Apologies if my attempt at best-as-I-can falls short in live shot coming up in a few minutes.)
SCHUMER is on the floor.
THIS. A shutdown is happening.  (And also McCarthy a little in front here, Senate has not closed its vote on House bill yet.) https://t.co/7SPCqGVz3u
Shutdown more and more likely... https://t.co/aj9EcSyOf8
As we wait, McConnell is wearing his "Senate Cranky Coalition" button as he prepares to speak.  (That's the red button you see.)
HEADS UP: @SenMajLdr seems to be ready to speak on Senate floor.
SPOTTED: @VP on Senate floor.   Corner of CSPAN2 shot if you are watching.
Except he actually went to the House side.  And I see reporting that he is on way back.  Smh at myself. https://t.co/Icvw5ePEsm
@GoetheChris Wow. thanks. Nope.  Groucho had  it right.
@sarahdwire @seungminkim My mother-in-law may have to settle for a temporary escort badge to the Capitol.  (Yes Twitter, joking. But I may actually have to bring my two-year-old up here if working next week. BE WARNED all.)
Just guessing here.  Possible paths forward?:  - One-week CR. - Five-day CR.
Gah. *us* in press corps I meant of course.
Pence has exited the building. https://t.co/NugC5bN8JI
NOW: is in press corps waiting as Pence meets w Schumer in Schumer's office.  No photos allowed of the hall (lots of law enforcement and marble).  So here is a photo of reporters' feet. https://t.co/LPDSRL56UB
SENATE HOLD UP: remains senators returning.  Cornyn told us Sens Risch and Tester are on the same flight and due to land around 3p ET.   Said not clear if current vote (motion to proceed) makes it. "I hope so".  Big picture, Cornyn sd this is bt Schumer, Pelosi and POTUS now.
CORNYN on state of play: at some point people around here want to go home and they get serious about working out a solution.  We're not there yet.
@PerniciousZ You get points for writing "flair"
MCCONNELL literally has a button that says "Senate Cranky Coalition".  And he stopped to show us, saying it is the unanimous sentiment of Senate Republicans. https://t.co/gAq8xdASrv
NEW from our @SaherMKhan.    Approps Chair Shelby told reporters: - Without some big intervention we are heading to a shutdown - At meeting they talked about several bills, including $1.6 b for border security. - Says that may be a starting pt, but unclear if Trump would ok it.
Correction (tips hat to @jamiedupree )!  This vote needs a *majority*.    Not necessarily 50.  (We have absences, clearly.)
KEY MOMENT What's happening with this Senate vote?  - This is motion to take up the House funding bill - Needs 50 votes  (+Pence) - IF passes, next vote would need 60. - GOP senators deciding if better to vote this down now and send message to House.  Or let it die on next vote.
Corker two things he just said: - sounds like the WH meeting was "colorful" - it does feel like this will end in a shutdown.
Shutdown, view now from outside the Senate? Does not look good.
COLLINS: did not comment after meeting.  Did tell me the meeting was a full hour and a half.
PS Exceedingly rare for McConnell to stop and talk to reporters. At all.  Much less with several sentences on issue in play.
McConnell: said talks continue, they are looking for a way forward and they will begin the process of voting on the House bill.   He is speaking on floor in minutes.
HEADS UP: just told @SenMajLdr McConnell will speak on senate floor shortly.
Corker: this is the tyranny of two talk radio hosts.
NOW:  @SenAlexander says he is an absolute NO to the nuclear option.  "I want to put a stop to this practice of the Senate breaking its rules to change its rules."  With Hatch and (seems) Rubio, that means the votes are not there. Won't happen.  cc: @realDonaldTrump @PressSec
HAPPENING NOW: Key GOP senators are still on their way *back* to Washington and will miss the 10:30 WH meeting.
@DoctrBenway Yes. That is what I meant. There is a real lack of rationality throughout Washington at the moment.
@DoctrBenway Oh gosh I think you misunderstand me.  Absolutely it is real.  Just the idea that he is meeting with senators while many are gone is at least odd.  Apologies that came across incorrectly or as if I was overly casual!
YES. CALL OUT. We need carolers at the Capitol.  To save us all. https://t.co/7hjgDllZui
So tempted to write "HAHAHAHAHA" to everything now right now. https://t.co/wrbZasVujc
RE: Going Nuclear.  1. McConnell has made it clear he opposes this in his soul - that he sees it as a grievous mistake that threatens the Senate itself. 2. He would need a majority of Senators to vote to make that move. (Likely a vote to overrule the parliamentarian.)
FOR EARLY RISERS, here's where we are:  The Senate won't take up the House-passed CR (w/ wall $) until after noon at the earliest.  But 1. McConnell's office warns that all senators must agree for that vote to happen quickly. And 2. If that does happen, it seems likely to fail.
For the 2019 radar - perhaps the two of the best strategy/policy/message people  of each House party start a back-and-forth as Mark Walker takes on Pelosi and her team quickly fires back. https://t.co/sWZHrzsm4z
This is a remarkable statement from McConnell re: Mattis. https://t.co/mYX8QRDkRs
@StevenTDennis Beautiful.  Go home Steve.
Reading now. https://t.co/LUIaU6D74V
Best tweet of this tornado-at-a-garbage-dump day. https://t.co/YGaRi2U4Sz
@sarahnferris Suspect the DCCC has flagged this tweet.
@JaredRizzi I had that entire album on constant repeat at one point.
How each member voted on the House GOP CR.  https://t.co/bh7Fm2XSQI
@LaurieLleclair None! https://t.co/bh7Fm2XSQI
TWO INTERPRETATIONS OF THIS HOUSE VOTE:  1. House GOP is uniting behind the president OR 2. House GOP knows this bill will not pass the Senate and will not become law. But voting against it will hurt them politically short term. So it's a yes that won't matter.
NOW: House GOP passes its funding bill easily, by by large margin. 217-185.  Almost entirely partisan vote. But that's noteworthy when consider all the Republicans that have doubts about the wall. (Or have told us they have doubts.)
There are not enough outstanding Dem votes to overcome the GOP margin on the House CR right now.
@seungminkim It does. They are 13 votes from the number that would have won the Rules vote a couple of hours ago.
HOUSE VOTE NOW: Majority is somewhere around 201 votes right now.  (Based on the rules vote a couple of hours ago.)
NOW: House voting on H. GOP funding bill that contains $5.7 b for border construction.  (They call it a "wall", I'm still sorting out what it is exactly.)  WATCH: https://t.co/Co1JXiYYNh
The words I heard the most from members and staff in Congress today tell the story: - "steel slats" (the new GOP words for "wall") and  - s*!t show
SCHUMER: this week was one of the most chaotic weeks in American government.
SHUTDOWN WHAT NEXT?: Schumer says the House bill (w/ wall $) will fail in the Senate tomorrow and then it will be up to the House to decide whether to take the Senate deal (w/ no new wall $).
SCHUMER: President Trump is plunging the country into chaos. The stock market is down, Sec Mattis is resigning.  ... And now Pres. Trump is throwing a temper tantrum.
PELOSI: "somehow or other the president of the United States prefers to shut government down."
WHERE WE ARE: - House getting ready for vote later on bill w $5b in wall funding.  - McCarthy reportedly told FOX they have the votes. - Sen will have to vote again, tomorrow, but very unclear it has the votes for House plan. - Dem ldr sources: House bill is the Wall, so no.
@jamiedupree Yep! Sorting out why the 0.7 - Sessions said he didn't know. (And apologized for not knowing.)
Text of new House CR, seems to be this here: https://t.co/LnyUOEeCvp
BREAKING - What H GOP will vote on (per Rules Chair Sessions): - funding thru Feb 8 - Flood, VAWA - $5.7 b for "wall funding" - $8.7 b for disaster funding. (Incl fires.)
At House Rules just three members on time: McGovern, Byrne and Cheney.   Press outnumbers them.  We may have to take some votes just to get things going here.
SEEMS GOOD TO POINT OUT: there is actually ALOT of time for House and Senate to sort this out before tomorrow night.   I'd actually give it just 20% chance of shutdown if it weren't for hard-to-predict Trump factor.
HERE WE GO: House Rules is meeting at 3:45.  (And just two of us in line now - come and join!)  This will tell how, and how fast, GOP plans to have next CR vote.
WHERE WE ARE: - House GOP has 1 plan: CR w $5b for border security (important to see lang to see what that means). - Not clear they have the votes - Not clear what happens if it passes. (Senate could balk) - Also not clear what happens if it fails. (POTUS said won't sign Sen CR)
THIS is helpful, possibly.  GOP Rep. Mark Walker just answered my q about language saying they are pushing for $5b as in DHS Approps.  Meaning physical barrier or fencing or technology.
OTHER PROBLEM: GOP Sen. Pat Roberts: juts mentioned to me that it's not clear how many senators are still in town.
NOW: waiting for @SpeakerRyan at the Capitol. https://t.co/GGYdYY7Mb4
PROBLEM: The president will not sign the bill that has the Senate votes. The House may not have the votes for the bill the president wants. And the Senate definitely does not have the votes for it.
!'SPEAKER RYAN NOW: the president will not sign the Senate CR Bc of border security. !!!
DEMS SAY DEFINITELY NOT to Border-Wall-for-NYC-Tunnel idea that some H conservatives were hoping could happen.   Multiple Dem leadership sources from all over confirm (and Jerry Nadler told me on record), saying not remotely a chance they go for that.
GRAHAM: I don't want to talk any more about who loves the troops, we all love the troops.   (Cc: @realDonaldTrump, that seemed directed at you.)
QUITE A DAY FOR THE GOP.  NOW, as House Repubs, the president are at the WH negotiating w themselves over a possible shutdown.... GOP Sen. @LindseyGrahamSC and two top-ranking Dems are at Capitol openly challenging Pres. Trumps plan to pull out of Syria. https://t.co/HWz0CROXJP
@StefanTurk Cc: @realDonaldTrump
NYC GATEWAY TUNNEL for BORDER WALL? More:   To me, NY Dem - and incoming Judiciary Chairman -Jerry Nadler immediately indicated that deal would be a hard no for his side.  One of indications  of Dems feel they are in v strong position now.
BREAKING HERE: the Wall for the Gateway Tunnel? Top source tells key group of House Repubs want GOP to make offer to Dems - they agree to wall money and WH/GOP funds Gateway. (Key project for Schumer and Dems in New York.)  Obviously v v fluid now, but this is serious idea.
SCALISE: said convos are about the wall. "We want to get the wall funded."
SCALISE (soon to be #2 in House GOP) to a few of us now: We are still having conversations w out members and the president about the CR.
BREAKING: Long day, fast vote (relatively).  Funding bill goes to House now. https://t.co/nLkdC2VPcK
... As other GOP leaders are thinking - if Trump *doesn't* sign there will be major fallout. https://t.co/BIO7ioexgO
CORKER NOW: says he is going to the WH to talk Syria at 3:30. Also: - No one in Senate was notified until this am - But Corker says he is more worried that it also appears there was no "interagency" communication. (Possible meaning: comms w the Pentagon from the WH.)
Dems on @SpeakerRyan's legacy?  Hoyer to me asking him: "(Ryan) has decent instincts. ... But this has been one of, if not the, most closed Congresses in history and one of the most fiscally irresponsible Congresses in history.  Maybe the most irresponsible."
.@SpeakerRyan: "The state of politics is another question. And that's one that I don't have an answer for."
Now, @SpeakerRyan: "The people have spoken and soon the House will (be in) the care of a new majority. And what I know will be a spirited Republican minority. I wish our next leaders well."
BUT INTERESTING: That @SpeakerRyan started his farewell with focus on a key moment - the moment he was told he was chosen as the VP pick in 2012.    Mentioned that he did not want to be speaker but has not talked about that moment or taking the speakership in same way yet.
RYAN's farewell is so far about gratitude: "From the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you all."
Necessary disclosure - I'm having trouble with my like/unlikes at the moment. Mistakenly hit two "likes" as I was trying to open threads.  Now having trouble unliking. Gah.
IN MINUTES: @SpeakerRyan  to give farewell address at Library of Congress.  His website is streaming it here - https://t.co/DVDYzmklKp
PRESS CORPS DIVIDED, closely:  Cap Hill broadcasters themselves have a rare run-off election today for the exec. committee.  (A big deal - determines credentials, fights for access/rules. )  ALL PAPER, in-person ballots.  And one awesome old wooden ballot box. https://t.co/FCdmztO7mM
Thread.  Lindsey Graham strongly opposing Trump's reported plan to withdraw from Syria. https://t.co/RxFulqy1YI
SHUTDOWN - where are we?:  - @senatemajldr McConnell just said a CR to keep agencies running through Feb. 8 will be introduced in next few hours.  BUT - GOP senators, sources still note that the president could change his mind again.
RIP Penny Marshall.    One hell of joint birthday party it's gonna be up there with Carrie next October.  It's a lot less of place down here w/out you both.  Cc: @TexasTribAbby, @Shawna

@DanTeston77 @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff We reported that separately I believe. It was not part of the farm bill, but part of the rule for the farm bill. (though I get that that distinction is debatable.)
One reason I love covering the Farm Bill debate: among the undercovered --&gt; rural America. https://t.co/K7emzB1HzT
@DJX7734 @DJohnstonX @NewsHour @Yamiche Thank you, that means a great deal.
@DJohnstonX @NewsHour Absolutely hear your points.  I should have conveyed this is among the smallest monetary disagreements leading up to a potential shutdown in modern history.  Which is fair, I think. But your points are still understood and appreciated.
HOYER to NewsHour: I think we'll agree to increase the (border security) budget, but not the wall.   Full interview tonight w @JudyWoodruff on the show tonight!
@frankences @BillWeirCNN @VP @tedbarrettcnn I actually don't know any robots (I don't think) but feel certain the answer is no.
WHO ELSE is arguing, beside the president, that $3.4 billion is worth shutting down a quarter of government?  So far @LindseyGrahamSC is only other voice I've heard say that.  And he's saying it loudly.
Me to @Vp: "What did you think of that meeting?"  Smiles.  I repeat qstn.  Pence: "it was a good discussion".  CNN's @tedbarrettcnn: was the atmosphere the seem in the private portion?   Pence: "it was very candid".
NOW: @vp Pence on his way to Hill to lunch w GOP senators.
GOP APPROPS CHAIR SHELBY when asked about President Trump saying he'd be proud to shut down the gov: "I've never said that, I've always said I want to keep government open."
GOP SEN. THUNE to us reporters re wth just happened: "I assume we'll find out more - as we usually do - in the aftermath of the meeting."
@MEPFuller Esp. as they prepare to pivot back to being deficit hawks in the minority.
NOT POPULAR, I BET: But I think that meeting actually makes a shutdown less likely.    Each side got the base points they wanted, big time, right there.
So much happening in this moment. https://t.co/vwdLmJ3Eek
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE: Trump is taking on another rule of modern DC politics - don't get blamed for a government shutdown.  Instead he's indicating that blame could help him.  Which has not worked out for others. But Trump has always won where others lost.
Points to Mike Pence for the @VP no-visible-opinion face.
Wow. This is everything in one face-off in the Oval.
FYI: It is NOT clear that House Republicans have the votes to pass $5 billion in funding for a border wall.  They have not taken that vote and Ryan did not address it directly when asked today.
Pelosi: We must avoid a Trump shutdown.  Trump: (interrupts - what?)  Pelosi: you have the Republican votes...  Trump: not in the Senate.  (Repeat 4x, each side.)
NOW: Vid of Trump and Dem leaders apparently duking it out in public (in front of cameras) is rolling.
WHERE WE ARE: - Major bipartisan criminal justice reform deal now moving in Senate. - 800-pg bipartisan Farm Bill moving in the House. - Senate about to move on bipartisan Saudi Arabia measures - --&gt;No shutdown talk at Capitol, Pres. Trump only voice at moment saying he wants one
@cspan on CSPAN 1? 3?
THE COMPROMISE FARM BILL has posted.  Read about it here: https://t.co/OtA7cBAT4U
Also - House committee chairman https://t.co/zoM2jg4Lfy
OVER/UNDER? Will a shutdown deal be announced before or after Weds. Dec. 19?  Place your bets.
Thoughts on the over/under date is for a shutdown deal to be announced?   (Funding goes until Dec. 21.)
Also is a good time for a misspelling. "Is *on*" Twitter I meant. https://t.co/YeOfqpvC1G
I am taking advantage of my belief that no one is one Twitter right now to brag that I just tied my husband in a pull-up contest
More on Manafort's contact w/ Trump administratoin this year. Mueller filing charges:  - Manafort texted approval for someone to talk to the admin. for him in May.
What Mueller says Manafort lied about: 1+2. Kilimnik. (see prev. tweet) 3. A wire-transfer 4. "Information pertinent to another DOJ investigation"&lt;----- 5. "Manafort's contact with Administration officials" &lt;----
What Mueller says Manafort lied about: 1.Interactions with and actions by Konstantin Kilimnik,. Who? Kilimnik is a former Ukraine associate of Manafort's, charged w/ obstruction and witness tampering (w/ Manafort). Some believe Kilimnik was Russian operative, he has denied this.
MUELLER ABOUT *MANAFORT*: - He spoke with investigators 12 times - He spoke to *grand jury* two times  More... (what the lies were)

Pretty remarkable.   Mueller team says Cohen was lying to them as recently as August.  That he only verbally cooperated Sept. 12.    That's three weeks after his guilty plea.

BREAKING: Guilty verdict in Charlottesville.  BC-US--APNewsAlert,16    CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Man who drove car into counterprotesters at white nationalist rally in Virginia convicted of first-degree murder.
It's definitely a Friday.    NOW:  CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Jury in trial of man who drove car into counterprotesters at white nationalist rally in Virginia has reached a verdict.
AND here's the Mueller filing on Cohen (corrects prev. bad link):   https://t.co/UoVZmU0MEm
Apologies! I had a bad CTL-V on the link.  Standby for correct link and deletion of this one.
@realAaronTaber Thank you - correcting fast as I can.
MUELLER FILING ON COHEN: - Cohen's crime was serious. Withheld information on Russia and lied about attempts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. - His lies to Congress were deliberate and premeditated. - He spoke with Trump about the Moscow Russia deal "well into the campaign"
COHEN FILING: - "Individual-1" appears 23 times. (That's Trump, Cohen said in court.)  - Says Cohen "made millions" as consultant marketing access to Trump in 2017, but his actual access was hollow.  - Says Cohen tld Trump about one illegal payout in a "secretly recorded meeting"
Let's do this.  Southern District of NY filing on Cohen has dropped: https://t.co/WlVos8d2EQ
COMEY: 1. I'll be back Dec. 17 for more testimony. 2. This could have been in open session. 3. You'll see we are talking about Hilary Clinton's emails, I'm not sure we needed to do that. But (I respect this body). 4. I like and respect Bill Barr.  I think he'll serve DOJ well.
"That is a finished case," Rep. Sheila @JacksonLeeTX18 tells reporters about the Clinton email investigation, after hearing Comey's testimony.
This thread is evidence of fact that there are good people in both parties who can/do respect and care about each other. (And the press.) https://t.co/3EZA3kKE7N

@stephaniekotuby @JudyWoodruff @IAmAmnaNawaz I hope it doesn't undermine this great power woman tweet to say that it made me tear up with gratitude.  So lovely and thank you. #StillPinchMyselfIWorkHere
@seanoduill @papermagazine @JudyWoodruff @IAmAmnaNawaz @NewsHour It's my reverse superhero look - I go nerdy when I try to get superpowers
@jamiedupree @pkcapitol I would take literal smoke signals as an upgrade from current situation.
@helchose @papermagazine @JudyWoodruff @IAmAmnaNawaz @NewsHour Plus Amna!
So @papermagazine just dropped a GIANT piece on TV journalism today. Worth the read  Note: all of us except the great @JudyWoodruff look to me like we are traumatized. (Tho we also look cool, b/c @papermagazine.)  https://t.co/k9jcHAioUf  CC: @IAmAmnaNawaz @NewsHour
No shutdown (for now) (tho let's be honest that another CR is likely)!  Senate just passed the House-passed CR.  Now goes to the President.  (Yes, there is that part still too.)
Wow. Lots of thoughts. Keep 'em coming.
@AdamCroley I see what you did there.
A rare subjective tweet from me on pending legislation.  It is ridiculous that Congress, with a sexual harassment policy that all parties agree is stacked overwhelmingly against victims/accusers - arguably punishes them - is still not acting on this issue. https://t.co/ewdmUDMNDA
NOW: Working on my Paul-Ryan-Legacy story.    Thoughts?

NOW: Schumer on Senate floor positioning for the shutdown negotiations.
See last line in particular. https://t.co/IP7jnC24hy
Good point here.  Though also good to point out that *47* members of the House are on this conference committee... https://t.co/sZfYGZLWuH
ANOTHER SQUEAKER. @VP Pence just broke a 49-49 tie to advance nomination of controversial judicial nom, Jonathan Kobes.  This after Sen. @JeffFlake withdrew his no vote, as a means to offset the absences of Sen. Inhofe, who would have been a yes.  Neither Flake nor Inhofe voted.
RE: FARR NOMINATION... https://t.co/0vwDCBw0Eg
Can't imagine how @RepCheri could do DCCC and softball both.   #CaucusOverTeam https://t.co/vnFCaK2wZn
UPDATE: McConnell's office points out to me correctly that the vote was *moved* and not *pulled*.    And they confirm need by OK Sen. Inhofe to get home for family reasons was a factor. (The margin is close - they need his vote.)  Vote is now pending for next week. https://t.co/herjMYJkdH
NEW: Senate GOP is pulling today's vote on judicial nominee Thomas Farr.  Am told (and seems clear) they do not have the votes for him to pass today.
@UncleBeebaw I keep hearing that...
@AndreasLupus True.
@KevinFloyd I feel like each scene was written by a different person.  And I'm not clear on who - if anyone - all those writers think we should like.   Maybe the dog?
@AndreasLupus Hmm. You've got me interested.
@TexasTribAbby Also I've never seen it.
@TexasTribAbby this is the correct response.
@eliza_jacobs hmm. you may have hooked me back in.  I was about to turn around and walk away.
@_therealmark_ My head - which has hurt for a lot of reasons this year - is hurting from the attempt.
I thought my job involved complicated and nonsensical plot lines.  But then, tonight, I tried to get into the new season of House of Cards.

BREAKING: from Dem source in room.   Pelosi yes: 203 No: 32 Blank: 3
BREAKING: @SenatorTimScott told our @SaherMKhan that he is UNDECIDED on his final vote on judicial nominee Thomas Farr.  (Love our @NewsHour team!)
WOW, under immense pressure, SC Sen. Tim Scott votes yes to move forward on judicial nominee, supporting the president and not civil rights groups who say the nominee has a history of supporting voter suppression, including with minorities.    Unclear if he is a yes on final
Heads up: Pompeo about to come to mics
MEANWHILE, it's even more intense on Senate side where press is gathering around senators (Coons is im this big bunch of people in photo) exiting Pompeio Saudi Arabia briefing.   Kudos to staffers trying to keep it same. (Tho the human staffer chain here is new.) https://t.co/wDLsMMgvx3
NOW: House Dems about to break from leadership elex, counting the votes for caucus chair. Expect results around 1p Rep Connelly tells me.   +McGovern told us they are "close" to a deal w problem solvers caucus on rules changes. https://t.co/8g3kjoZXkU
@rickvoshell @NewsHour Could not agree more! We are eager to cover it more... issue is if the bill moves. If it does, we will be on it.
HYDE-SMITH takes the lead in Mississippi.  But still just 4% of precincts are in.  It is Hyde-Smith 52%, Espy 48%.
I tip my hat to you sir.  (GA is voting on secretary of state and public service commission run-off races.) https://t.co/8LZM3tJGpi
@DCCajun @HowardMortman My guess is someone used the classic coat hanger trick w/ the American flag. (Fan it out using a coat hanger taped in back.)  But not the Mississippi flag, adding to the sense you are getting.
Mississippi:  With *one precinct* in, Espy is up 61.3% to Hyde-Smith 38.7%.   (Nice, fast work to that one precinct in Jasper County.)
Allow me to proclaim an end to the 2018 elections.  (At least the voting part.)
@HowardMortman Looks a lot like my house right now, both.
@JustinPGoodman @SenSchumer NewsHour got the nuance.   https://t.co/Z7zuxBvb31
@MorrillAli @NewsHour Thanks! I like it too.
@EmpatheticSr my snack twin, outdoing me.
FARM BILL LATEST:  *clarification* - Negotiators remain close to a deal - Sources tell me *House negotiators* have given ground on food stamps (no controversial reform) - Biggest issue left: forestry/wildfire rules - forest clearing. - That debate is now at leadership level https://t.co/ClGht15lHv
MUELLER PROTECTION:  - GOP Senate leaders are considering allowing a vote - Bill would limit who could fire Mueller and why - This is a gambit by Sen. Jeff Flake that may be working. (He's withholding his vote on  nominees.) - But it's future after that is rough.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM: - Big push, pivotal moment now - Sen. Scott told us he has 21 "firm" yes votes and 5 "soft" yesses from GOP.   - Graham says if they get GOP majority, then the bill should be able to pass. - Issuemay be in the House. Not many clear whip checks there.
FARM BILL LATEST: - Negotiators remain very close to a deal. - Sources tell me conservatives have given ground on food stamps (no controversial reform) - Biggest issue left:  forestry/wildfire rules - whether to allow more forest clearing. - That debate is now at leadership level
SHUTDOWN LATEST: - Sources in both parties on the Hill think it is very *unlikely*. - Idea is that Dems agree to &gt; $1.6 B in funding, but extract concessions they want.  - Meanwhile, non-scientific poll showed many reporters think a shutdown *is* likely.  (??)
UPDATES now coming, starting with snacks.  They are here. https://t.co/cSBXrRyPex
@NewsHour Snacks are here! Photo coming off thread.
CLASSIC CONGRESS. Easy things are not easy:   The Senate passed its resolution making Nov. 17, 2018 "National Adoption Day" last night. So, on Nov. 26, 2018.  https://t.co/zRNr2IOJwm…
@silverinpapio @NewsHour yes
NOW: have updates, will tweet on these stories I'm covering ( first must report to @NewsHour for our show): - Shutdown - Farm Bill - Crim. Justice Reform - Mueller protection - Saudi + US + arms sales - Saudi + US + Yemen - House leadership elex - Snack shortage at my desk
NOW at the Capitol: @vp Pence and Jared Kushner are having lunch w Senate Republicans.
Quick math: Hoyer has nearly *11 times* as many signatures as the Pelosi-No rebels. https://t.co/LmeMw7yZmO
THIS. To @Yamiche qstn about women, kids in line of fire of tear gas.  Trump admin: We don't target them, but "if women and children chose to insert themselves into a crowd that is attacking officers with rocks and bottles... (that is their responsibility)."
Asked again, how did you identify criminals in the caravan (by @Yamiche), Trump admin says it was "through Intel sources" and that is all they can say.  (Still no answer.)
How does the Trump administration know the number of criminals in the caravan?   Answer: That is law enforcement sensitive so we can't release that publicly.   = No answer.
KEY SENTENCE, now from DHS spokesman: The vast majority of the members of the caravan are coming for economic reasons and not for asylum.   Unclear how DHS knows this, or if it is assuming this.
NOW: DHS beginning *on-record* call with reporters about issues at the border.
@moguizhu You read my mind! Yes. Working on it TODAY.  The midterms knocked me off course.
And now there's this. https://t.co/gDKtlEg8GK  State of California has Dem TJ Cox w/ in 500 votes of GOP Rep. Valadao and this is from a CA politics blog... saying Cox may have pulled ahead. https://t.co/j0pY8WcN8d
And now this! https://t.co/doe2XM9DIu
MEANTIME, this.  Stabenow reportedly said today that how to handle firefighting is biggest hangup now. https://t.co/FNdRDkvBYR
Pres. Trump now: "We defend the borders of other nations, but we don't defend our borders properly. That has all changed with our election. We are sending a clear message to the caravan."
NOW, Cindy Hyde-Smith at Trump rally stressed she wants to protect Mississippi's "conservative values".
NOW: Pres. Trump beckons for @LindseyGrahamSC to take the stage in Mississippi.  (Reminder of current Graham-Trump relationship: They agree on the border but big time disagree on Saudi Arabia.)
Trump two minutes ago in Mississippi: Are you happy with what we are doing at the border? (Crowd: yes! build the wall!)  Trump 1 minute ago: But we need workers.    (Just has to be on merit, he adds.) (Did not add that asylum seekers do not have chance to show merit.)

In last few minutes:  1. MARCIA FUDGE is not running for speaker.  2. She IS going to chair a new/returned Elections Subcommittee.  3. And Nancy Pelosi's office kindly released Marcia Fudge's statement for her.
PRESIDENT TRUMP on IVANKA EMAILS:  Stressed that Ivanka did not delete emails and did not use  her own server.  He seems to overlook the use of private email in general... now saying the issues w/ Hilary Clinton emails were any deleted emails and use of a sep. server.
NOW. POTUS Statement: - He is standing w/ the Saudis - Crown Prince Muhammad has denied any involvment - And we "may never know" all of the facts around Khashogii's death. - Also Saudis are investing in the US Does not mention: CIA's reported conclusions
PELOSI INSURGENTS:  Have released their letter.  - 16 signatures - Pledging to vote against her in caucus and in January. - Includes 5 freshmen - Alll of those freshmen are men. No new Dem woman is on board  currently.  - 2 women signed: Reps. Sanchez and Rice.
Meadows initially restricted his chief of staff to having no contact w/ female staffers.  He later demoted him to "senior adviser", but at same salary  The chief of staff ultimately resigned.
Ethics Committee found that: - while Meadows quickly met w/ staff and expressed "zero tolerance" for harassment - And while both the Speaker's office and Rep. Gowdy's office (Meadows reached out) recommended firing the staffer  - Meadows did not fire the chief of staff.
Seems worthy of an RT. https://t.co/xoDPey1PMT
From the report: - Six female staffers said Meadows' chief of staff inappropriately touched them, was "handsy", touching sides, backs, shoulders dozens of times and pulling/ "playing" with ponytails. - Several said the chief of staff looked down their blouses or up their skirts.
NEW, BREAKING: bipartisan House Ethics Committee reproves (official for "scolds") Rep. Mark Meadows saying he "could have and should have done more"  after  he learned of allegations of sexual harassment by sev female employees about his senior advisor.  https://t.co/OujT9DGYG7
Complicated statement from @LindseyGrahamSC about goals as likely Judic. Chair:  "I will push for ...highly qualified conservative judges + aggressive oversight of the Department of Justice and FBI"  +   "I will continue to seek common sense, bipartisan solutions to major issues"
NOW: @Acosta walking back into White House press room with CNN DC chief @SamFeistCNN.
Grassley will now: - Be 3rd in line to the presidency (after Pence and the new Speaker.) - Run the committee overseeing Medicare and Medicaid. Which = nearly 40% of all health care spending in US. - AND taxes. - AND Social Security.
GRASSLEY MOVING TO FINANCE means: - Lindsey Graham to take over Judiciary (reminder: he vowed not to forget Dems' push on Kavanaugh accusations.) - Crapo stays at Banking. - Toomey not likely to become a committee chair (was in line for Banking if Crapo took Finance.)
@DanDanBeachMan Happy Friday! Not sure I understand the sarcasm... kind of what I was pointing out. Two opinionated sides are doing battle on Twitter.
For those following (or potentially voting on) the Pelosi speaker battle - see Twitter now. https://t.co/zBdY58juu2
@NateSilver538 You clearly have not been in DC for precipitation for a long time, Nate. No one cowers when water falls from the sky like my hometown.   (And I really don't know why.)
PELOSI WATCH - NEW: Progressive Caucus Chairs Jayapal and Pocan send out statement saying they  are "pleased" with their convo w/ Pelosi.  They mentioned commitments to making sure progressives are proportionally on big committees and that there are new leadership positions.
Am told Dems did introduce Maine's Jared Golden as a newly-elected rep.    His race was called while Dems were at or on way to this mtg.
What Dems are doing in this meeting. One member who just left says they are introducing each newly-elected member.  (Lots of applause for each.) "it's taking so long, so many of them!" (Quip)  They are also talking through new rules pkg.
@JHMcGinn @OMETA16 Exactly.
ZEN BREAK: as we wait for House Dems, all-time great Pbotographer Scotty Applewhite played some Willie Nelson ("Rainbow Connection") and we had a short hallway dance.  Love my Cap Hill colleagues. They make a strange political basement much better. (Photo post dance) https://t.co/4BBwFqwUd8
@ChandlerInVegas Thanks for the tweet.  You should watch our show! We did cover - in my story yesterday.
Also just happened: many House Dems weren't sure/forgot how to find the big room used for majority party meetings.    Lots of "where is the door?" "How do I get in?"
@nutmom123 I want to hear more -disappointment how?
PELOSI latest:  1. Rep Jayapal isnt saying where she is - told us she, Rep. Pocan are meeting w Pelosi later.  2. Rep. Richmond (CBC chair) said he is not anti-Pelosi but if Fudge runs he will likely support. Also said he spoke w Fudge today and she did not bring up Speaker run.
Kevin McCarthy is your new House GOP leader (starting Jan.)
McCarthy 159 Jordan 43
House GOP: Scalise wins his spot again unanimously (voice vote, no surprise). Still counting the McCarthy v Jordan race for leader.
Gwen was a phenomenal friend and mentor.  As Morgan said, we miss you everyday. https://t.co/FhcUnNjPVd
McCarthy v Jordan: they are tallying the votes in GOP conference now, heads up.
(thread) And another 4 Dems  in races that have not yet been called also said they would vote no on Pelosi.  Jared Golden, ME-2 Andy Kim, NJ-3 Anthony Brindisi, NY-22 Gil Cisneros, CA-39  Kim and Brindisi currently leading their races.
CHEAT SHEET. The 9 Dem Frosh who campaigned saying they'd oppose Pelosi.  Joe Cunningham, SC Jason Crow, CO Conor Lamb, PA Max Rose, NY Mikie Sherrill, NJ Jeff Van Drew, NJ Elissa Slotkin, MI Haley Stevens, MI Abigail Spanberger, VA  Another 23 frosh Dems left the door open.

ICYMI: Senate leadership is officially staying the same.  McConnell, Schumer both re-elected by their parties.
Indicted Congressmen batted 1000, FYI.  Reps. Chris Collins*, Duncan Hunter Jr and Sen. Bob Menendez* all have been declared winners of their races.   *Collins win was declared over the weekend.  **Menendez case ended in hung jury and acquittal, charges dropped.)
MIDTERMS 2018 - still happening. Uncalled right now are... - Dems ahead: NJ-03, NY-22, UT-04 and AZ Senate. - GOP ahead: CA-10, CA-39, CA-45, GA-07, ME-02, TX-23 and FL Senate.  Mississippi Senate is in a Nov. 27 runoff.
For any reporter who gets to ask POTUS a question:  Want to mention - before it's forgotten - that he said he has a plan to solve the abortion debate.   I at least want to hear more.
Pleasure talking through the news cyclone w/ @SmithInAmerica on @MiddayWYPR just now.  A British accent really is an unfair advantage.

THE NEW CONGRESS, BY PARTY: Our team spent days, built a lot of spreadsheets and found here is what our new government looks like in the US.  Also what a renegade dress sleeve looks like. (Please ignore that.) https://t.co/MrNI77rMUT
@HenryIsOurDog @NewsHour @IAmAmnaNawaz Not offended at all!! I completely agree.  And appreciate the feedback. It was a new dress that had never seen daylight before w/me, much less a camera.   It is not going to make any more appearances, fear not!
DOJ:  Estimates 97,000 people who entered the country illegally and came into U.S. custody were referred for a "credible fear" interview, meaning part of the asylum process.  DOJ now proposes that group cannot have access to the asylum process.
Here is the press release from DOJ.  https://t.co/YNj58QFa6Y https://t.co/4fgqkvREia

TRUMP'S MIDTERM WIN RATES.  (My math, based on where he campaigned in person in 2018*.)  Senate:  41% (5 of 12) House:  60% (12 of 20) H +S Combined: 53% (17 of 32)  *Does not count still-open races in any way.

NEW: Sheriff's dept. says weapon in mass shooting was a Glock hand gun and was the only weapon involved.   That assailant shot security guard outside, went inside and shot more security personnel inside.   Motive still unknown.
@JustKihl Man everything is a negotiation these days! But I'll take it.
Dear Universe, I need at least 20 minutes with no breaking news to do some reporting, get some research done and figure out how to cover all the breaking news.  Thank you.
UPDATE. In the last 36 hours: - *Key Supreme Court justice (RBG) hospitalized* - 12 killed in mass shooting - The attny general was fired - WH suspended CNN reporter - Dems take the House  - GOP increased their Senate majority  And it is barely a month since Brett Kavanaugh. https://t.co/WrQ601iVCw
KELLYANNE CONWAY NOW on FOX re @ACOSTA: It was a rough moment ... No young woman should have someone swiping away at them and grabbing a microphone from them.  Reminder: WH said it acted b/c Acosta "placed hands" on the aide. But vid shows only that Acosta refused to give up mic.
@KenGoodrich I nearly did include the decision to no longer refer to that campaign!  I blame Twitter - I couldn't fit it in w/in the character limit!!
In the last 36 hours: - 12 killed in mass shooting at a "college night" - The attorney general was fired - WH suspended a CNN reporter - Dems gained control of the House  - GOP increased their Senate majority  And it is barely a month since Brett Kavanaugh.
Susan Collins is concerned. https://t.co/L6BkxoatyJ
FEINSTEIN: is not calling for Whitaker's recusal, but instead that he make a public commitment to not interfering with the Mueller probe.   (Which is different than recusal.)
NOW: After telling @JudyWoodruff that Democrats cause is not impeachment, Pelosi is certainly opening the door to questions about the president breaking the law. https://t.co/Ps6NvOmifY
! https://t.co/mztQCA3dm6
REMINDER: which committee confirms AG nominees? It's the Judiciary Committee.  So Grassley, Feinstein and (most of) the players from Kavanaugh.
Really happening. Senate sources be ready for my call. Coming now. https://t.co/t6bV8Y5OS9
NOW:  FOX is playing President Trump's words praising Nancy Pelosi, saying he wants to work with her.  CNN is playing sound of the president berating reporters, calling them rude and terrible.   THING IS. Both things happened. Seems we have two countries and two presidents.
AGAIN GAH. NOW: The divide is glaring.  CNN Headline: Trump shames Republicans who lost  FOX Headline: Trump preaches bipartisanship after midterms.
@blakehfreeman Laugh, you're not alone. My husband definitely warns me that my metaphors need work.
Pelosi: "Sorry, I didn't watch his press conference"  = equivalent of swing at Trump's jaw
NOW. PELOSI's opening move after Democrats retook the House was to quote Ronald Reagan
TRUMP and NOW: Pelosi news conference.  And also welcome to the next two years of our lives.
PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST: - attacked losing Republicans - Asked Mike Pence to run w/ him again. - Said he'll decide on Sessions soon - No answer on birthright citizenship order - Called a qstn about race "racist". AND - Said he has an undisclosed solution for the abortion debate.
Worth reading, retweeting. https://t.co/ri4FUM2QOU
Significant for a few reasons. One is he ran against a strong Dem candidate in this swing (previously Dem) district. https://t.co/MBblTgaNgm
NOTE: "over the next week" is often a figurative phrase with President Trump.

V. PROUD to work w/ @Yamiche every day and esp now.  Handled a critical topic with nothing but professionalism just now.  No combat or looking for the spotlight, just a fair series of tough, important questions for the president.
Now: @Yamiche asks "some people say the Republican party is supporting white nationalists/white nationalist rhetoric, how do you respond?  Trump (points): that is a racist question.  Let me tell you I love our country, we have nationalists, globalists. That is so insulting.
YES @Yamiche !!!
Props to my colleague and friend @RichLatendresse for his smart questions about Trump's and US relationships with key nations and leaders.
Hmm. Watching the camera on the press corps now -- is like watching a bleacher full of people fighting to get Super Bowl tickets, or a random t-shirt, shot out by an air cannon.   And it is depressing (?) to know I would be fighting similarly to get recognized
TRUMP: If Democrats come up with an idea for tax cuts, a tax cut for the Middle Class, we can work together on that.
https://t.co/aATbwrcVUv
AND NOW.  Trump blames President Obama for Russia's annexation of Crimea, as reporter repeatedly reminds him that Russian Pres. Putin annexed Russia.   Trump repeatedly says simply it was on Obama's watch.
@JaredRizzi Nicely done to you both. @MattGertz
QUESTION: Farm bill...?  Trump Answer: The Democrats are blocking it - they don't want to give us the vote.  (Qk fact check - several key Senate Republicans are also not comfortable with the House/more conserv. Farm Bill.)
QUESTION: How will you push forward w/ the pro-life agenda?  THIS. Trump: It's a very tough issue for both sides. Its a very divisive, polarizing issue. (HERE) But there is a solution. I think I have it. Nobody else does. But I have it  (Next question. Reporter does not folo up.)
QUESTION: 2020 - will VP Pence be your running mate?  Trump: I haven't asked him, but I hope so. *Turns* "Mike will you be my running mate"?  Pence: indicates yes.  (Man this news conference.)
QUESTION: What lesson did you learn from looking at the results?  Trump: the results I've learned, people like me.  I just couldn't go everywhere (in the House) b/c there would be too many stops.   Mentions his visit to Andy Barr's district.
(THIS) QUESTION: The first 2 Muslim-American women were elected to Congress, one is veiled...  Trump: I dont understand the qstn  Qstn: Do you think this says something about a multicultural America?  Trump: I have the best numbers I've ever had w/ African-Ams + Hispanics
Question (April Ryan): about voter suppression I think. (couldn't hear).  Trump: Sit down, I didn't call on you. Will you please sit down.
Question: Will you consider removing Mr. Mueller from his position.  Trump: I could have removed him at any time. There was no collusion. This is very bad for our country.
Trump: I want protection for this country, we want security for this country.   Folo up Question: will you sign an order on birthright citizenship?  Trump: I'll answer that a little bit later.
Happening now. Open wrestling b/t Trump and the press.   Started when Jim @Acosta pushed to get in another question (after back and forth w Trump) about Russia + the president asked him to sit down, allow another question.  Acost kept on.  Ended, well, not sure it has ended yet.
TRUMP Q6: Do you demonize immigrants?  Answer: No, I don't demonize.  Folo: your campaign ad showed migrants climbing walls...  Trump: that's true, they weren't actors...  Folo: they are hundreds of miles away, that's not an invasion.  Trump: let me run the country, you run CNN.
TRUMP Q5:  Are you offering a my-way-or-highway scenario Dems?  A5: No.  Folo: that if they start investigating you... you can investigate them.  Answer: No (but) I can do that better than them.
Trump Q4: Your tax return? (Disclosure, took a qk phone call, missed wording)  Trump Answer: My tax returns are complicated. If I were finished w/ the audit, I would have an "open mind to it".  (Note, it is not clear which years' returns are still under audit.)
TRUMP Q3: Thoughts on Sessions?  Answer: Will decide on Sessions fate in about a week.
@jbendery Seems possible he meant Pink Floyd...?
TRUMP Q2: Are you preparted to shutdown goverment over the Wall during the lame duck (Dec.) session b/c it may be your last chance?  THIS. Trump Answer: Not necessarily. Dems agree on the wall. We have some elements now in place, it's getting tougher (to cross).
TRUMP'S ANSWR 1: I do think we can work together, (Dems) will come up w/ ideas on the environment, drug prices, health care.
TRUMP NEWS CONF.  QSTN 1 (really 3 qs): Do you believe given relationship b/t this WH and Dems that bipartisanship can happen? Will you have to compromise? Will you be facing investigations b/c of Dem takeover?
President Trump is in fact now making the argument that things might work better w/ Democrats in control of the House.    (Speaking about what couldn't get down uner GOP.)
What can Pres. Trump work with Dems on? He says:  - Infrastructure - Trade - Prescription drug costs
Trump now ridiculing losing Republicans who he thinks avoided him.  "Too bad Mike", he says to now outgoing CO Rep. Mike Coffman.  "Mia Love gave me no love."  "Peter Roskam didn't want the embrace"
NOW: We have the slower-speaking, gentler version of Pres. Trump giving remarks to reporters at the WH.    Will be interesting to see if he stays in this mode through questions.
RIGHT NOW: Dems are +32 for these midterms.  And DCCC Chair Ben Lujan is reminding reporters there are still outstanding races in places like CA and Maine.
Big +1! One of the great TV stations in this country.  (I think that won't go tontheir heads.) https://t.co/nprR8YO89F
NOW: About to do a kind of post-party election drill down w/ the great Dan Bush - on Facebook and Youtube for @NewsHour
SO FAR GOP INCUMBENTS HOLDING ON: Vern Buchanan, Brian Mast, Mario Diaz-Balart all declared winners in FL.  BUT BEHIND, in trouble at moment are: VA NJ's Leonard Lance, IL's Randy Hultgren and Peter Roskam.  IN VIRGINIA: Dave Brat and Scott Taylor are virtually tied w/ Dems.
@ArizonaWildcat @IAmAmnaNawaz Great reminder and advice! That was me.  Will adjust absolutely.
I predict Joe Manchin becomes a WV Senator for life.
FIRST DEM PICKUP OF THE NIGHT.  AP calls VA-10 for Dem Jennifer Wexton.  Barbara Comstock becomes the first defeated incumbent of the niht.
RURAL COUNTIES COMING IN.  Democrat McGrath 51% GOP Barr 47%  (49% reporting) https://t.co/RG0wh6RW3a
WHAT WILL BE FIRST DEM PICKUP OF NIGHT? Possibility:  KY 06 - w/ 33% of results: Dem Amy McGrath 54%  GOP Rep. Andy Barr 45%
PELOSI NOW to @JudyWoodruff: For impeachment to happen it would have to be bipartisan and the evidence would have to be overwhelming (from Mueller investigation).  Insists "that's not what our caucus is about".
NOW: Democratic Leader @NancyPelosi is here at @NewsHour talking about this election, beginning by saying that Republicans are not telling the truth about pre-existing conditions.
AT 6p ET/9p PT POLLS CLOSING in:  - KY-06 Rep. Andy Barr v Dem Amy McGrath - MOST of Indiana
OK FOLKS.  First polls are getting ready to close.   *flexes fingers for night of typing and what appears to be a rather amazing election to cover (number, types of races)*
Polls are open (in a few states)!! #ElectionDayNerd
President Trump just mispronounced "Limo, Ohio" at least three times in a row.    Something not hard to do.  But the OH crowd seemed to care not in the least.
Yes, yes please. https://t.co/S74JzZgIeN
It sounds like Pres. Trump did not mention Rep. Steve Chabot, an OH GOP'er who is in a dogfight of a toss-up race right now.
NOW: First member of Congress Pres. Trump introduces at his Ohio rally? @Jim_Jordan
@KaraGormleyM @OnPointRadio Blushing.
@cvaldaisnotbig @OnPointRadio Thank you - will do! And have a question for you - what do you think will happen in the John Faso/Antonio Delgado race?
NOW: on air as part of excellent midterms preview show on @OnPointRadio - I'm sitting in my radio booth fascinated by the conversation - esp from the smart listeners checking in. https://t.co/6eAoq1XxMS
Thanks for that - I didn't mean to imply the entire GOP is pushing back of course.    But in the future will add perhaps "one republican is pushing back..." does that help?
GOP pushback at Saudi Arabia as one small child's photo is sparking renewed outrage. https://t.co/NDaDMuXi7a
See comments to this tweet - getting some sincere responses.  cc: @BarackObama https://t.co/ibVuuazkeG
OBAMA now: "Why is it that the folks who won the last election are so mad all the time?"
OBAMA now as hecklers/protesters erupt as he speaks for Gillum:   "If you support the other candidates, go support the other candidate. Don't come here. Why would you come here?"
Significant for a few reasons, but biggest is Wagner has become more vulnerable - her seat is not a given. https://t.co/nBjVPRplhs
Just tuning in - did President Trump in Missouri neglect to list Ann Wagner when he listed the GOP members of Congress?
QUESTIONS FOR POTUS: - When exactly is new asylum policy going in place? - What did he mean that "catch and release" ended a few days ago? - Where is $ coming from for tent detention centers/tent cities? - How is he sure no one in caravan has legitimate asylum claim?
Immigration order coming next week, says @realDonaldTrump
THIS IS THE NEW TRUMP ASYLUM POLICY:  Asylum seekers can only claim asylum at ports of entry (waiting to see if Trump limits which ones).  Would change who is eligible, blocking anyone undocumented and in the U.S. from seeking asylum.  Some debate over if he has this power.
Trump: just said he ended "Catch and Release" as of a few days ago.  He signed an order ending it in April. (And has spoken repeatedly in the past as if it had already ended.)
Trump's argument: Caravan members do not want asylum b/c if they did they would accept it from Mexico.  His opponents' argument: those on the caravan do not see Mexico as significantly safer or better than their home country.
Trump: these "illegal caravans will not be allowed into the United States and they should turn back now."  Reminder: asylum seeking is part of the legal process, it is not illegal.
Heads up that the president seems to be alternating between on and off script at the moment.
Trump: as he talks about blocking illegal immigration, also says "we need" legal immigration.   Then says there is a limit to how much immigration a society can absorb.
Trump: "Under my leadership (America) is a welcoming country."
NOW.   Headline on CNN: "Trump talks immigration after new racially charged ad."  Headline on FOX: "Trump to deliver remarks on immigration as caravan heads to U.S."
Least surprising thing about the past two months is that Harry Reid is back on our Twitter feeds.
Please tell me who is in control of @RoyBlunt 's Twitter feed right now.  It is an unexpected party of gif.
@RoyBlunt Please tell me you have seen this movie, yes?
@BenHowe @NewsHour stand by.
@BenHowe @NewsHour One of those days. Meant, of course, that we are happily NOT in the mix on that one.
@TexasTribAbby @CWSoftballGame Oh they are so good at jinxing themselves. Can't wait.  cc: @DWStweets @KathyCastorFL @CheriBustos @SenGillibrand @RepLujanGrisham bcc: @RosLehtinen @RepMarthaRoby

Psst. ICYMI. Strong INDIANA Senate debate last night, led by moderator @IAmAmnaNawaz:  - GOP's Braun avoided looking at Dem Donnelly - Amna kept them on topic. - The lighting helped neither of them. - And Libertarian Lucy Brenton was a stand out.   WATCH: https://t.co/gJRktz7EZZ
Contender for favorite '18 subject line: "Pancake breakfast fuels final election push".  (From the Michigan Conservative Coalition and I think @meshawnmaria.)
CONG LEADERS' OFFICES TO ME ON WHY NOT GOING TO PITTSBURGH w/ TRUMP: McConnell:  long-standing, announced plans. Ryan: Not make it on short notice. Schumer: Scheduling. *Pelosi*: Out of respect for the wishes of the mayor and other officials (who asked Trump not to come.)
Really nice job by @DanaBashCNN speaking to the murders in Pittsburgh and calmly, strongly speaking truth.  Proud to call her my friend.
NATURE COULD DECIDE THE FL SENATE RACE.    Here's our our story from the area where red tide is again approaching.   https://t.co/df84mGRhYr
@LACaldwellDC @NewsHour Totally #greatminds.  Just unhappy we did not get a moment of beach time together. Universe, I blame you.
@NewsHour @WmBrangham FASCINATING STATE - FULL COVERAGE:  I’ll be in Florida with @JudyWoodruff, @Yamiche and our @NewsHour team for a special broadcast TONIGHT.   Send thoughts here.    -30-
@NewsHour @WmBrangham The environment is factor in ads and campaigns, not just in Florida, but in other states across the country during #Midterms2018: Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio.
@NewsHour What is red tide?   My colleague @WmBrangham looked at it a couple of months ago: https://t.co/yO4M8sW8zF
@NewsHour SUPPORTERS OF SCOTT: Say he only cut environmental budgets out of necessity, due to lean times. They point out he has recently increased them again. Opponents say he did that b/c he saw the political problem mounting.
@NewsHour RICK SCOTT’s PROBLEM:  While some voters praise him on hurricane response, toxic algae issues are hitting what are normally GOP areas.  Without looking for them, we repeatedly found Republicans who say they are voting Bill Nelson b/c they think Scott harmed the environment.
FLORIDA KEY ISSUE: The ENVIRONMENT is now a potentially deciding force in Florida’s elections (esp. U.S. Senate). -Ride tide -Blue-green algae -Hurricane response -Climate change.   That’s my story for @NewsHour tonight… starting *this thread* on what we found.
Keep on the radar: Continued attention on the Fed and President Trump's wish it were not as independent. https://t.co/zdNf9W7UWD
NEW CNN SUSPICIOUS PKG: the network says it has similar appearance to those received last week.
+1 https://t.co/YuntruDenq
@KrickerJoshua @JudyWoodruff @NewsHour Except. One of our panelists runs the largest progressive group in the state.  She chose to focus on bipartisan remarks in our sitdown and we of course respected that - wanted whatever these women wanted to say.
@__roy96 @JudyWoodruff @NewsHour Understandable question. We did look for racially diverse voices, but ultimately chose panelists based on the topics they shared and the best combination in terms of views.  We wanted four people and that meant tough choices, like the one you raise.
@grainreader @TickTockDiner @JudyWoodruff @NewsHour Sadly me and the team (Julie Percha) did NOT.  We wanted to but weee scared of being in food coma during taping.
@NJTVNews - The NJ Sen candidates definitely mixed it up and got VERY personal. More than most debates. - But why wasn't it a blood-bath of attacks? I honestly think @MichaelAronNJTV (and me too)  signaled early/often/clearly we wanted real answers and not pointless yelling.
WHAT I SAW CO-MODERATING THE NJ SENATE DEBATE:  - Menendez and Hugin *never* shook hands. - Menendez visibly came ready to rumble. (Tough look on face.) - Hugin took a min to figure out where to look (cameras), then got it.  More... cc: @NJTVNews
Note to self: look alive. https://t.co/BO2a78S3jK
UM.  I think this debate could be intense (Bob Menendez v Bob Hugin) Here's the scene outside our studio.  I'll. E co-moderating. 8PM ON @NJTVNews AND @NewsHour online.    PS I love New Jersey. https://t.co/xdGWMeatVn
NOW : about to do live talk about a wild Nj Senate race w great folks of @NJTVNews inclusion NJ politics dean @MichaelAronNJTV on Facebook live - go to their page. https://t.co/OAJljmtTMl
One of the most explosive contests in the country. https://t.co/Bq7lch2EkL
And second coin toss - called by Team Hugin. Also heads. https://t.co/coZaGQwP2n
NJ SENATE COIN TOSS RESULTS: 1. Heads.  MENENDEZ team picked it and wins the podium toss. 2. Also heads. HUGIN team picked it and wins speaking order.  Evidence - toss one -  attached. (Apologies it was a very shiny quarter.) https://t.co/MGTa5SnBZP
And we have results in NJ.  First, you need to know there were two coin tosses.   1. Podium position (Menendez campaign called heads or tails). and  2. Opening/closing order (Hugin campaign called it).
COMING UP - MIDTERMS COIN TOSS: I'm in Jersey prepping for Menendez v Hugin debate (co-moderating w/ @NJTVNews it Weds!) ... IN 15 MIN we have the coin toss for opening statements.    Heads or tails folks?    (And I'll post video to verify.)
@MEPFuller Matt you never fail to put a smile on my face.    I also treasure our walks on tree-lined walkways, with green beverages.  I don't tell you that enough.
MCCONNELL and POCAHONTAS: Asked about remarks last night in which he called Elizabeth Warren "Pocahontas" - does he see that as fair game?  McConnell: I have no comment about that.
MCCONNELL NOW on SAUDI ARABIA: "This particular incident will really challenge (our relationship)."
THIS. NEW: McConnell was just asked if it's possible to move President Trump toward cutting/reforming entitlements.   McConnell: "I don't think so."   He went on to agree that entitlements will have to wait for another president and bipartisan action.  (@Phil_Mattingly's q)
MCCCONNELL NOW: It's pretty obvious we have very competitive races (all over).  It's like a knife fight, everyone is doing what they can to win.
MCCONNELL to us now: touts Kavanaugh effect in Montana, Missouri and Indiana Senate races specifically.    Says he also sees continued rise in interest from GOP and Kavanaugh is one reason.
QUESTIONS FOR LEADER MCCONNELL?: Send them my way.
@LaurieLleclair You are wonderful. Would be happy to talk to them off record too - whatever they are comfortable with. DM'ing you my email.
@LaurieLleclair Absolutely. Undecided in general approaching midterms. (House or Sen.) Can be from any party or independent. And this is for a story we are doing - hoping to set up a roundtable of smart NJ voters. Crossing fingers - let me know if prefer to DM!
@LaurieLleclair Great. Thank you!
@AndreasLupus That is great.
@demodisping Sincerely and greatly appreciate that!
REQUEST for you Twitter.  Looking for thoughtful, **undecided voters in New Jersey*.   For upcoming story.  Know any? Would be grateful for recommendations! Send Twitter handles or message me so we can DM.
@TheApartment Good q but I don't think I would use the word "covering". Laugh.  Though I am tweeting about it b/c it is definitely something a) unusual and b) I'm trying to sort out.
Sidenote to add to all of this: Those of us watching, just saw Kanye enter his phone password.   And it looked really uncomplicated.
KANYE REPLAY NOW from Oval Office and indeed a long continuous sentence. So far including: - Anti-Trump bias (and anti-MAGA hat bias) - Growing up w/ out dad at home - His business and millions/billions - Bringing jobs - Montessori - theWaldorf-Astoria.  Trump has yet to speak.
20 min until close. https://t.co/Kgxfbwi43D
@nikitos1979hmm Thank you for this feedback, I do appreciate it.
@SueDenim18 @BarryshopeHope @Glutton4Pnshmnt Thank you for the feedback. Honestly.  My tweet was not aimed at judging anyone's skills or abilities.  Wanted to note a a statistical fact.  My intention was similar to say looking at whether the US is proportionally represented in world bodies.  But I do appreciate the feedbck
@SenatorZero Thank you - i'm definitely chewing on it and sorting out how to handle better in the future.
@new_yawwker Thank you - see my latest tweet. Do appreciate the feedback. And not saying this to you in any kind of condescending or remotely lefty way.    (I really don't subscribe to any party or political view - question them all.)
@laurenwilltellu @civilsoapbox Thank you for the tweet, sincerely. See my last tweet.
SEEING A LOT OF THIS. Among signs that political currents have shifted - or that ppl on right are more openly unhappy race or what they see as pc'ness - there's a lot of frustration with my tweet about the composition of the cabinet.   (Ty all. Sincerely like pushback, feedback) https://t.co/ftGooEEVZ8
@FHamster28 Thank you for the tweet.  I want to get things right and most definitely do not want to be racist toward any race, including the white race. But help me understand your point of view.  Mine was to point out a statist. significant diff b/t the cabinet and population.
@PepperGii But set me straight - do you find "person of color" offensive? And can you point me to a greater conversation on this? Of course interested and want to get it right. What is a better term for non-white Americans?
@PepperGii Sincere thanks for the tweet. I definitely want to adjust if I'm out of line but I hear that term used by non-white experts and people.  Was using that b/c, as you know, Hispanic is not a racial reference, but ethnicity. So often "often color" brings in that idea.
REMINDER, Haley is one of: - 6 women on the Trump cabinet. (Out of 24 members.)  - 4 people of color on the cabinet.  - If she were replaced by a white man, the cabinet would go from 66% white men to 70% white men.  - The nation, in contrast, is 31% white men.
Significant so far about the Haley news is that no one in the WH leaked exactly what the news is (other than her resigning) so far.
@dodgr007 @kenrudin I endorse. I think we should all call it a week, frankly.
Completely unsubstantiated, random wrong Haley guesses on the "big announcement" (add!): - Special adviser having to do w/ women in workplace - Running for office in 2020  - CFPB - "Special adviser" on something else - FEMA - New ambassador elsewhere - Trump SEC (football) Czar
HALEY WATCH: Now Axios, CNN and FOX have confirmed that she has resigned.  And we now expect to hear from her with the president in next bit of time in the Oval. (h/t @johnyangtv )
Resignation watch.
Really looking forward to this @60Minutes.
MCCONELL SUMARY: - was clearly very happy - said we stood up to the mob - insisted Merrick Garland freeze was same as what Democrats would have done - also said GOP would like, will keep working to have female senator on Judiciary
Before this day ends:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHESTER ARTHUR!  I'm sorry the Senate stole your day.  Enjoy that fine wine you've got. #ILikePort
@SweetSeaChick Huh. Please notify the census. They have it at 48% women to 52% men.   https://t.co/TaqaXedJkn
@sarakettering @JudyWoodruff @NewsHour @Yamiche So so true. We are *extremely* lucky.    Now all three of us just need someone to make all the news stop for at least one week. Thank you.
@beilis_jay @JudyWoodruff @NewsHour @Yamiche Right!???!  *pinches self*
@Andre_Sagovia @JudyWoodruff @NewsHour @Yamiche Completely respect your opinion and we need all feedback. But want to make sure you have watched our segments this week? Maybe take another look? We worked hard at balance, clear thought.
ICYMI @mtill50 is being sarcastic here.  @NewsHour is all about the @redsox nation. #NunezHour https://t.co/o0ckd4d698
Not fake news.  (Really it was a bit intense.) https://t.co/rHUenFPJNa
MANCHIN VIDEO:  among the more intense senator q&amp;a's I ever experienced... he just announced his yes and was nearly drowned out by protesters. https://t.co/BldwzJmVO8
MANCHIN IS A YES.  BRETT KAVANUGH FULLY SET TO BE CONFIRMED AS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
WHY YES?: Collins said she does not believe Kavanaugh's past rulings show he will overturn Roe or favor the presidency.  She believes Ford was harmed but also said Ford's allegations did meet a "more likely" standard. And Collins lashed out at the final, Avenatti-led allegatios.
COLLINS: is a final YES  If Flake does not change, this means Kavanaugh will be confirmed.
COLLINS: has clearly done her homework. Seems to be getting close to end decision now.
@pawliticks Yes if Manchin goes from yes on procedural to no on final.  But Pence has some time, possibly a day, until the vote
SO, it sure sounds like Collins is winding up to being a final "yes".   This shifts focus next onto Manchin.  With Murkowski after that (she signaled to reporters a statement of some sort will be made soon).
Protesters: show up for Maine women, vote no!
NOW: Sen. Kamala Harris telling the Senate about cases in which potential jurors privately confided they had been sexually assaulted, but had never told anyone - including their spouses.  But told attorneys b/c they didn't feel they could sit on a jury in such a case.
I confirm and endorse.  And add that she was looking down before the vote started.  Clasping hands and softly looking down. https://t.co/BqGd3Ovbvx
A VERY POSITIVE NOTE for humankind: a lovely senate restaurant staffer on way back to kitchen just offered coffee, OJ from this cart to the press, who has been waiting for Murkowski for quite a while.  Very grateful.  Love Senate staff. https://t.co/hcsjjUfhVZ
THIS. BLUNT: told me he does not think Murkowski or Manchin's votes will change.    (Reminder again: he was the main GOP vote counter for the Republicans in the House at one time.)
DAINES: told us that he head "transportation" ready that will get him to his daughter's wedding tomorrow if he is needed on tomorrow's vote.
SPOTTED: guests in VIP section hugging (one pair of ppl) and fist pumping, while saying "yes!" (One person) After cloture vote.
WHERE WE ARE: Kavanaugh will advance, but apparently Collins is reserving ability to vote differently on final confirmation tomorrow.  NOTE: collins is the senator who has done this the most - voting one way on procedural motions to open:/close debate and another on final motions
Manchin yes means @vp Pence does not need to break tie
Wow Manchin is a yes.
Murkowski's no was quiet - press corps all verified w each other that it was "no".
MURKOWSKI NO(!!)
FLAKE AND COLLINS ARE BOTH YES.    Unless a surprise, Kavanaugh is on his way to confirmation.   (EVEN  if Murkowski and Manchin are no. )
Here we go!!
In the chamber now: Murkowski and Collins (and most of GOP) are seated.  Flame and Manchin not in yet. Murkowski and Collins look poised. No expressions.    Most Dems not in chamber yet.
Meantime, guys I'm going to be off and on Twitter - have to leave me cell at senate chamber door as I go in.   Will come back when I can.
THIS.  Now, me to Senator Blunt (the #4 Republican in Senate): Senator do you have the votes?  Blunt: I don't know.   PS Blunt used to be the whip, or bite counter for GOP in the House.
Now at @SenatorCollins office: anti-Kavanaugh folks inside the entrance, pro-Kavanaugh outside. https://t.co/BrrqprR3TP
WHAT YOU DONT SEE. NOW: a lot of VIP guests entering balconies around Senate. Just saw one large group described as from the WH.   I joked with one doorkeeper "wow this is like State of the Union" and they responded "actually it's close."
Now.   Me to Feinstein: Senator what's your sense of how the vote looks? Feinstein: close.
NOW: Grassley on the Senate floor to being the ramp-up to the vote.
TO WATCH TODAY: - Obviously the 4: Collins, Flake, Manchin, Murkowski.  But also... - Will protesters make it into the Sen chamber. V possible?  (PS 300+ arrests yesterday.) - How quickly either side launches ads (And yes final vote tomorrow, but this one effectively decides.)
@expressojf @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @JoeManchinWV "Essentially"
CLEARLY they are celebrating Chester Arthu's birthday. Which is today.  (He appointed two Supreme Court justices.) https://t.co/noYSgqtDXl
REMINDER: if at least two of these four people vote yes on Kavanaugh he will move forward... Collins, Flake, Manchin, Murkowski.   (Barring a surprise change of heart by some other senator.)
OK FOLKS, two hours until the vote which essentially will decide if Brett Kavanaugh becomes the next Supreme Court justice.    Cc: @JeffFlake, @lisamurkowski, @SenatorCollins and @JoeManchinWV
Sorry fellas, both are terrible names. https://t.co/aW8SSpFcrU
Or, alternately it means:  1. GOP feels confident they don't need his vote, so he can say this up front  OR 2. GOP will try to hold the vote open and he returns for it Sunday. https://t.co/M4XeCythcD
BREAKING - NEW: Cornyn just told me the cloture vote will be tomorrow around 10:30a.  That sets up final Kavanaugh confirmation for around *4:30p* Saturday.
GAH. Math.  Resending this. Standby. https://t.co/5zqEXPaQP0
BREAKING - NEW: Cornyn just told me the cloture vote will be tomorrow around 10:30a.  That sets up final Kavanaugh confirmation for around 2:30p Saturday.
GRASSLEY: Now releasing several weeks of frustration.  Saying he believes in the importance of the press but sees bias and the press needs to be aware of it.
VOTE TIMING INDICATION(?): Grassley just said that hopefully we are "about 48 hours away" from having new justice on the Supreme Court.    (That would fit with rumors going around this am for 10a cloture vote tomorrow and 2p final vote Saturday. Though who knows.)
NOW: GOP Leader McConnell, Chairman Grassley and four other Repubs on Senate Judiciary Committee at newser. Grassley: "this nominee should be confirmed Saturday." https://t.co/BR4U1bMmHN
FYI: It is exceedingly rare for McConnell to hold a news conference outside of his regular weekly Tuesday news conference.   (THis is not unique to him as a Sen. Leader, but notable.)
HEADS UP: have been giving 1 minute notice on McConnell Kavanaugh newser.
WHY IS HEITKAMP A NO? She writes: - We need to take politics out of the Supreme Court as much as possible - I voted for Justice Gorsuch because I felt his legal ability and temperament qualified him to serve on the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh is different.
WHAT 18 different senators said to us after reading the new Kavanaugh report.    https://t.co/ioKjgIYO9j  @NewsHour
FYI vote counters: Manchin has not read the report yet and am told he plans to today.  (He's the last of the three Gorsuch Dems to decide on Kavanaugh - Heitkamp and Donnelly are no's.)
@tul1245 Sad face.
WHICH means the FBI did obtain text message chains as part of this Kavanaugh report, which we didn't know before.  (Still not clear whose texts or about what.)
Rounds said it was "part of the reports" - like text message chains -  and that other parts are being passed around. https://t.co/dvlIevWUO7
And new:  Sen. Rounds indicated that at times staff will read a series of text messages outloud for senators, with a different staffer reading for a different person on the text chain.
HOW SENATORS ARE GOING THROUGH THE REPORT: There is one report and dozens of senators.  But Sen. Rounds just told me they are divvying up sections, such as each witness interview, or a section on text messages, and each tackling a piece at a time as they sit around a table.
SEN KENNEDY (GOP) after reading the report just now: "I really wish you could see this.  Let me say that again. I really wish you could see this.  There are things in here that really make me angry."
Dear press corps waiting for senators to emerge from reading the FBI report, I have the one chair available to all of us.    (It's against a wall in opposite direction of the room we are staring at.)    And I'm willing to trade for snacks.
NOW: Flake also in the room to read the FBI report. Meaning, he and Collins and Murkowski are among those in there now.
NOW: Sens Collins and Murkowski are among those in the secure area for reading the FBI report.  Believe they expect to be there a while. Murkowski told our @DanielBush she may come back again later if not enough time now. (Here's photo of collins going on.) https://t.co/hJeg28zP1y
COLLINS (still catching up, sorry):  "it appears to be a very thorough investigation but I am going back later today to personally read the interviews."
FLAKE: (there was) no additional corroborating information.
NEW: Graham told us the FBI report includes interviews w 10 witnesses - that is people named by Ford, Debbie Ramirez herself and people she named.   He says it added nothing new in terms of the accusations and he says it actually went the other way (tho he didn't specify).
*affixes cell phone back-up battery*
Our @DanielBush spotted Durbin.  Also Baldwin.
Gillibrand. (Add to Murray, Whitehouse and Cardin which I tweeted sloppily outside this thread.)
Ok also inside now: Whitehouse, Cardin, bunch of Dem staffers.
First my autocorrects are the worst.  And second, scones ate delicious.
And a new Senator is inside - Dem Patty Murray.  She's the scone Dem senator we've seen (Feinstein). GOP brieifng still underway. None have emerged.
OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL NOW: a few Kavanaugh supporters are waving flags and chanting "gotta have Kav"! https://t.co/r13fQrMkIm
And I'm stepping away for a sec to bring in some good @Newshour help... @tkconch
Corker, Sullivan, Isakson, Lankford all just arrived. https://t.co/xBpToqp8Au
Collins and Portman and Scott. https://t.co/jQPSSsjbgJ
Capito and Thune have joined. https://t.co/6EsA3Qobg2
And Risch.
Toomey and Cassidy here now too.
And Daines and Barasso.
And Blunt. https://t.co/azep7LyB2l
Add: Grassley, Hatch, Shelby,, Ernst, Cotton, Fisher, Perdue and Flake. All inside now. https://t.co/OACRQpUFCT
And Rubio is here.
And MCCONNELL has arrived, entered secure are w FBI report.   (Last tweet btw - *Jeb* was bad autofill for *he* somehow.) https://t.co/H8zxsaUx5f
And just now - Sen. Kennedy.
Add Sens. Rounds, Wicker and Hyde-Smith as GOP members gather for 10a briefing on the report.  Rounds said Jeb has asked for a slot to read the report later.
NOW: Sen. @JohnCornyn just went in to  the secure FBI report area, as did @SenMikeLee. They are the third and fourth senators we've seen.
SECOND SENATOR gew minutes ago entered area to view FBI KAVANAIGH report - GOP Sen. Mike Crapo.
@seungminkim Can you throw down some snacks? https://t.co/WE6Y6FXzAM
AND we have our first senator arriving to read the FBI supplemental report on Kavanaugh: @SenFeinstein . https://t.co/KPWMVi3Koc
NOW:  so far zero senators at Capitol basement secure location where  FBI report is waiting - some GOP staff tho.  Otherwise just press, mostly still photographers. https://t.co/vnhzmur1op
@BlueInRedID @HelenArmstrong5 Thanks Blue.    Helen thanks to you too - it's not an unfair point.  But, does it help to say that was my way of sorting out when this important move would happen?  (And it did help!) Wasn't trying to make light of anything so much as bring some light.

BREAKING: McConnell is filing cloture now.  Means Friday cloture vote. (Key vote.)  And possible Kavanaugh final confirmation Saturday.
MCCONNELL on the floor.
McConnell senior aide gives us the answer ---&gt; https://t.co/N5KF85uZ78
Oh snap.  If you went with "UNDER", it is looking good for you right now. https://t.co/PsDkms7ezC
@munderw341 @jamiedupree He can do it solo. Though at hte least there will be a Dem on the floor too, to make sure there aren't a slew of other motions/votes w/ no one there.
PLACE YOUR BETS. OK I'm setting over/under for McConnell filing cloture at 11:30 pm.  Get in your over/under here.
@jamiedupree Yep!  What I'm looking for is exact time.    I'm thinking the over/under is 11:15.  Just random guess there.
What is the over/under on when McConnell files cloture?
Again. CAPS. What. is. happening.
KAVANAUGH REMINDER:  If McConnell files cloture before midnight, the Senate could take the key vote (cloture) as soon as 1 a.m. Friday.    That would set up final confirmation Saturday (if 50 senators support Kavanaugh).
As bad as DC politics are, the Capitols are good.
Thinking of all the people and especially the officers in Florence, SC.  That was where my reporting career started (in split market w/ Myrtle Beach).    I have great love for the Pee Dee.
Two minutes into the season and 2-0.
CAPS CAPS CAPS!!!
@steven_maines Don't barf! Esp in your car!! https://t.co/fhEHIrzM4u
NOW: actually a significant thing.  Senate giving final passage to legislation to address the opioid crisis.    It is a 650-page bipartisan bill that all agree does get at some of the problem, though leaves much left to do too.   But a start in an otherwise bitterly divided DC.
America united by presidential alert.
Oh gosh.  Sanders: I don't have a problem stating the facts. (to @Acosta) Though that is something you might have a problem with
Except.   The president said Ford did not remember "upstairs? downstairs?"    In reality, she consistently, repeatedly said the attack happened upstairs.
SANDERS on what President Trump said last night in mocking Christine Blasey Ford: "The president was stating the facts."
Significant here. FLAKE: to @mkraju signals he is not concerned about possibility that FBI may not talk with Christine Blasey Ford.   Says "she spoke to the committee" and he wants the FBI to follow up on things that are not yet known, more open questions.
ICYM. @SenatorCollins on the president's remarks last night: “The president’s comments were just plain wrong.”
GILLIBRAND: I forwarded a letter to the FBI today from a constituent who has something they'd like to share w/ the FBI re: the Kavanaugh investigation.  I don't think they are doing a thorough investigation.
NOW: Graham is now invoking John McCain, saying he would have felt similarly, raising questions about the process and timing of allegations against Kavanaugh.
GRAHAM: "I've never seen the Republican Party so unified as I do right now."
NOW: worth watching live interview w/ @LindseyGrahamSC - one of best, most detailed conversations about why he believes what he believes and doubts what he doubts re: Kavanaugh.  https://t.co/saxM4fzQCD
FYI, this.    It's complicated b/c of the threats against @SenatorCollins, who has faced more harassment, serious threats and personal attack than I believe people realize.  It is neither hypothetical nor casual.  But press has never personally been a threat to senators. https://t.co/T08zwSKyvh
SCHUMER: of Dems take over the Senate, we will have to look at setting the SCOTUS nominee requirement back up to 60 votes
NOW: Schumer is asking 1. WH release its directing statement to FBI on Kavanaugh investigation 2. There be an all-senators meeting 3. FBI report be released publicly
TRUMP: Lindsey's a friend of mine. At least for the last six months or so.  (Goes on to praise his support of Kavanaugh.)
TRUMP: I don't think you should lie to Congress. There have been a lot of people who have lied to Congress in the last year, to me that is not acceptable.  I think Judge Kavanaugh is doing well right now. A lot depends on the FBI.
@edokeefe Congratulations Ed! She's a beauty.
And scene.
Just b/c POTUS asked, KAVANAUGH did not graduate first in his class at Yale.   He graduated cum laude. Which is a significant, remarkable achievement.  (And def better than I did at W&amp;M.)  But it means top 20-30%.  Below summa and magna cum laude.
Full Trump.   Wow. President Trump is directly attacking @SenBlumenthal from 2010 and now Sen. @CoryBooker  from high school.
Trump: I watched him. I was surprised how open he was about the fact that he likes beer.
POTUS NOW: It is up to me, but I'm instructing (the FBI) as per what the Senate wants.   (Re: Kavanaugh investigation)
@jbendery Had been waiting for someone to transcribe that.
TRUMP: that being said, I would like it to go quickly. And the reason is simple - what he and his family are going through.
Question: Are you limiting the scope of the Kavanaugh invstgtn?  POTUS: I said the Senate is determining scope and let the FBI do what it has to do. But think about the trauma his family has gone through.
TRUMP: Ok, let's go. (On Kavanaugh.)
Would love to see stats on Capitol Hill, strongly suspect it is similar if not less diverse.  B/c most of the on-air broadcasters  and ft producers on the Hill are also white. To understate: It's a problem. https://t.co/2Fx8aGCMXp
Trump news conference turning into bifurcated event as reporters ask Kavanaugh questions and the president says he will come back to them after answering more NAFTA questions.   (Smart on his part - once it gets off NAFTA, questions will likely stay off NAFTA)
NEW JERSEY SENATE more:   GOP is winning the "define your opponent" battle:    Menendez' unfavorables are up (again) - at 53.5%  Vs Hugin, largest group of voters - 41% - are "unfamiliar" w/ him.
NEW!: Another well-regarded poll shows NJ Dem @BobMenendezNJ is fighting for his political life.  45% Menendez, 43% Hugin.   This from Stockton (B+ on @538politics)  https://t.co/kREnb7dUWY
Answer 1 (Trudeau): Our relationship didn't affect this, he's a professional.  I just spoke w/ him, we have a great relationship.  There was a lot of tension.
It IS a news conference!!   Question 1: How did your  bumpy relationship w/ Trudeau affect this?
This is veering on full Trump.
POTUS: This is one of the best trade deals for manufacturing, workers and for farmers.  I will sign it in November.  Meantime: See below for what  remains as my first question. https://t.co/DfrP2T4tQL
TRUMP: I will sign the agreement at the end of November and then send it to Congress.  He notes passage there is not yet assured.  (Among other reasons, Democrats may win control of the House or Senate in the election.)
My first question is whether this is actually a news conference.  (The president previously has used that term for what turned out to be a speech. One ex: when he announced he does believe President Obama was born in the United States.)
NOW: @POTUS news conference beginning.
VERY REAL POSSIBILITY: Senate votes to begin Kavanaugh debate tomorrow, and poss. even on voice vote.  GOP would need to guarantee no cloture vote, final vote series until FBI is done.
GRASSLEY: just came out, said a statement is coming and "it was a good day!" Bc the committee moved Kavanaugh out of committee.  HE WAS SWARMED by reporters. https://t.co/bvwKPVsjpA
We know Cornyn and Hatch have left the GOP Kavanaugh huddle in McConnell's office.  Waiting for everyone else.
THIS - BREAKING: Cornyn told us there will be a supplemental FBI investigation. To last no more than a week.
WHERE THINGS STAMD ON KAVANAUGH: we are waiting outside McConnells office where Judiciary Republicans and Lisa Murkowski are meeting.   And reporters have formed the world's dorkiest soul train line. https://t.co/vpN2fCqBoO
MANCHIN: announces he is in on the one-week Flake delay.   "The American people have been pulled apart by this entire spectacle and we need to take time to address these claims independently..."
VERY BIG. Means McConnell must delay Kavanaugh ---&gt; https://t.co/OPRLn9GgmU
NOW:  Senate Judiciary GOP meeting in McConnell's office.  Flake, Grassley had police escorts.    Which is not usual for them. (Or hadn't been.)
Um. ALL *GOP* SENATORS WILL MEET.   Me to Cornyn: Will Republicans meet as a group today?  Cornyn: yep.    (Asked twice to be sure.)  Details tbd. https://t.co/KpC9gmtoFa
NEW: Flake just went into McConnell's office. Would not say if he has assurances from anyone else on votes.  Me: Have you spoken to the White House about this?  Flake: No.
UNCLEAR: If GOP attempt the vote tomorrow, which is technically to open the Kavanaugh debate.    Why would they? To get that off the books and get procedural clocks moving while the FBI does whatever is agreed upon for the FBI to do. (If the president allows the FBI to do it.)
GRAHAM: on way to McConnell's office, told us "that's democracy" and that he does think Flake is being sincere, so they will look for something reasonable.
@amyewalter no we don't know that yet.
THIS - SEN ROUNDS: told me that talks now are over how long delay most be and they still hope to confirm Kavanaigh by end of next week.
ALL GOO SENATORS WILL MEET.   Me to Cornyn: Will Republicans meet as a group today?  Cornyn: yep.    (Asked twice to be sure.)  Details tbd.
KAVANAUGH COMMITTEE VOTE: Nomination goes to floor 11-10.
GRASSLEY wants to have this vote so much he has not clarified if this is a vote to recommend Kavanaugh favorably or w/out recommendation.
FLAKE struck a deal. He will vote yes now, but only w/ understanding that FBI must investigate and floor vote delayed a week.
MASSIVE NEWS. BREAKING NOW @JeffFlake says: "I think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to but not more than one week to let the FBI do investigation."
Flake is here!
JUDICIARY BACK IN SESSION. Durbin is only Dem, seems here protectively.
MOST GOP RETURNING TO JUDIC. COMMITTEE - BUT NO FLAKE.
And everyone watching at home, they just told us we reporters were blocking tv view (gah), so we have moved.
Grassley just returned on his own to antechamber, had a kind of "time to get this show on the road" look.
Graham has returned.
Something that may prove handy:  the committee *can* vote to send a nominee to the floor w/out recommendation.  That is judgment neutral.  But allows a Senate floor vote.
NOW: sen graham called back, going back to the antechamber huddle.
It seems very likely this sideroom huddle has a quorum of Judiciary Committee members.
Grassley back in committee room. Republicans not here: Flake, Sasse, Cruz, Coryn... and now Tillis just went to get Mike Lee and bring him to the huddle.
No Democrats are in hearing room.  Those here all just walked to antechamber.   Grasssley came back briefly and returned.
Grassley is back.  No one else. Oops and he's gone again.
This is serious.   Grassley just left to talk w senators in antechamber. We believe Flake among them.
1 minute to vote time and six Dems and three Repubs not here. https://t.co/eNbXxqlnqF
Sasse was talking w Whitehouse.  Tillis talking w Leahy.   Unclear if this means anything .
Now I'm one of those people taking photos of all these small interactions. https://t.co/PQ89K4KEmT
Meantime, all those camera clicks you hear are tricky. My take: this is not a visual place. They are looking for anything AT ALL.  So if two senators talk - click click click click. If Grassley holds cell phone to head - click click click (And sometimes senators are making deals)
PAUSE in hearing is because: every senator present has spoken.  Grassley will now wait until 1:30 when the vote will happen.  Or a senator who hasn't spoken yet (hey! @JeffFlake !) could still come to their mic.
@RoKhanna Perhaps you meant "as early as Tuesday"?
THIS, for your midterm and Dem watch file: https://t.co/TEOiFTKEP2
@Phil_Mattingly Dude I lowballed this at under two and a half this am, and people thought I was crazy on the high end then.
@dexteritee @tntdrama Tru.
AND NO GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. (btw.)  The president has signed the spending bill.   (Spending *was* to run out Sunday *if POTUS had not signed*.)  So there's a positive.
@aefr95658001 Booker.
CORY BOOKER:  after speaking, said he is leaving the hearing in protest. (He waited 3 hours, spoke for 22 minutes.) https://t.co/SSnyeznZmF
*Multiple members of press corps break out the protein/granola bars*
@jake_zuckerman @SteveLemongello yeah that sounds weird.
BOOKER: Talking now about how hard he worked to get on this committee, how he respects top GOP and Dems on committee.  He def has everyone's attention.  (It was smart start.)
FLAKE:  Just waved off his chance to speak at committee and is leaving the room now.  (assist from @caphilltrish who is next to me on that.)
Meantime, the House of Representatives heads swiftly for the exit.
@Cherteapet @amyklobuchar I think that is up to the director for the pool (which I think is CSPAN).  My guess is they think the person speaking is the most important element.   I wish for a site where anyone can see all the feeds themselves at anytime.
One truth remains: Senators cannot stop themselves from obsessing over and focusing on process.   Even in the most high-stakes debate.
Sorry - should have said Sen. Booker paying most attention of any Dem. Though most all listening now.  End of thread.
Seems fair to note that  Dems not consistently looking at Cruz as *he* speaks.  But looking more than GOP did w/ Klobuchar. Durbin, Klo, Coons listening now.  Also Klobuchar had a tone in her voice that was notable, unusual v. Cruz is more classic senator-in-speech tone.
WHY DONNELLY MATTERS: He, Heitkamp and Manchin all likely preferred (and some I KNOW preferred) Collins and Murkowski to announce first.    But he feels its worth it for him to put out his 'no' vote now.  Also he was a 'yes' on Gorsuch, so that is a change voters will ask about.
OK back to Donnelly's decision... see next tweet.
Both Grassley and Cornyn were talking with their sep. staff while Klobuchar was speaking (that's what she was noting, pausing for them to stop).    Cornyn was laughing with his staffer (See last tweet.)
@amyklobuchar That request for order by Dems did change things a little, Cornyn TIllis and Grassley were listening to Klobuchar.    But Cornyn now staring blankly ahead and just was laughign with staff member, Grassley again talking w/ staff.
@amyklobuchar Grassley himself just now was the issue now, interrupting unintentionally as he spoke sternly to a staff member. (Again, had not been watching Klobuchar.)
DONNELLY: A vulnerable Dem in a very Trump state is a no citing the allegations against Kavanaugh.... and lack of FBI investigation.  "The allegations made against Judge Kavanaugh are disturbing and credible. ... I believe the allegations should be investigated by the FBI."
Not a single GOP senator is consistently looking at Sen. @amyklobuchar as she speaks with clear emotion right now.      Some occasionally talking to each other, most looking down at papers or cell phones.  Cruz paying the most attention.
@CCRobIves @instapundit They never invited them. It was open seating for anyone who wanted to wait and line and made it through security (mags) check.
Things you can't get watching this Kavanaugh meeting on TV:  - it is COLD in here. (There must be some SCOTUS in the atmosphere...) (?) - The 30 audience seats are overwhelmingly occupied by women - The room is as high as wide.  If you step your view back, the senators look tiny
NOW: Durbin reads the letter from the American Bar Association requesting a delay in the Kavanaugh vote in order to allow for FBI investigation, "due process". the ABA writes.
NOW: Sen. Flake has left the hearing. Unclear why.   (A couple of GOPers have left, which feels like standard procedure during long speeches at a hearing.)
Note: Dems and GOP seem united in wanting to keep protesters out. Sources in both parties have told me this separately.  For different reasons, but both prefer no protesters.
Where are the protesters? Not here.  Which does raise qstns. This meeting is *required* to have public access.  But the few seats avail (small room) have been given to each party and so far have been designated to specific individuals they chose.
@lizzieohreally Whoa. Wow. Thanks Lizzie. Needed that.
What we have here, in this committee room, is an epic, incredibly important cultural clash.  Right now Lindsey Graham is also attempting personal catharsis.
GRAHAM: praising Joe Biden as a person, setting up his standards for SCOTUS nominations.
@MoElleithee Love Mr Rogers so much. And love Tom Hanks so much. But um... actually, this is making me feel weirder about the world. Which is saying a lot as I type this from the Judiciary Committee room.
LEAHY: "it feels like Alice in Wonderland around here.  ... This Judiciary Committee is no longer and independent of government. ... We are an arm, and a very weak arm, of the Trump White House. "
HATCH:  I know Judge Kavanaugh, I have known him a long time. It would be a crying shame to keep treating him as imposter or someone who can’t do this job.
NOTE: Sens. Leahy and Whitehouse have returned to the committee room.
NOW: empty seats where Dem lawmakers were. https://t.co/dYTgZPwoRs
DEM FEMALE LAWMAKERS stood in silent protest and now have left. https://t.co/YL48stOwUz
NOW: Dem female house members standing in protest in back of room. photos will come.
Interesting split in approach right now b/t @SenKamalaHarris, who has left this hearing in protest and Sen. @CoryBooker, who has stayed and is listening.
DEMS STILL AT HEARING:   Booker, Coons, Klobuchar, Durbin, Feinstein.   #AlreadyOffRails
NOW: Sev Dem Senators have left the hearing in protest.  Saw: Harris, Hirono, Whitehouse, Blumenthal.
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN JUDICIARY NOW. GOP has clearly instructed their clerk to:  - almost instantly move to votes before Democrats can object.   - keep reading the roll call over them if Dems attempt to speak - if Democrats pause to not vote, their vote will not be recorded.
COMMITTEE VOTE WHEN: Grassley is now having committee vote that vote should occur at 1:30 p ET.
Motion to subpoena Mark Judge is rejected.  10-11.
DEM's FIRST MOTION: The are requesting the committee subpoena Mark Judge.
ENTERING JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ROOM: Large contingent (relative to size of room) of  House Democratic female  lawmakers.  Among them @DWStweets (Wasserman-Schultz).
NOW: At Judic. Unknown:  - If every senator will speak - If Dems will raise some procedural motions/ blocking/protest techniques (prediction: they will) - If the public (protesters) will be allowed in room.  Now known: Kavanaugh will pass committee with a recommendation/
FLAKE IS A YES (as you may have seen):  Says he could not determine that Kavanaugh was guilty of accusation.  "What I do know is that our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence to the accused, absent corroborating evidence. That is what binds us to the rule of law"
OK, leaving this stairwell where I found good wifi and going home.
MCCONNELL statement now:   "It would be imprudent, unfair, and unjust to delay proceedings even further on the basis of uncorroborated allegations which have been weaponized by others at the last minute for political purposes. "  Shorter: They are going for confirmation by Tues.
*KAVANAUGH* TIMING.  THUNE: just told me if they win on the Saturday procedural vote , he expects the Monday cloture vote would be in the afternoon, not 1a.  (1a is the earliest possible.)  (Corrects misspelling that occurred while walking.) https://t.co/1eHejFLNJq
Senator Collins has left the building.  Politely gave no comment ("it's good to see you, but...") . Though she did confirm to me there is no decision from her yet on Kavanaugh.   And that's a wrap for this day.  cc: @ericawerner @pkcapitol @StevenTDennis @JasJWright
KAVANAIGH TIMING.  THUNE: just told me if they win on the Saturday procedural vote , he expects the Monday cloture vote would be in the afternoon, not 1a.  (1a is the earliest possible.)
BREAKING: Sen GOP plans first floor vote on Kavanaugh for Saturday, 12 noon.    That will be procedural vote.  Unclear if GOP has 50.  Committee vote to happen tomorrow 9:30 as planned.
CONFIRMED: Sen Wicker says he thinks they are moving toward votes on Kavanaugh.
NOW, SPOTTED: prosecutor Rachel Mitchell leaving GOP senate meeting
NOW: the reporters waiting to talk w GOP senators play a classic game of guessing which exits which senators will use.
MANCHIN: we are all undecided.
MANCHIN, after exiting meeting w Collins, Murkowski, Flake: I have nothing to say. We are friends.   What did he think of the hearing?: "I thought both were credible"
Now: Collins, Murkowski, Flake and Manchin are meeting.  Can confirm.
THUNE: I expect the committee vote to happen tomorrow.
SEN KYL (former Kavanaugh sherpa) to me: "I assume the committee vote happens tomorrow" but added he wanted to collect his thoughts and go to full GOP meeting.
NOW: waiting for GOP senators to come to a come-to-Jesus meeting about Kavanaugh.
FEINSTEIN:  I did not leak Blasey Ford's letter.  (Later) CORNYN: I believe you but did your staff leak it? FEINSTEIN: I do not believe my staff would do that.  But did not ask.   (Later) FEINSTEIN:  the staff didn't leak, I did ask.
SASSE makes a move to ask last of GOP questions.   Uses that time to get Kavanaugh to talk about closed session w/ the committee.    And he answers questions, which is another thing I don't think I've seen. Open discussion of what was/was not asked in closed session.
GRASSLEY INTERSTITIAL.
Right now prosecutor Rachel Mitchell is like a designated hitter than ANY member of a baseball team can chose to use at any time.   But ends up on the bench.   (What's she doing? Listening and taking notes of everything. )
AND NOW: Orrin Hatch is using his time.
KAVANAUGH APOLOGIZES: to @SenAmyKlobuchar for asking her a question (was a sharp question) rather than answering her question.
She's still here! Rachel Mitchell has best seat in the place. https://t.co/krjYaV2mh6
ADD TO THE "NEVER SEEN THAT" before file.   Klobuchar (second ask): "Have you ever had so much to drink you couldn't remember part of what happened..."  Pause.    Klob: Have you? Kavanaugh: Have *you*, senator?
Now for another Grassley interstitial.
CORNYN: introduced Kavanaugh at his first confirmation hearing... in 2004.
Cornyn, emotional: I can't think of more embarrassing scandal since the McCarthy hearings.    I'm afraid we've lost that (sense of decency).
Spotted in hearing room now during Kavanaugh testimony: @SenJoniErnst
Whitehouse: let's let things settle a little after that.
GRAHAM, pointing finger at Dems, veins showing on face: "What you want to do is destroy this guys life!!!!!"    To Kavanaugh: "You’ve got nothing to apologize for."  To America: "This is the most unethical sham since I’ve been in politics."
IF you are not watching the Kavanaugh hearing, now is a time to tune in.   This is extraordinary stuff. (Graham unleashing now.)  https://t.co/Y0XgzD9RpJ
To voice a potentially controversial thought:  I don't understand either a)  Republicans argument for not allowing  some basic FBI investigation/question asking or b) why Democrats believe it will be potentially earth shaking.
This Durbin-Kavanaugh back and forth is most animated of the day.
Grassley be Grassley.
Kavanaugh: Says he has interviewed with the committee about Ford's allegations (twice) and Ramirez' allegations and Swetnick's allegations.
Kavanaugh: is making it clear he sees his entire future on the line.   That he either becomes the next Supreme Court *justice* or he loses all he cares about, including coaching and teaching.
Mitchel clarifies to Kavanaugh definition of sexual behavior in this hearing includes: "rubbing or grinding genitals against someone clothed or unclothed."    And that it applies whether or not it was sexually motivated.  He says he understands.
NOW: Rachel Mitchell is giving Kavanaugh same ground rules she gave Christine Blasey Ford.
Kavanaugh: is making it clear he sees his entire future on the line.   That he either becomes the next Supreme Court nominee or he loses all he cares about, including coaching and teaching.
Renate.
Meantime, Kavanaugh now moving a few women in audience to tears, as he tears up about his family memories.
KAVANAUGH: Dr. Ford's claim is not only uncorroborated, it is refuted.   Except, Ford's friend Leland Keyser did not refute Ford's story, she simply said she did not remember it.  Keyser went to trouble to make that point clear later.
Wow.  Kavanaugh: These two weeks have been a political hit fueled by pent up frustration about Trump, revenge for the Clintons. This is a circus.   I usually am optimistic but today I fear for the future.
Kavanaugh: this has destroyed my family and my good name.
Wow. Kavanaugh directly takes on Democrats in front of him: "Some of you were lying in wait..." to attack me.
Thought: Regardless of who is telling the truth this entire hearing is one giant look at how gender dynamics remain firmly in place.    The man is expected to be strong in tone, indignant, even angry if he is to be believed. The woman questioned  as if being manipulated by others
KAVANAUGH: starting with clear tone of outrage, indignation at his treatment and accusation against him.
Kavanaugh testimony about to start. https://t.co/AkXhrne4Qr
ALSO spotted in audience: Marjorie Dannenfelser of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List.  Currently sitting next to abortion rights activist @Alyssa_Milano (who offered Dannenfelser a snack... America we *can* come together!).
FROM AUDIENCE (lawmakers, Alyssa Milano): "Thank you Dr. Ford!" as she leaves
Rails = on edge of coming off from senators.  Blasey Ford attorney "Can we be excused?"
MITCHELL: I have no further questions.  This ends the GOP questions for Blasey Ford.
NOW: Blasey Ford struggling to hold back emotion as @SenBooker calls her actions heroic and important.
FROM HATCH SPOX Matt Whitlock to me: "Hatch uses “attractive” to describe personalities, not appearances. If you search his past quotes you’ll see he’s used it consistently for years for men and women he believed has compelling personalities."
@arlenparsa @senorrinhatch Highly suspect it's coming somewhere.
@tcd004 wow. *blush*
@rorydalton Me too. Not sure yet what they will be!
Yes, monitoring what @senorrinhatch reportedly said in hallway... but waiting to hear it.    (And have asked his office for comment.)
WHERE TO WATCH the Kavanaugh/ Blasey Ford hearing without noise, vitriol.  Just smart thought about the substance and drama.  PBS NEWSHOUR!!  So happy to work here during testing times.  https://t.co/fjxYqaeOTO
Blumenthal's words to Blasey Ford about how surely he believes her and why he believes her evoked tears from @SenGillibrand and @RepMaloney in hearing room.
NOTE: It is entirely unclear what the rules are here.  Including whether anyone *can* object.  And, as Graham now has interrupted with his own questions twice (after yielding his time), whether that can happen.
Now in hearing room, another female member of Congress: @RepSusanDavis
Democrats are making a point of each thanking Blasey Ford.
AND, the WH emails reporters a quote from Biden from 1991:  "I think most believe that lie detector tests are not—are not—the appropriate way to get to the truth.”   Which does qstn polygraphs.  But also shows WH doesn't want this polygraph considered too seriously.
OH BOY. You knew these senators could not stay silent this whole time.  Graham: pushing back about when polygraph administered, trying to prosecute against Klobuchar.
OK, Grassley now is accepting the polygraph as part of the record.
GRASSLEY AGAIN interrupting to defend GOP (as willing to fly to California).  Dems withholding fire on that.  And now Grassley seems confused over whether to put polygraph results on record.
Hmm. GOP's Mitchell seems trying to question whether Blasey Ford was sincere in initially telling committee she had fear of flying/why didn't want to schedule Washington interview.  This is the longest line of questioning about her credibility, yet, not about accusation.
NOW. GOP's Mitchell asked Blasey Ford if she had other environmental experiences that may have contributed to her PTSD, anxiety?  Blasey Ford: said she couldn't think of anything, certainly nothing like this incident.
GRASSLEY: made a risky move there.  Felt he had to defend himself and the GOP's handling of Blasey Ford's accusations.  But he went outside the format to do that (as chairman he can do what wants) and opened up possibility for things to get off rails b/t senators later.
@hedgehogkibble Unclear at this point.
Cornyn has stepped out of the room.
THIS IS THE MAP: GOP's Mitchell just asked Blasey Ford about.  They passed out copies to press. (Which, note were clearly ready for us but had not gone to Dems prequestioning.) https://t.co/8pJ3Eg1Q3y
UNUSUAL. AS GOP side asks Blasey Ford to look at specific evidence/docs, Dems ask to see it as well. (Reminder, the point of this is for Senators to get information.)  Confusing back and forth (Grassley mishearing his staff) and now GOP passing out docs to Dems.
The music/noise seems to be a key line of questioning for Mitchell...
KEY MOMENT: Blasey Ford said the thing she remembers the most pointedly is "the laughter" the indelible uproarious laughter of Kavanaugh and Judge, laughing as she was under attack.  (Many teared-up people in audience during this.)
OK MITCHELL'S second set of questions, summary: - Blasey Ford: had alcohol or medication prior to going  country club to swim. - Blasey Ford says Kavanaugh + Mark Judge were extremely inebriated at the party and others were not. - Blasey Ford: no tv or music playing downstairs
NOW: It sounds like Mitchell is beginning her substantive questions after going over basic documents GOP is raising.
FEINSTEIN: what you are telling us is this could not be a case of mistaken identity?  BLASEY FORD: Absolutely not.
SO. This is going to be a very odd ping pong of Mitchell for five minutes, then a Dem, then Mitchell, then a Dem.   Grassley asked Mitchell if it was ok to move on as his 5 minutes ran out.    Which is yet another unusual thing here.  Grassley usually is more blunt about time up
MITCHELL: Begins GOP questions by telling Blasey Ford she is sorry for what she is going through and noting she feels terrified, trying to calm her.  Then starts going through some key documents.  It is a calm tone on both sides.
@elainaplott Where is this? Dirksen? Hart?
BLASEY FORD: "This was an extremely hard thing for me to do, but I felt that I couldn't not do it."
Senators as Blasey Ford says "I believed he was going to kill me" https://t.co/LkmDCNmQcg
Senators as Blasey Ford says "I believed he was going to kill me" https://t.co/XMu3BKiULZ
Taking the oath https://t.co/mt6sEewMeS
Blasey Ford is sworn in. https://t.co/K32hUsi6zD
GRASSLEY: We have attempted to reach other accusers - Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick - but their attorneys are not cooperating.    We have asked 8 times to speak w/ Ramirez, 6 times w/ Swetnick.
The press has 45 or so seats. (Half of the non-dias room.)   So the committee has made an effort to really accomodate the massive media interest.
WHO ELSE IS IN THE ROOM:  40 seats for an audience.   -10-16 of these are divided up by each party.  (This is where lawmakers Sen. Gillibrand, Sheila Jackson-Lee, C. Maloney and Jackie Speier are sitting).   - Then 15-20 seats for the witness.
WHO IS WITH BLASEY FORD:  Attorneys Debra Katz and Michael Bromwich are sitting with her at the table.   Behind her is attorney Lisa Banks and Blasey's friend Keith Koegler who submitted an affadavit that Blasey Ford told him about the attack prior to Kavanaugh's nomination.
WHERE TO WATCH: PBS NewsHour, for straight thoughtful news coverage.  And a very good stream.  https://t.co/fjxYqaeOTO
Prosecutor Mitchell was one of the first in the room.  She has a small table for herself to the left of the witness table, just under GOP Dias. https://t.co/v0V0dayo4R
WILL THERE BE PROTESTERS?:  Maybe not. I am told that the small number of seats for the public have been divided by political party. That if there are extra past that, then the public can use them.   It is very unclear how many or if all of these are ticketed.
GOP Senators arrived in a large group (except Mike Lee who had come in earlier).
Sig correction: she is here.  But that was a friend of hers I watched walk by. https://t.co/bw59pxmiyx
No one has been able to tell me where the line is for the public.
BLASEY FORD is here: I watched her walk past nearly the entire press corps w no one else realizing it was her but one still photographer.
@JohnLGC @tylersmoody @NewsHour @avidindoorsman @ELBordeaux Yes. Literally dreamed last night I was on a camping trip in beautiful nature marred by a tv set in a tree that would not turn off.  Found myself apologizing to everyone.   Sad!
@munderw341 That means a great deal. Thank you!
@martineieio @NewsHour You are READING my mind. I woke up today almost giddy that I had a shot at talking Farm Bill, Opioids Deal, FAA Reauthorization and Hurricane Florence funding. Been reporting on this all week. But Kavanaugh eclipsed it all.
@tylersmoody @NewsHour Omg very unsure that i need a LisaDNews podcast.  And def sure it could not mirror the American Sauce specialness (word?).    CC: @avidindoorsman @JohnLGC @ELBordeaux
@RickHenry10 Just a shame. It was a legitimately very funny video. Made me laugh in a ridiculous (not in a good way) week.
Gloves are off on this one. Top McConnell staffer --&gt; https://t.co/5w7nDiPVLG
This, America.  One of the best sports anchors (+friends) in the south posted a video of univ. cheerleaders giving hilariously serious unimpressed looks at rival univ's (SC) cheerleaders.  And b/c of where we are, where comments are, he feels forced to delete it. https://t.co/gHpX4V01Qp
KAVANAUGH on his roommate's account that he was frequently incoherently drunk...:  "Like most people in college, I went to parties and had beers, but that's -- not an accurate description in my view."  https://t.co/suvPJXxWy7
THIS: actual information.  Redacted Judiciary Committee interview w/ Kavanaugh.  https://t.co/suvPJXxWy7
!!BREAKING!!!: I may ask for delay in Rosenstein hearing b/c i don't want anything that will conflict with Kavanaugh hearing.  and THIS: My preference would be to keep him.
Q8: Are you planning to fire Rosenstein?  Trump: we had a good talk, said he never said it, he has a lot of respect for me. He was very nice. We'll see.  He's member of the Trump Administration in that sense and we'll see.  I may call Rod tonight or tomorrow to ask for delay.
And Q7 is about the Chinese. What evidence does he have that the Chinese meddled in  election?   Trump: There is evidence.  (He doesn't give more specifics.)  Talks about
Wow. This is an epic unleashing of Trump saying how his past of facing allegations of sexual misconduct is absolutely affecting his thinking.
NOW: Trump is unleashing on the headlines of sexual misconduct that have been alleged against him.
NOW Trump: I was accused by, I believe it was four women, four or five women, who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me. We caught them and the main stream media refused to cover it.   I've never met these people.
Q6: You said that if what she said were as bad as she claims, her parents would have reported it...   Trump: ... I'm not saying they had to report it, it's a very personal thing.
Q5 FOLO: You have given benefit of the doubt to all men, why is that?  Trump: I've known them a long time, some disappointed with, others there are judges that are pretty weak. But I never saw them do anything wrong.
Q5 FOLO: is there a situation in which you would withdraw Kavanaugh?  Trump: if I thought he was guilty yes.  ... If we brought George Washington here, the Democrats would vote against him. He may have had some, I think accusations against him. Didn't he...?
Q5: To clarify, do you think these women are liars?  Trump: I don't know about today's person. I was busy with China, with many other countries. As far as other women are concerned, I'm going to see what happens. I will be watching.
Mr. President, Call on @Yamiche !!!!
Q4: (About why president seems to regularly defend the accused and criticize accusers)  Trump: You know there are two sides to allegations. And hopefully tomorrow we will hear testimony. It is possible I will hear that and I will change my mind. That is possible.
Something new.   @Acosta just suggested that the president call on a female reporter, after calling four men in a row.   Trump: What does that mean?  Acosta reiterated.   Trump: Fine with me, doesn't make a diffrence to me.
Q3: Will you be more proactive against Cuba?  Trump: I have been very proactive against Cuba. Obama gave them a pass.  I've ended much, most of it.
Q2 FOLO: you have daughters, do you understand why a victim of sexual assault may not report at the time.  Trump: I will only say... 36 years + there is no charge.  Then you have this other con artist - Avenatti - come out with this other beauty today. Senators will have to vote.
Q2 to POTUS: Are you saying all three women are liars? Anything that could make you withdraw Kavanaugh?  Trump: I won't get into that, I will only say he is one of the highest quality individuals I've ever met. And these are all false accusations - to me - false accusations.
Q1 to Trump: President Bush asked the FBI to look at Hill allegations in 1991, why this WH not do that?   Trump: Here there was nothing to investigate, didn't know location, town, year, anything. I think when you really look at it, it won't change Dems minds. They are con artists
NOW: President Trump begins taking questions at newser. And says "we have plenty of time".
@SenatorZero @NewsHour It's a very good point. But I do feel like it is fair to ask for it not to be so very brimming over with news and eye-popping storylines.
I feel like I have to make some impossible choices about what from the firehose of news and drama today I convey in my time on @newshour tonight.
GRAHAM on Swetnick   "This is saying Kavanaugh was a serial rapist in high school" and if he was, it would have happened again later. Nothing in his background to make that believable.  He also repeats WH/Kavanaugh phrasing of this being in "the Twilight Zone", "over the top".
@kenblair75 No, not in current environment I'd argue.   Something that should be easy? Yes. Expected? Not necessarily.
ICYMI @JeffFlake today: I do not believe that a claim of sexual assault is invalid bc a 15-year-old girl didn’t promptly report the assault to authorities, as POTUS said just 2 days ago. How uninformed + uncaring do you have to be to say things like that, much less believe them?
GOOD NEWS: one potential crisis seems to be averted.  TRUMP overheard by WH pool just now: “We’re going to keep the government open.”   Note: Speaker Ryan's office took the rare step of emailing that WH pool account to reporters (who have been asking them about this ALOT).
AND NOW: we have the results of Blasey Ford's polygraph, as released by her legal team.  https://t.co/y5JaB0QfhF  (h/t @courtneyknorris )
NOW - Dem attempt to block Kavanaugh vote: @SenJeffMerkley is asking a federal court to intervene and stop the vote, arguing the process has defied the Constitution.   He's filing lawsuit here in DC today.  Any precedent for this? he was asked. "No. We are in uncharted waters."
(EXTRA) WEIRD DAY. Many many oddities today, among them is this Sen. Merkley "pen and pad", so named because tv cameras are not allowed.  Yet, he brought very large posters as visuals.   (Still photographers are helped, but still.) https://t.co/oOBYoVCC76
ALSO NOW (yes it's wild here today): Sen Merkley announcing he has filed a lawsuit challenging Trump admin's lack of release of some Kavanaugh documents as violating balance of powers and unconstitutional. https://t.co/FifsBlNaqh
GRASSLEY: also lashed out at Avanetti as a lawyer who seems to be supporting pornography and is running for president.
THIS. NOW, new.   Question to Grassley: "Should there be a second hearing" (given the new allegations)?  Grassley: "we are taking this step by step. Ask me Thursday night."
GRASSLEY now on latest Kavanaugh accusations (Avanetti): "our investigators have a contact, they are on it."  Says he can't comment yet, as staff looks at it.
NEW: Judiciary has posted Kavanaughs's prepares remarks for tomorrow.  Under two pages.   Read: https://t.co/R43aywQgOl
OK lots of news here on House side: - Ryan and mult GOP sources say POTUS has committed to sign spending bill.  = NO SHUTDOWN - opioid crisis bill agreed to last night to get final passage in H this week. - House almost certain to leave this week, not return until post elex (!)
@SatanHangTen @NewsHour @johnyangtv @WmBrangham Very close. Just reverse it.
Also unusual - now on the Sentae floor, praise for how bipartisan the Senate has operated, how McConnell and Schumer came together to make something happen. (The songwriter's bill).  @SenAlexander https://t.co/PgNYvKNcTw
@codytfenwick True. *SH at self*
BREAK FROM THE POLITICS: @senorrinhatch now on Senate floor talking about music, and how grateful he is for it.    (B/c of the songwriter's bill. But this is a general shout out to music as well.)
UN Sec Gen Guerres now, with Pres. Trump a few feet away: We are all proud citizens of our countries ... but we are all also citizens of the world.
NEW: GOP source with knowledge says the Judiciary Committee has reached out to Deborah Rameriz for a statement and any evidence or information she wants to submit, but has not heard back from her or her attorneys.   (She alleges Kavanaugh thrust his genitalia at her in college)
Phrase to note in Trump speech at U.N. now. He argued for "security without apology".
@j9duffy He is definitely reading off prompter now.
I find myself wondering how the president's speaking speed right now meshes with his other speeches of the past.   Perhaps just feels like an all-time slow pace? (B/c my brain is recovering from past few days of news.)
@munderw341 @dankennedy_nu @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff Oh gosh - don't lose faith!  Civil discourse is not dead, I promise.  Was there a recent time that we didn't air a relevant view/position/side?? Believe me we spend A LOT of time thnking about and working on that.
TRUMP NOW: "We defend many of these nations for nothing and then they repay us by raising oil prices. Not good."   ... "We are not going to put up w/ it, these horrible prices much longer."
NOW: we have the extra on-script @realDonaldTrump at the U.N.  One sign of this (aside from his attention to prompter) - his pace. He is slower, more careful, when he is being more careful.
@nvrqt @RiveraGrrl @MichaelAvenatti @JudyWoodruff @NewsHour @Yamiche Thanks for the tweet. Until an accusation has names and/or specifics attached, it's just rumor or a heads up. Not yet news.
@LouisVigorita That you that means a great great deal
I feel like this is vaguely a potential early scene in the Hunger Games.   Sorry still a little in a dark place. https://t.co/yhvvHbO440
MCCONNELL NOW: I want to make it clear, Judge Kavanaugh will be voted on up or down, on the Senate floor, in the near future.
MCCONNELL now on how Dems have handled Kavanaugh accusations:  "... or does it sound like a choreographed" effort to inflict maximum damage at key time.
WHAT TODAY LOOKS LIKE ON CAP HILL: 1. Protesters everywhere, and with nee strategies, including women telling personal assault stories in staff offices.   2. Cap Police ready, most everyone on double shifts.  3. Also two-year-olds now involved. https://t.co/cFrGhWhO3t
CONFUSED IN THE KAVANAUGH FIGHT?: I think THIS may be the clearest look at the allegations against him and the evidence supporting and questioning those allegations.   (You tell me - I did it to I un-confuse myself.)  https://t.co/nrcKJzkP1K
NEW: Kavanaugh letter to Senate Judiciary, "I will not be intimidated into withdrawing".  He says he looks forward to testifying Thursday.

NEW - KAVANAUGH: From Committee source.  GOP has replied to Ford's team stating they are pleased on agreement for THursday hearing.   BUT four things are "non-negotiable": 1. which witnesses called 2. how many 3. order of witnesses and 4. who asks questions.

ICYMI: game of chicken ramps up, @ChuckGrassley extended deadline for prof blasey ford to respond to GOP offer on Kavanaugh hearing to 10p tonjght.  If no response he indicated he could call vote Monday.  (V unclear if Collins, Flake would be ok w that.)
NEW, BREAKING HERE, Kavanaugh: top GOP source w knowledge tells me Prof Blasey Ford's team has told them they will not make tonight's COB deadline to respond to the GOP offer and may not respond tonight at all.
The Senate Radio-TV Gallery sent this out b/c technically the Monday hearing has not yet been cancelled. (Though no one expects it to stand.)

@StevenTDennis When two weeks in Trump time is like 10 human years.
@SenatorCollins ... Not transcribing, but Collins went out to raise her doubts about the timing and why Democrats did not make the allegations public for so long.    6
@SenatorCollins ... Collins: "So, to me it is Monday's the preferred date since that has been out there 8 days, but I don't see a problem with delaying until Wednesday or even Thursday. " 5
@SenatorCollins More @SenatorCollins: ... "I do think both she and Judge Kav. need to testify under oath, but I believe we should attempt to make this as comfortable a process for her as possible. And indeed the committee has offered her a public session or a private session ... " 4
@SenatorCollins More @SenatorCollins: ...   "My advice to the Senate leaders is (Ford) has said she could be there on Thursday and we should offer her Weds. or Thurs. I don't really think that is critical as long as it happens next week. ...   3
@SenatorCollins Collins:... "I thought the president's tweet was completely incoherent and wrong."   "I think we should try to accmdate Prof. Ford w/in the realm of reasonableness. Obviously, she came public 8 days before the Mon. date of the hearing but now she is saying she can't come Mon... 2
--&gt;@SenatorCollins REAX to Trump in full:  "I was appalled by the president's tweet. First of all, we know that allegations of sexual assault - I'm not saying that's what happened - we know that allegations of sexual assault are one of the most unreported crimes that exist...  1

@conncarroll @MarkBauer @NewsHour Thanks. Missed that @AJentleson was asking exclusively for criminal investigation but am looking more closely now.
@MarkBauer @NewsHour @conncarroll FYI, literally just FYI. (I like the Twitter debates, but not being in them so much, I admit.)
This this this.    Especially for anyone who wants a Trump/Senate/Kavanaugh break. https://t.co/7dFcCccwFY
@czarped @NewsHour It is actually both sides out of step with the normal process, whether both sides want to admit it here.
@czarped @NewsHour I couldn't agree more with the idea that stories are not always even and often there can be a side, or a party that is causing the problems.  But not in this case. GOP is refusing a standard FBI background check. Dems are refusing to join committee staff interviews.
@Spartacussin Thank you for this.  I'm not one who believes in false equivalence and do call a spade a spade. But I do need to give specifics, you're right. GOP: Is blocking a standard FBI background investigation DEMS: are refusing to cooperate in committee calls with potential witnesses.
@cannotrunfast @NewsHour Huh.
@CharlieWiseCPA @iMakeArtifacts This is how the Republicans on Senate Judiciary understand the situation. You have it straight. (Though Dems think the Senate Judiciary chairman can request this kind of check - but that's not clear.)
I do understand your point, but her question was "they're not conducting the kind of investigation that Democrats are saying is necessary?"...  But will try to get in more specifics on this in future.  Transcript: https://t.co/OrsIN41XhF https://t.co/yPYbbra1a6
@KevinFloyd @craigmelvin @PBS @NewsHour That is top of my interview dream list.

FASCINATING re: KAVANAUGH options:  Sen. Historian Betty Koed tells @NewsHour that while letting outside counsel ask ?s at a hearing is not common, it is has happened.  She cites, cases 1920s - 1960s (Teapot Dome was one.)  Cc: @SenatorCollins @ChuckGrassley  Via @juliepercha
KAVANAUGH STATE OF PLAY - short:  Neither side is following standard procedure in getting testimony, investigating the allegations. Both are claiming the other is the one out of line.  And this is why Americans are so angry at their lawmakers.
FEINSTEIN NOW: just told us she wanted to get an outside investigator to review Prof. Ford's claim (she was then anonymous), but Feinstein said she was told that had to go through the Rules Committee and she feared it would be made public as a result.
What's on Rubio's mind this morning: https://t.co/sBYEy0kI4t

Wow. @realDonaldTrump has just asked for declassification of key docs in the Carter Page investigation (and wiretape of Page), which GOP say was motivated by anti-Trump bias and FBI, Intel community sharply denies.
WHAT @SenatorCollins will see when she walks out her door in a few minutes.  Yes, today is a little nuts.  And she may be the public figure most focused on by the public on this at moment. https://t.co/gsqHjXtrjo
NOW: McConnell on Senate floor defending Kavanaugh and railing against Democrats, repeatedly pointing out 11th-hour timing.
NEW GRASSLEY'S OFFICE to me just now :  - They hope to reach Ms. Ford today or tomorrow to hear her story directly. - They will go back to Judge Kavanaugh and talk with him. - Then see what next - they aren't committing to hearings yet. (Though widely expected by others.)
@fakefakenews12 I want to do it more - but @Twitter does not have direct way to share audio. Grrr.
HEAR FULL AUDIO of Hatch w/ a few of us reporters in last few minutes.  Includes Kavanaugh insisting he wasn't at the party, and how Hatch sees the underlying accusation vs. Kavanaugh today.  https://t.co/Fgq0SBhKOa
@igorbobic Posting audio in a sec, stand by.
I ASKED HATCH - when he pointed out his belief that Ford was "mixed up" about the party -  whether he allowed for the possibility that Kavanaugh may have been too inebriated to remember himself?  His answer: Kavanaugh said that's not true.
HATCH just told us two things: 1. He spoke w Kavanaugh an hour ago and Kavanaugh told him he was not even at that party (we did folo up but that's all we got)  2. Hatch, when asked, sd if allegations were true would be hard for senators not to consider who Kav is today - a gd man
They just never showed that part. https://t.co/bl8weQK75p
FOLKS, I believe GOP ldrhip has united on a response for the day (if not what next) on Kavanaugh. Two key points:  -  Allegations are "serious" -  Treat this fairly/look closely  (See Cornyn, Blunt, led off by @KellyannePolls this am.)
Highest ranking GOP official yet to say Kavanaugh allegations need time - Sen. Roy Blunt.   https://t.co/QBFT4ZsL0J
Also now: sort of sad crowd of reporters (I was one) outside @SenatorCollins office waiting/hoping she comes out ... (we later learned she went in a different way.) our job is so weird. https://t.co/8U5QXOhQJe

@KDbyProxy It is an interesting point to raise. And not at all disputing it but there is a difference in the starting population. Today's letter was open to ALL alum's of Houlton-A (all years, may not have known Ford).  Last week's was just women who actually knew Kavanaugh.
@tangomoon700 @NewsHour THANK YOU for sharing this.  I hope you know that you ARE incredibly strong, this tweet shows that so clearly.
NEW: All Democrats on Senate Judiciary signed letter asking for delay in Kavanaugh votes.   TIMING NOTE: Dems say "staff-level examination should not go forward until (the FBI officials) have completed their review."  https://t.co/F9d8b9qBzk
NEW: Over 100 alumnae of Houlton-Arms have signed a letter saying they believe and support Dr. Ford. (Note most are recent grads, a few attended in 80s.)  https://t.co/5FwjTO4hmq
NEW (re)statement from the White House, from spox Kerri Kupec: "On Friday, Judge Kavanaugh ‘categorically and unequivocally’ denied this allegation. This has not changed. Judge Kavanaugh and the White House both stand by that statement."
NEW*: @SenatorCollins spoke with Judge Kavanaugh on the phone for an hour today.   Her office not saying anything about the discussion.
ICYMI (last 30 min.) - Kavanaugh allegations:  Ronan Farrow reports woman alleges that at a HS party, Kavanaugh held her down, covered her mouth, attempted to force himself on her  Kavanaugh: “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation."
@milesobrien @DLNHLGSN @NewsHour @PBS @JudyWoodruff @sarajust @Yamiche @WmBrangham @johnyangtv @IAmAmnaNawaz @nickschifrin @JeffreyBrown Miles can you please pose and take a pic we can photo shop into this?
EASY BUTTON: 377-20 House easily  gives final passage to $146 billion spending bill that funds Vets, military construction, nuclear programs and Congress itself.
Whoa. https://t.co/TVcm6y78rk
@JohnLGC @RonanFarrow Hmm. But define "apparently".
This is a great thread. https://t.co/xEq1WmsXIr
SHORTER: Cong. Republicans have a detailed plan to avoid a shutdown but are waiting to do it for some reason.  Cong. Dems are giving no details but are NOT waiting to signal completely unspecified allegations related somehow  Kavanaugh.
IN SUMMARY TODAY: - Congress plans a punt on controversial spending, w/ partial CR to Dec. 7. - BUT won't pass it until week of Sept. 25 ?! - SO  Trump could get shutdown-y, threaten not to sign. - Also Kavanaugh weirdness as Dems raise unspecified concern from unspecified person
@ChuckGrassley TRUMP NOT ALONE among GOP leaders in questioning Puerto Rico death toll, in other words.
NOW!: @ChuckGrassley told reporters he doesn't want to comment on the president's tweet but that he also notes the difference in original death toll reported and the estimate now.   "I'd like to know why that is - and I think the president is in a position to find out", he sai.
HEADS UP: House GOP now focusing election message on "running on results".  Expect to hear that word more in next few days (including today at leadership newser).
HOUSE is now going home today, instead of tomorrow.  (DC not in hurricane path this weekend, FYI.)  #1-dayWorkweek
ROS-LEHTINEN: told us, about Trump, it is a "warped-mind that would turn this statistic (of hurricane deaths) into 'fake news'."  The Hispanic GOP lawmaker says it's a "new low, and that's saying something.".
NOW:  GOP Rep. Ros-Lehtinen told a few of us Trump's Puerto Rico tweet was "mind-boggling", that the facts are known and she believes those deaths happened. Also used the phrase "warped mind" about the idea of what he tweeted.
WHERE IS FLORENCE GOING?: I covered hurricanes for many years - the best with the phenomenal @biancaboone - and this is my secret favorite chart that tells you everything.  https://t.co/H9Pn0pL16l?

@joeyschu42 @peterwtrue @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff @sarajust You guys win, based just on the beer drinkers v wine drinkers subplot.
@peterwtrue @joeyschu42 @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff @sarajust I don't mess around, that's true.  Though Diplomacy is probably my great love, truth be told.
IN NEXT MINUTES: our piece on the intense battle over Kavanaugh in the Missouri Senate race.  Including some fascinating characters, like @StudentsforLife and @SharkFu.  Buckle up for a full plate of interesting on-ground reality.   Soon I'm @NewsHour
THIS. A first. Every @NewsHour corrspndnt w/ fearless leaders @JudyWoodruff and @sarajust.  We were having as much fun as it appears.  Love this team. https://t.co/zlQy48ofuy
@ocasey321 @NewsHour @PBS @JudyWoodruff @sarajust @Yamiche @WmBrangham @johnyangtv @IAmAmnaNawaz @nickschifrin @JeffreyBrown Not biting on that invitation to a Twitter battle, but do want to say that photo is real.
In case you are confused... https://t.co/kwgqdSm3P3
NOW: @SpeakerRyan's advice to next speaker: "Get the team to agree to the vision... hold the team to a timeline and execute"... "that's what we did" he notes.  (On some things, yes, but huh. Health care? Farm bill? Not so much.)
ICYMI - One senator from Maine is a No on Kavanaugh. https://t.co/QelpEVjfd2
ONE TAKEAWAY from #Florence so far:  This proves indisputably that Univ. of South Carolina is far smarter than Clemson.
I really like this stuff and somehow excitement not yet coming. https://t.co/YMngqaxqCk
When you get the assignment to sit back and listen to these smart ladies talk Midterms, Obama, Beto and Cruz, it's a good day.  (@Shawna ) https://t.co/tqEZNtPruv
@deanpwright @amyewalter Thank you for a great tweet!! Cc @Shawna
NOW - KAVANAUGH: @clairemc was asked by a cmpgn volunteer about how she'd vote on Kavanaugh. She said some things are giving her pause, esp campaign finance.  And overall - (see video)... https://t.co/A4NB5zxp2Q
IN MISSOURI: here's how the left is organizing. They are serious. A conf w workshops on campaigning, media, money, all aimed at ppl new to politics opposing moderates and conservatives. Will see how they feel about @clairecmc. https://t.co/usy5ImDR5d
LEAVING PROTESTERS, SENATORS BEHIND: heading to Missouri to cover the ground war over Kavanaugh and pressure from all sides on @clairecmc. So good to get out of D.C.  (Was in that hearing room ALOT.) https://t.co/LjMZAlQJko
@SaherMKhan Note: Have left hearing for our show.
@SaherMKhan 33. and 34. "Save health care!" "Democracy matters!" "Save health care!"
@SaherMKhan 32. "Keep Kavanaugh's hands off our bodies!"
@SaherMKhan 31. "Guns kill kids!! Kavanaugh is a puppet of the NRA! Stop killing our kids!!!"
GRASSLEY: Have you made any pre-committments, winks, nods or secret handshakes to the president, vice president or anyone in the WH indicating promises about how you would rule in any case related in any way to the Mueller investigation?  KAV: I have not.
@SaherMKhan 29. and 30. "Health care is a human right! Woo! Save Roe."
BLUMENTHAL: reasks the Kasowitz question - if spoke to anyone there about Mueller investgtn.    KAV: I don't recall anything like that.   BLUM: Do you know anyone at that firm?  KAV: Ed McNally.    BLUM: Talk to him about Mueller/special counsel investigation?  KAV: No.
BLUMENTHAL: So you are saying no, you havne't talked to anyone in the WH about Robert Mueller or the investigation...  KAV: you changed the question. Of course I know Mr. Mueller. But I've had no discussions of the kind that I think you are asking about.
BLUMENTHAL: Have you ever talked about the special counsel investigation w/ Don McGahn or anyone in the WH?  KAV: I'm not remembering anything like that. But of course in preparing for this hearing I spoke with people about many things.
@SaherMKhan 28. (quietly, as on way out) "Liar"
HUH.    Blumenthal just asked Kavanaugh if anyone showed him the 2003 abortion email yesterday.  Kavanaugh said he could not remember.  Which might not usually stand out, except Kavanaugh has shown he has an exceptional memory.
I am fangirling big time at these two bad ass reporters tweeting/RTing each other. https://t.co/Xz8Pvh36Of
@SaherMKhan 25. "Protect my daughters!" 26. (Couldn't make it out) 27. Sounded like "trouble" (?)
Incredible memory, verified. (Again.)  #Kavanaugh
NOW: The Catholic girls basketball team Kavanaugh coaches just enters and will be behind the judge during next bit. https://t.co/1RnG2Ont0T
NOW: Arguably one of the two strongest Dems to question Kavanaugh yesterday is getting his second round - Sen. @ChrisCoons
@SaherMKhan 24. "You have blood on your hands! You're a murderer!"
@SaherMKhan 23. "Why do you marginalize women and minorities, why do you do it?" (Note, fwiw, this was a white man.)
@SaherMKhan 21. "No (couldn't hear) should be able to nominate a lifetime precedent setter." 22. (There was more but overlapped w/ above) "We deserve a fair process!"
@SaherMKhan 16. "Our lives are on the lines (with) Kavanaugh." 17. and 18. together. "Save Roe, Vote no." 19. and 20. together (now). "Protect Roe!"
@SaherMKhan 12. "No one is immune to the law, vote no on kavanaugh"  13. "The system is corrupt, that’s why we disrupt, vote no" 14. "This is a stolen seat, this is a stolen seat"  15. "This is a stolen seat, this is a stolen seat"
Playing major catch-up here after chasing senators.  @SaherMKhan filled the gap:  8. "They show he’s going to ruin our country"  9. “Release the files, release the files, release the files (continuously) the people have a right to know!  10. and 11. (couldn't make out).
STRANGE BUT TRUE:  the @pbs @newshour team (me and ⁦@SaherMKhan⁩) equal HALF of all broadcasters, from any network, at Kavanaugh hrng now. (!) (??) https://t.co/PkY1DrctNR
THIS - THE DEAL W/ KAVANAUGH DOCS: Judic. GOP staff just told us... - Booker violated rules last pm b/c "racial profiling" email was then confidential. - He then requst'd permiss. for it to be public. - Committee + Bush team cleared it overnight. - So was NOT violation this am.
Softball....noun...(soft'-bal):  @LindseyGrahamSC asking Kavanaugh "Is there anything about this process that you'd improve? What could we do better?"
GRAHAM now: Most Americans after this hearing will have a dimmer view of the Senate, and rightly so.  #KavanaughConfirmationHearing
@BrendanBuck Sorry missing it. Asking Senate Judiciary if they can put it on the big screens here. Will let you know how that goes...
Protester 6. "Tell the truth! Tell the truth! 7. "Kavanaugh is a danger to the American way of life!"  Note: these two protesters were a return to the quick-aggressive-shout-then-more-calmly-leave-with-police type.
@abarmostlikely That wins best tweet of the day so far.
I asked MANCHIN about the newly-leaked Kavanaugh 2003 email about Roe v. Wade:   "I really don't have any comment."  He similarly said little to other Kavanaugh questions we asked.   Tho on NYT Op-Ed, he responded, "All this is extremely troubling."
(Shout out to the "Legally Blonde" fans now screaming "Mens Rea!!!!" as Hatch brings it up.)
Arguably Pres. Trump's closest friend in Congress, McCarthy is pushing back hard. https://t.co/UonJQWnRxH
MANCHIN is behind me, leaving the hearing room after listening.  What should I ask him? https://t.co/ry0JLLyvWl
PBS @NewsHour remains the only outlet truly going to gavel to gavel with anchored coverage.  Just FYI. You know.  https://t.co/JxR2Us5CXF https://t.co/IcajYfa9cq
KAVANAUGH on his 2003 email pointing out some scholars question Roe:   "That was referring to the views of legal scholars... that (previous statement) wasn't technically accurate.  It was overstating that and I'm always concerned about accuracy."
NOW: Feinstein asking Kavanaugh about his 2003 email raising idea that some doubt Roe v. Wade is settled law.  !  Watch: https://t.co/JxR2Us5CXF
4. "Save Roe! Save abortion!"  5. "Save democracy, save Roe!"
2. "My 12-year-old daughter and millions of Americans will die without access to health care. ... All of you shame! Shame! Shame!" 3. "Save democracy, save Roe."  Note: #3 was most physical protester we have seen yet, forcing police to scatter all the chairs in the row as went.
@avidindoorsman Right.
NEW - LEAKED KAVANAUGH DOC: add @NewsHour to those who have obtained the 2003 email from Kavanugh in which he pushes back against notion that scholars see Roe as settled law.  (@nyt broke it.) Here is key part, from source to me. https://t.co/wDe8VmtCiK
BRING IT ON. As Cornyn tells Democrats that Booker has clearly broken committee rules, Democrats say "Bring it on".  Wow.
Protester 1. "Save our Constitution, save our country."
AND OF COURSE meanwhile, Dems inside the hearing are in full rebellion, saying they reject the committee's "committee confidential" designation of Kavanaugh documents.  Republicans are incensed.  Not clear how this ends.
NOW: Congressional Black Caucus is outside the hearing room, saying African-Americans have the most to lose re: Kavanaugh Bc courts have most often been the remedy for discrimination https://t.co/zA8ArWzw1a
Outside Grassley's office: Capitol Police are so far calmly waiting, letting protesters chant, speak.
Inside Grassley's office: fired-up, sometimes emotional protesters are giving Occupy-style call-and-respond speeches.  So far, talking abortion rights, pre-existing conditions, guns.  Chanting "we will not go back." https://t.co/nbRWMwAtF7
GRASSLEYS OFFICE NOW: is filled with anti-Kavanaugh protesters.  This is one floor below the hearing room. https://t.co/2QCcBm0QrN
KAVANAUGH DAY 2, is a wrap.
I would love it if there were a group of protesters who held up signs reading, "Yield back your time!" whenever senators were clearly doing nothing useful  and just soaking up the clock.
Idea for Democrats: Everyone who is not Kamala Harris should pool their time and give it to her.  Idea for Republicans: Everyone who is not John Cornyn should pool their time and give it to him.
Harris: Can you think of any decisions that give the government the power to make a decision about a man's body?  Kavanaugh: Uh, (asks for clarification), no I'm not aware of any.
Harris: are you aware the term "racial spoils system" is used by white supremecists?  Kavanaugh: I wrote that 20 years ago and the answer is no.
Harris: Have you heard the term "racial spoils system"?  Kavanaugh: Yes.   Harris: You twice used that term in a WSJ piece.  "Spoils" is defined as goods stolen.  What does that phrase mean to you?  K: (after back/forth) I'm not sure what I was referring to then, to be frank.
Harris: Do you believe there was blame on both sides for Charlottesville?  Kavanaugh: judges need to stay out of current events and commenting on current events.
.@SenKamalaHarris to Kavanaugh: Have you had a conversation with anyone about Bob Mueller's investigation?  Kavanaugh: I've talked to fellow judges.  Harris: Other than fellow judges.  Kavanaugh: About his investigation? ... It's a topic in the news everyday... Uh. Yes.
If you stepped away from the Kavanaugh hearing, now is a good time to tune back in.    Watch here: https://t.co/L0VIySvWjq
NOW at Kavanaugh hearing: More protesters, but apologies that I'm no longer in the room and can't pass on their words.
NOW: Harris starts out sharp.   "Have you had any conversations about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at (names law firm)?"  Kavanaugh: I'm not remembering but if you want to (give me more details)
Worth the read, this story. https://t.co/a23BRDAmgL
54. *Not shouting* "Please vote no on Kavanaugh. Presidents shouldn't have (unlimited power)."
53. "That's why he was nominated. Executive immunity has no place in democracy. For all of you who support this it absolutely unAmerican and shame on you!"
52. "Judge Kavanaugh, who paid your $200,000. Who bought you? Who?"
@jbendery Or babysitter for us. Why have you kept this hidden???
51. "Denying disabled people..." then made out word "economic".
The Judiciary Committee cut public seating for Kavanaugh hearing. And now has restored it.  Read: https://t.co/3ji0V1DtTk
Protester 50. "You swore an oath before God to uphold the Constitution!"
47. Senators Collins and Murkowski, vote no! You know he is going to overturn it! You know he is! 48. My brother has Downs Syndrome - people of all abilities have rights! 49. Freedom of speech means nothing if we don't have freedom of informatn. Many ppl don't know that he lied.
Meanwhile.   Wow, the NYT Op-Ed from the "senior Trump administration official".   https://t.co/kwC6HRc09Z
Protester 45. "Kavanaugh hates women"  46. "Abortion saved my child’s life, ask me how, my child would not be here...he is 12 years old"*  *This is what our team heard, we do not speak to or know  meaning behind it.  (Thanks to @SaherMKhan for the assist.)
MY STORY: Public seating cut in half at Kavanaugh hearing.    https://t.co/3ji0V1DtTk
@ACUConservative I don't have that reporting and have not spoken to those people - so cannot say either way. But I do know from covering protests that protesters often are given cash ahead to handle police processing fees for their planned arrest.
Softball. (soft-bal') noun - Sen. Mike Lee asking Kavanaugh, "Do you have a favorite of the Federalist Papers?"
Protester 44. "Kavanaugh will not protect the Constitution! He will only protect his archaic world view. He will not protect the Constitution! The American people have no faith in you sir!"
Except remember that a lot of Congressional Republicans don't want the wall. https://t.co/vKZMZfiCdd
43. "If abortion is illegal, women will die!! ... We will not go back! We will not go back!"
42. "You're a political hack who will take away our health care and women's rights while pretending to be impartial!!"
Protester 41. "Why don't you listen to us? If you love America, stop this travesty of a ... (left room)"
38. This person was creative and simply clapped. 39. "This is a sham! We should have an impeachment hearing not a confirmation hearing!" 40. "We! Will not go back! We! Will not go back!"
37. "We. Will not go back!" "We. will. not go back!!"
36. Very hard to hear.  I heard "the president" and maybe "conflict" and "Kavanaugh".
35. "Can you look my granddaughters and daughters in the eye and tell them.... (didn't catch)" 36. "Stop Kavanaugh! Our bodies,our choice!" (In Handmaid's outfit)
33. "The majority of this country does not support the majority of this committee" 34. "I'm 18 and  I represent the youth of this country"
32. "Prosecuting a sitting president is not a hypothetical (hard to make out) ... you need to answer that question."
Kavanaugh protesters  I missed 29 while live on TV.  30. Just now. (Did not catch the words.) 31. And Citizen's United! Save our Democracy!
28. "Health care is at stake, Immigration rights are at stake. Everything is at stake. You have the power to stop this."
Can the president pardon himself?  KAVANAUGH: The question of self-pardons is something I have not analyzed.  I am not sure I can ring in on that here.
What I don't understand:  Why has no one asked Kavanaugh if he would recuse himself from any case directly involving President Trump and a criminal matter?
WHAT IS GOING ON NOW?: Leahy is criticizing Grassley, GOP for keeping 100,000 pages of Kav docs "confidential", so sens can't talk about them.  Grassley is countering that Leahy could have asked for specific pages to be excepted... and didn't.   Also, there was confusion by all
WHAT IS LEAHY DOING?: Trying multiple avenues to explore/prove his theory that Kavanaugh has mislead the committee in the past.
Dem organizing opposition group to Kavanaugh --&gt; https://t.co/QifsMNRv4H
@just_whatever I'm afraid I don't have an official reason from Cap Police or the committee. But the public has now been allowed back in.
NOW: Dem Sen. Leahy steps to the plate.    No member of the Senate has seen more SCOTUS nominees.
@Spartacussin Sorry not tracking that way. : (  It is a mix though. Hard to say what proportions.
With public allowed back in the room, protesters are back as well (the seem to make up most of the public here).   Now: 27: "Senators in name of our democracy, I ask you to halt these hearings." 28: "Vote no! Vote no!"
Note: The two African-American senators on the Judiciary Committee are not here as Judge Kavanaugh talks about the importance of diversity and his work to hire diverse law clerks.
@WitchyDruss Members of the public are allowed to attend w/out invitation. They simply must wait in line and clear security/mags.
NOW - Kavanaugh:   After 45 minutes with no public inside, police are allowing folks waiting in public line outside to take seats in the room again.  They just started walking in.  cc: @aterkel @jbendery
HATCH: (softball) Can you give examples of when you ruled against the Bush admin?  KAV: Hamdan.  Question was if prosecution was unlawful? I wrote the opinion reversing his conviction.   (Hamdan struck down Bush administration's initial military commissions at Guantanamo.)
KAVANAUGH.  Meanwhile, public still not allowed back in the hearing room. Those seats remain empty.
NOW, re: TRUMP.  Feinstein: Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?  Kavanaugh: That's a hypothetical question. I can't give you an answer on that.  (He cites Ginsburg's hearing in which she declined to talk hypothetical cases.)
KAVANAUGH: September 11th changed my thinking on the presidency and independent counsels.    I proposed ideas for Congress to consider, but those were not Constitutional views. I have not taken a position on the Constitutionality of executive power and ind. counsels.
NOW: Feinstein has sign w/ Kavanaugh quote: "If the president were sole subject of a crim. investigation, I would say no one should be investigating that."  Question: what did you mean? What are circumstances when a sitting president could be subject to criminal investigation?
Important - Kavanaugh: My view right now is Roe is an important precedent reaffirmed many times. Casey reaffirmed it and became a precedent on precedent.    Another example: Miranda - was reaffirmed in 2000.  (An interesting comparison. Roe to Miranda, the basis of Miranda rts.)
Kavanaugh: I understand your point of view senator (on women having reproductive rights) and also understand how passionately this is felt on both sides.
Kavanaugh: One thing to keep in mind in Roe v Wade is it has been reaffirmed many times over recent years, most prominently in Casey v Planned Parenthood.
The question.  Feinstein: What do you mean by settled law? (Yes this is about Roe.)
KAVANAUGH: The court has upheld abortion access based on that rationale.
FEINSTEIN - ABORTION QUESTION: do you agree w/ Justice O'Connor that a woman's right to control her own body also affects her ability to control (her overall circumstance, economic ability)?
TOPIC ONE: Guns.  Feinstein: I'm talking about your statement that assault weapons are in "common use". They are not.  Kavanaugh: Semi-automatic rifles are common in the United States. Many many are owned.  Feinstein: you are saying numbers mean use? These are not commonly used
NOW: Police and staff are keeping all seats for the public empty.  No more public inside. There is a line outside, unclear if this is temporary.   This is why you hear no more protests. https://t.co/ZMOzwvUYU7
NOW: Democrats begin questioning of Supreme Court nominee and potential deciding vote Brett Kavanaugh.  First topic: guns, assault weapons and school shootings. (Feinstein asking.)  Watch here: https://t.co/L0VIySvWjq
26: "The people dissent! The people dissent!"
KAVANAUGH: This moment is a moment of judicial independence. How I interact w/ this committee.  I ask "how has it been done before?"  When I'm sitting here, what did I do, I studied nominee precendent, Marshall, Brennan, those on the court now.
25. "The Constitution! The Constitution!"
KAVANAUGH: for 12 years I've been applying precedent of the Supreme Court and of my court.   Precedent is the foundation of our system.
24. (Listening to Kavanaugh now - missed what she said.)
Grassley: Have you ever followed precedent of Supreme Court when doing so conflicted w/ your personal beliefs.  Kavanaugh: My personal beliefs (do  not matter).  Precedent matters... b/c law much be predictable.
23. "Give us the documents. What are you hiding?"
22. "The people have a right to know..."
21. "No Trump puppet. No Trump puppet."
20. "Yes means death. Yes means death."
19.   I'm afraid I couldn't quite make out what she said. But it seemed to rhyme.
Protesters continued 17. "This is a democracy" 18. "Stop this"
13. "Mr. Kavanaugh, this is a position of integrity." 14. "You can boycott his, you can save us. 15. "There are ... more of us than there are of you and we deserve justice." 16. "Stop the cover up. Release the information"  Grassley: This is coming out of my time, but that's ok.
11. 12. (Protesters)
KAVANAUGH pointed to 3 cases he sees as historic, displaying independence of SCOTUS:  Youngstown Steel: Limited president's power to seize property  US v Nixon: Court ordered the president to hand over tapes, subpoenaed material.  Brown v Board of Ed: Ended school segregation.
"I'm a veteran and a health care voter."
10.
Protester 9.
Protester 8:  "You wouldn't shake the hand of the father..."
Protester 7, as Kavanaugh answers his first question.  Shouts about the independence of the Constitution right as Kavanaugh talks about independence of the judiciary.
Protester #6.  All I caught was "Merrick Garland".
NOTE - CHANGE at KAVANAUGH hearings today: half of the seats for the public have been reassigned to "Senate staff". So there are just 22 for the public now.    So far 4-5 protesters removed from them. https://t.co/YMUp8IagnW
FIRST PROTEST of the day: "our courts are broken" says one protester.  "Mother Earth" repeats another.  "Stop the slaughter of our children. Sham president" says a third.
KAVANAUGH: If confirmed to the Supreme Court, I will keep an open mind in every case.
This is the first time since Grassley started this hearing that all senators are in their seats and paying undivided attention to the person speaking. (Kavanaugh.)
BIGTIME cc everyone in America.  And everyone in Congress. https://t.co/GC569vQ6a7
Points to Kavanaugh for name-dropping the entire eighth-grade girls basketball team he coaches. Well played.
@elkmovie I should let you know that I am a pro-reporting reporter.
KAVANAUGH: I am a pro-law judge.
@kairyssdal She introduced him, or is my brain dead and I don't get the question here...? (They go way back... Bush folks.)
KAVANAUGH more: A judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and precedent. The rules of legal interpretation are rules of common sense.
KAVANAUGH: I have given it my all in each case (I heard). ... Don't read about my opinions, read my opinions.
DURBIN NOW to KAVANAUGH: "Over and above (all the other concerns he named), you are the nominee of Donald Dohn Trump - this is president who has shown he is contemptuous of rule of law. "
PROTESTERS: this woman told me she is 82 and from Manhattan.  Why is she here, I asked. "I think that would be obvious," she said. https://t.co/muJ677xMFF
@senorrinhatch That was brief. Chants getting more distant/quiet. Likely as police move the protesters (guess).
Honestly it has gotten a little hard to hear @senorrinhatch over the chants coming from outside the room.
CHANTING from outside the Kavanaugh hearing room can be heard inside right now.
More protesters, including the loudest on yet, "Kavanaugh cannot be trusted!!!"
OK, so at the moment this Kavanaugh hearing is back on the traditional track.    Dem objections and protests ended up consuming first 1 hour and 15 minutes.
NOW: Next round of protesters interrupting the hearing.
Voters always love: lots of talk about the Senate's rules.
UPDATE: We are one hour into the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and no one has made any opening statements yet.
CONFIDENTIAL DOCS:  - So far Grassley's office says only one Democrat has requested permission to talk about 4 documents.  - That's Klobuchar. Her request totals 12 pages, says Grassley's office.
ABOUT THOSE COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS:  - There are many many, about 100,000+ - Senators on Judiciary can see them but can't talk about them. - BUT they can request permission to talk about them.  more...
@TheBrodyFile Not contending the greater point but has Coons announced his vote?
NOW: Police are leaving most of the Kavanaugh seats for the public stay empty after protesters escorted out. https://t.co/nRjtHOrAKn
The fact that it is Grassley in this particular role is a stroke of Aaron Sorkin genius. He and Hatch have the least tolerance for this kind of interruption tactic.
CORNYN. NOW: if this were a court proceeding, every member on the other side would be held in contempt of court.  (Crowd lightly boos.)
Hearing ground rules, says Grassley: no standing or blocking views.    15 min break after Cruz, then one before introducers.  Then oath, then close w his testimony.
Note: we are not permitted to shoot video from the hearing room floor.  So still pics only for now.  May run to video spot  later.
THE PROTESTERS: are all in the back two rows - these are the seats for the public.  Roughly 40 spots.  Many being left empty at moment as protesters removed. https://t.co/L9BT4wK2Vy
CAPITOL POLICE and protesters are both acting in very good faith.  Police calmly removing, really escorting out those who yell.  And they are leaving quickly.   The crowd laughed as one yelled "I'm walking, I'm walking"
WHAT's happening:  One by one protesters, some clearly connected to each other, some not as much, are yelling and interrupting.  One said this: "an illegitimate president cannot make an appointment to Supreme Court" "this should be an impeachment proceeding "
Kavanaugh is looking directly as Dems as they speak.
NOW: @SenKamalaHarris and Dems are pushing to adjourn Bc they say there has not been time or access to documents.  Crowd has cheered and a women who is shouting "this is a travesty" is being removed. No, three women.
That sound you heard: is the whir of roughly 10,000 photos that were just taken of Brett Kavanaugh, just now. https://t.co/trgSgwIPpX
MORE. Protesters are here from the other point of view on abortion/reproductive rights as well.  These folks want more restrictions/ to overturn Roe. https://t.co/4X8jleXwEF
NOW: Waiting outside Kavanaugh hearing room. A silent but rather clear protest. (Re: abortion.) https://t.co/VHku1dDEkS
Beautiful photos from McCain burial are here: https://t.co/6BP4gdMlcG
@philcefaratti Nice. No, I'm about to record something in Shirlington. : (
Wow. Chaka Khan.
To answer questions, I'm not sure exactly what he meant there.  Why it got my attn. But having covered the @SpeakerRyan for many years, I think it was what it appears to be - a very general statement about being proud of and aiming to make the nation better
VP Pence, now: "The president asked me to be here ... to pay a debt of gratitude and respect" to Sen. McCain.
Speaker Ryan: We have a chance to do what (John McCain) did, to stand up for our beliefs.
McCain: "This is one of the bravest souls" ever produced by the United States, Speaker Ryan told the Capitol just now.
There is something especially stirring about seeing members of each of our military services lined up honoring and carrying the last remains of one of our veterans.
@Dawgzze Thank you for this tweet.  It is not my accusation. Instead I was pointing out that others are making the accusation.  And I pointed out that DeSantis denies it.
New: Dem, @Sen_JoeManchin hopes for a GOP spoiler are dashed. https://t.co/ql9ESLKISq
Seems good time to mention that @LindseyGrahamSC said he and McCain saw Alaska @SenDanSullivan as a natural person to pick up McCain's mantle on military issues. https://t.co/3zOr8br6FA
ICYMI... Maricopa County, AZ had problems with voting machines in 62 precincts (not getting them running on time).  But is not changing vote schedule. https://t.co/aggw0n21jc
@JaredRizzi *tips hat*
45 MINUTES until polls close in AZ!  WHICH MEANS you can watch Pitch Perfect 2 on FX right now and (probably) make it to the final song in Denmark before the Senate race is called.
NEW. Sen @LindseyGrahamSC on what MCCain advised him about @realDonaldTrump: "Help him where you can, but don't get sucked into all his bullshit."
@ChadPergram Chad, do you recall or know if Pres. Bush ordered flags lowered for Sen. Craig Thomas in 2007? I see the Bush statement of condolence but not an exec. order about flags.
McConnell on McCain: "I will miss one of the very finest gentlemen with which I have had the honor to serve. ...   I consider it our privilege to return some of the love John poured out for this country. ...   Well done, good and faithful servant. Well done."
McConnell now: "The first miracle in John (McCain)'s career is that he somehow made it through school."   McCain would have loved that.
Fellow Republican --&gt; https://t.co/A7oBSdutEP
Senate floor. https://t.co/Aj85t4MW4h
NOW: @SenateMajLdr McConnell  now speaking about Sen. McCain.
From Pres. @realDonaldTrump Now: "Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain’s service to our country and, in his honor, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment. "

@HenryIsOurDog Cc: @mtill50 https://t.co/ik4qm9vSMr
As I told @frontlinepbs: McCain was all about two things - duty and defiance.  For him those did not conflict. For others, they might have. Not him. It was mostly the same thing.
Sen. McCain, it was an honor to cover you.
Add the validity/reality of the Space Force to your GOP divide list. https://t.co/rNHuisSDsa
@cindymccain One of the great assignments of my career has been covering McCain, including his 2000 run (was there for the insanity of SC).    He's still with us now of course, but feeling quite sad.
!BREAKING: McCain family announces that Senator McCain has decided to discontinue medical treatment, after more than a year of fighting aggressive form of cancer.
NOW: Senate holding vote on whether to defund Planned Parenthood.  The lack of 60 Senate votes for that idea is the only thing keeping it from happening.  (Though separately there probably would be court action later if it did happen.)
TRUMP FOX INTVW summary: - I was not in charge of the campaign - Cohen was a nice guy - He pleaded guilty to things that weren't a crime (?Expect debate on that today) - I personally paid the Stormy Daniels $ - Sessions never took control of the Justice Dept - I respect Manafort
SO: FOX clarifies that the president never said he was thinking of pardoning Manafort. Instead anchor Ainsley Earhardt said "it sounded to me like he was considering it".
Trump on whether he'll fire Sessions or Rosenstein: I wanted to stay uninvolved but when everyone sees what's going on ... even my enemies say Jeff Sessions should have told you he was going to recuse himself (so you wouldn't have picked him).
President Trump about the campaign:  I wasn't in charge, people like to say that, but I wasn't in charge.
Trump to FOX: I put in an attorney general that never took control of the Justice Dept.
Trump: "One of the reasons I respect Paul Manafort so much is he went through that trial... " doesn't finish that thought but talks about other people "flipping" in court cases.
Trump on Michael Cohen: I always found him to be a nice guy.   .. He pleaded to two counts - those weren't even a crime.  It wasn't campaign finance. ... They didn't come out of the campaign.
NOW: FOX airing portion of @realDonaldTrump interview where he talks about Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort and Jeff Sessions.
It is an amazing read... https://t.co/zA2pyBaQSY
NOW: Senate Dems on Judiciary meeting in Schumer's office to talk Kavanaugh.
G'night. Just finished my "What the $@%! just happened?" story for our website tomorrow.
Early returns in WY:  - Barrasso is crushing upstart Dave Dodson for Senate, ahead 43 points with 12% of precincts in. - Trump's candidate Foster Friess is behind state treasurer Mark Gordon in the governors race (Gordon ahead 30% to 23% currently.)
NOTICED SOMETHING ODD in the Cohen documents.  Never does Cohen say that he acted under the "direction of" or "in coordination" of a candidate for federal office (presumed to be Trump).  That charge was only made verbally in court today, by Cohen. It's not in the docs.
BREAKING: @SpeakerRyan just announced he is removing Rep. Duncan Hunter from his committee assignments while he is under indictment.   He serves on Armed Services, Education and Transportation/Infrastructure.
@JesseFFerguson I see what you did there
READ exactly what Cohen said he (and the federal candidate he worked for) did - here is the prosecuting doc:    https://t.co/EUKrDDqIQq
LAST TWO HOURS: - Trump's ex-lawyer guilty of 8 charges, implicates Trump in cpgn finance crime. - Trump's ex-campaign chair found guilty on 8 non-campaign-related charges.  - GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter indicted on campaign finance charges. - Dems still not able to block Kavanaugh
NEW BREAKING: DOJ has just indicted Congressman Duncan Hunter, R-CA, charging he and his wife misused thousands of dollars in campaign funds and lied about it in filings.
COHEN DOC starts with this amazing stipulation: "In or about January 2017, Cohen ... began holding himself out as the "personal attorney" to Individual-1, who at that point had become the President of the United States."
NOW, reading 22-pg Cohen charging or information doc.   Watch this thread...
TRUMP IN WV: "I feel very bad for Paul Manafort" and his verdict has nothing to do with Russia or Russia collusion.
15 minutes... https://t.co/DX28XH9Jz4
PROSECUTORS IN NY about the Cohen case:  The message is - the rule of law applies. We are here, we are a nation of laws.
COHEN, prosecutors say:  - He submitted false invoices to Trump Org. for "personal services" when it was really for the hush money he paid to women.  - He performed no legal services (for Trump) in 2017, though was paid as if he did.
COHEN DETAILS.  NEW.  Prosecutors say he failed to report over $4 million in income on taxes.  (Over five years.)   And that he pleaded guilty to lying about bank loan applications, hiding $14 million in debt.   Also, pleaded guilty to two cmpgn finance violations re: 2016 elex.
Manafort legal team: Mr. Manafort is disappointed in not getting acquittals all the way through. ... He is considering his options now.
And this is when Chuck Schumer is slated to come to the mics, folks.   (5:15 media avail was scheduled this am.)
SUMMARY: - Cohen pleading guilty - !!!Cohen says he was directed to break campaign finance laws by the candidate involved.  - The candidate details match Donald Trump.  - Meanwhile, Trump's one-time campaign mgr just found guilty of breaking tax and banking laws.
America divided. #ManafortJury

Where to watch the Senate hearing on care of immigrant children, w/ DHS, HHS, DOJ here - live here: https://t.co/jgabQHf7OI
@clairecmc HHS and DOJ have decried the Senate report, in statement:  "The report demonstrates fundamental misunderstandings of law and policy related to the safety and care (of these children)."  And Senate committee "chose to ignore many operational realities and basic legal authorities."
NOW: @clairecmc ripping HHS as staff claimed it's too hard to find contacts in each state to tell about imm. kids placed there.  McCaskill: No! It is not hard to get. EVERY state has a child welfare agency.  She also says what feds doing wld be huge scandal if it were a state.
Rather astounding summary so far:   No one is in charge of making sure the 1000s of unaccompanied kids placed with sponsors are actually with sponsors, getting care, not being trafficked.    HHS insists it's not their job - even though they sign the agreements w/ the sponsors.
@BarclayPalmer Yes - see latest tweet
@cmcasarez Thank you for that flag. I was honestly so sad I forgot to send the link.

@BDipert Me too. Makes it even more painful.
And PS, the abusive priest was the secretary of the church's internal court, the tribunal.
PA Catholic Abuse report - here: https://t.co/b0gLTxCg1V  cc: @DavidPontious
In other words, a high-ranking priest was writing the bishop concerned that they needed to recognized a known-abuser priest's 25th anniversary in a magazine but that an "irrational" father of an abused child would "bang on the door" if they published it.     Just no words.
"If ((Fr. Lawrence's - the abuser's) photo and biography appear," writes the Msgr., "(the abused boy's) father will be banging on the door once again. If no mention of (the abuser) is made... it creates another problem."
Unbelievable. In PA report:  A Msgr. writing the bishop about accused abuser Fr. Lawrence, details parent's anger and the abuse and then writes "Now comes the problem."   Says issue is whether to put abusive priest's photo in magazine as they honor his 25th anniversary.  More...
PA CATHOLIC ABUSE REPORT, pg. 59: Letter from Msgr. to bishop, alerting him to a ' "sticky" situation'  in which he writes the father of an abused boy was "as angry as I have ever seen anyone" and "he was almost irrational".   Abuser became high-ranking official. After the abuse

Not trying to be gadfly but why is CNN describing the sidebars and meetings delaying the Manafort trial as "secretive"?    Aren't they merely "confidential"? They are not meetings the jurors are supposed to hear, clearly. And we know about them.
@OuttaBoro @MagicalHamShake Incorrect. Mainly using math to show the large amount of documents involved.
Pro-Kavanaugh Judicial Crisis Network on the doc debate: "Democrats have already announced that they oppose him so this claim that they need more time or more documents is nothing more than a show, a fishing expedition designed to obstruct and create gridlock."
That's a page every two seconds.   So technically possible. Actually impossible. https://t.co/lizXPXpnPO
Actually I just tried it.   It's not possible. https://t.co/lizXPXpnPO
KAVANAUGH. Sept. 4 hearing means:  You would have to read more than 28 pages per minute, every minute starting now in order to read the all the documents expected in his file.  Which is possible.   Except for the sleep and bodily functions issues.
KAVANAUGH HEARING: To begin Sept. 4!  (Want to mention as an aside that I believe I was first to report that likely timing... last week, baby.)  https://t.co/zTndosF1v1

INTO THE STRETCH:  It's O'Connor, O'Connor ahead, no it's Balderson, no it's O'Connor again.
NOW:  - GOP's Balderson is up by 1.3 percentage points in OH-12...  - Gap is less than 2000 votes ahead of Dem O'Connor. - @DelawareCoOhio is having a HUGE Twitter night.
@jmfriedland I am hostage, but to the whims and communications ups and downs of sick, feisty and very adorable toddler.
@FeldyJan Fortunately my mother did as well and texted me asking about it...
@cblittlefield That like was from me. Sick child now napping. Which I also like.
At this point in journalism do we need to disclose when you liked a tweet by the president due to your toddler getting a hold of the phone?   Max is ALL OVER the Iran sanctions story, apparently.
@British_Airways hello, Cld you help us with a lost bag? We have called daily or every other day for two weeks now and I'm afraid your customer service representatives have given either conflicting or no information to us.    Could you send us the number of someone who cld help?
THE NEWS HERE: Judge has ordered Trump admin. must restore DACA w/in 20 days.  (Yes, Trump admin. can appeal.)
DACA ruling more. Judge wrote:  - The Court is NOT ruling on if Trump can end DACA, only that he must have rational  reason.  - The Trump admin. was "arbitrary and capricious" in ending DACA.  - The Court gave DHS the chance to fix this once before and "will not do so again".
NEW: Federal judge writes that DHS/WH has created its own DACA dilemma.  - They can't stand by initial arguments for ending DACA b/c courts rejected them  AND - They can't now rely on new arguments it's making for the first time now.
READ: D.C. District Court opinion that Trump @realDonaldTrump has failed to justify the ending of DACA program.  https://t.co/KonJ6cElxz  (h/t @courtneyknorris )
ACLU: We believe 95% of the deported, separated parents are in Honduras and Guatemala.
Government says it hopes that manual file review will lower that number and clear up some of that information.
Wow. Judge just said there are STILL 120 parents who are essentially unknown - no good information about who they are.    (Unclear how many kids - he may have meant 120 kids.)
Girl missing from National Airport has been found safe &gt;&gt;&gt; https://t.co/tdl2vnq0W5
Judge: "The reality is that for every parent not (never) located there will be a permanently orphaned child that this 100% the responsibility of the administration."
NOW: Judge asks that government appoint a single person to head up reunification of remaining separated kids.  Says just 13 or so of those reunified and calls that "unacceptable".
@meaghano Thanks and shout out to my fellow adoptive moms here...
@EllenDibble (Unless the reporter agrees that it is off the record. And reporters should be very wary of doing that.)
@mtill50 #fishmonger
@mtill50 reference in the am mtg!!   Everyone dri.. er, glare at someone who's talking too long.
My fave:   A past press aide for John Conyers emailed me with: "Off the record, no comment."  ???  (And anticipating qstns - I am naming the office bc I did not agree to any source protection.  In general, an email stating something is "off record" does not make it off record.) https://t.co/z2LIrUtNQT
From the same aide on Dems not asking for Kavanaugh delay now:   Our focus in not on procedure but on securing the full set of documents + discussing the key issues, + that’s where it will remain.  Sens Grassley and McConnell clearly already have the timeline mapped out...
Have had multiple issues on this front with various offices.
VENT at you Washington.  On the record = We say you, by name, said what you said. **It is the default position of all conversations with a journalist.**  If you ask + we agree, it could be:  On background = We report, don't use your name.  or   Off record = we don't report.
@jbendery @frankthorp I've been wondering if Democrats can hold onto HI-1, myself.
Actually:  Key Democratic aide involved in SCOTUS nomination debate tells me Schumer is NOT going to ask for a delay in the hearing.  Key GOP and Democratic senators' office to me: We expect the confirmation hearings the week after Labor Day. https://t.co/ewnTQiBeYS
Wow, great score for @latimes!!! https://t.co/i2sTeYT718
Now: President Trump listening as inner city pastors, mostly African-American, thank him and most praise him - for boldness, being a man of his word, listening.  He clearly loves these kinds of events, including this one.

BREAKING:     SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- US appeals court: Trump's executive order threatening to withhold funding from `sanctuary cities' is unconstitutional.
Meanwhile, want to note @PressSec is making good on promise to try to get in qstns from a good number of reporters today.
.@Yamiche just now pressed the WH on how the Trump admin's policies in inner cities (esp. allowing rent increases, removing segregation limits) are affecting inner cities.  This as president about to meet with inner city pastors.  (@PressSec asked 4 more details.)
Sarah Sanders, now: "The president is not obstructing, he's fighting back."
Now: WH briefing!  Streaming here: https://t.co/ozgfk4Gboa
Now. Waiting for first WH briefing since a whole bunch of  tweets and news from @realDonaldTrump   Our @Yamiche is there, ready. I'll live tweet, pretending I'm there.
@realmrdean Thank you for the tweet, sincerely.   Please check my reporting - I wrote and spoke extensively on the Clinton probe and Comey's conclusion that she and her team were careless w/ classified info and potentially violated law.   And please share more on "showing your colors".
NEW, OVERLOOKED: Treasury is getting creative to fund looming giant deficits, keep gov. operating.  https://t.co/scvCC3kn5r
2.End game here? Clearly the president a) isn't firing Sessions or ending this probe (he could)  b) but wants his base to blame Sessions for Mueller.
Among the ?s here:  1. How has Mueller "stained our country" at this point? (Trump has argued Manafort, Cohen, Flynn treated unfairly, but staining the country is new sweeping charge.) https://t.co/fOCs27Ug51
This https://t.co/CHb6zJnh0E
MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE SHUTDOWN STORY, at this point, is the fact that it is not yet a story.    It is a threat, from an unpredictable WH which likes to be unpredictable.   Wait a few weeks and we'll know if this is definite possibility or passing distraction.

From Homeland Security Chairman Johnson:  2. He told VP Pence at Senate lunch today that the admin. needs to be more transparent and put out what it knows - #s, issues - when it knows it. 3. He spoke to HHS Sec. Azar this am, hopes to speak to DHS Sec. Nielsen today.
NEW - Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson told me:  1. Only recently have HHS and DHS given immigrants "family reunification" numbers - ways to correspond cases of parents and family. (He didn't recall exact date.)
NOW - all three branches: GOP Leader McConnell and VP Pence flank SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh at his first Cap Hill meeting.   Kavanaugh keeps a steady smile, blinks, stays silent.    These guys all know how to do this.
NEED TO CORRECT:  There is a current Dem who voted yes for Kavanaugh to sit on Appeals Court in 2007.    Sen. @TomCarperforDE
https://t.co/CJZTmbR2dU may have crashed.   (Not coming up on my tries...)
THUNE's office says he did not vote either way last time on Kavanaugh due to a family commitment in SD.  And entered in the Congressional Record that he would have been a yes.
DEM REAX - SPECTRUM of TONE:  Schumer: "President Trump has put reproductive rights and freedoms and health care protections for millions of Americans on the judicial chopping block"  vs  Warner: "There is much at stake with President Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh ...'
NOT VOTING EITHER YAY OR NAY on Kavanaugh's nomination for appeals court in 2006: 7 senators.   All but one are one.   That one is Sen. John Thune, R-SD.

Phew! I think someone else told her.  (Producer in her ear?) And I'm steering clear of her insistence about "confirmation hearings in the fall", bc that would be me being annoyingly know-it-all.  (It is looking late August/mid Sept at moment - tho we don't know really.)
@jamiedupree I might have to.  Ugh. Will see if she says it again.
Could use social skills advice!  When you overhear another broadcaster - one youve never met before - telling a live camera that the next Supreme Court nominee needs 60 Senate votes... how do you let them know? (W/out sounding like a jerk. Who was eavesdropping.)
@AndreasLupus That is a great tweet.
@DharmaLion33 No proxy voting in full senate.  Occasionally allowed in committee only.

To answer the question here -  sorry wasn't clear - "I don't think" or "I think" is how Hatch commonly confirms things that aren't public yet.  His sort of polite, longtime Senator way of getting ahead of things (which can drive colleagues crazy) but answering honestly (we love)
@nyyb4life @EWErickson @OrrinHatch That was his way of saying it's not her.
BREAKING: @OrrinHatch told a few of us that he knows who the SCOTUS pick is and "doesn't think" (polite Hatch language) it's Amy Coney Barrett."
Apologies. Kennedy was "en fuego" of course.    (As is my rapid-fire Twitter typo game.)

Government says: 19 parents with kids under five years old in US custody have been deported.
The government says those parents identified are in ICE custody... they are having trouble reaching parents released. (And deported.)
This as part of questions in court over the 101 kids under five in US custody who were separated... and deadline to make sure they have spoken to their parent.
NOW - 55 KIDS UNDER FIVE W/ NO IDENTIFIED PARENT.  US government tells judge it has ID'd the parents for just 46 of separated kids under five years old.
Wow Brazil

This does not tell us how many children under 5 were separated by the Trump Admin. policy.    Only how many remain separated.
NEW -  THE SMALLEST KIDS.  At last an answer.  HHS says about 100 children under the age of 5, in its custody right now, were separated from parents.
NEW: HHS new numbers on separated kids.  - !! Now: not more than 3000 kids who were separated from family are in HHS custody   - 3000 is larger number than we’ve seen. By about 600 kids. But it may be smaller in fact. HHS says it is giving a max figure.  More...
BREAKING: HHS says it will meet court order to reunite children w/ in 30 days (14 days if under 5 years old).  HHS says that may mean sending them to detention with parents, though they are hoping to avoid that.
NOW: on call w/ HHS Sec. Azar.  What he says is embargoed until it ends.   But obviously all of us hoping we get real #s, information on separated families.
@BardusMaxwell That means the world to us. And I love sappy. Thanks Maxwell.
THIS THREAD. Many voices we had wanted to hear and been trying to find on family separation, now a document release is putting out their stories. https://t.co/S4gBK4cnYO

@bix_beiderbeck @madebykathryn @amyewalter @NewsHour @txjacksbarbecue @sarajust The BBQ was the key.
@anndaly @madebykathryn @amyewalter @NewsHour @txjacksbarbecue @sarajust Well this email gets us closer to actually knowing each other.   Thank you for the kind words.  It was a good night to try to unwind.  Been a long month.
@JeanneChouard @madebykathryn @amyewalter @NewsHour @txjacksbarbecue @sarajust I am flagging this tweet for my husband, who, like me, loves Oregon and wine. And we can learn to love microbrews.
@MomOnTheVergeOf @madebykathryn @amyewalter @NewsHour @txjacksbarbecue @sarajust True, I am sprite-ly.  But Morgan and William also happen to be quite tall, too, you should know.

ICYMI - it took almost two weeks, but we now know that family separations under "zero tolerance" have ended.  Our reporting: https://t.co/QCaSZGHSPX
@MTJanene @TamponsForTrump @WPJohnWagner @Fahrenthold @hsu_spencer @GOP Well done @mtjanene... here's the story.  https://t.co/s05C6WTKQM
Story is up:  Government finally confirms child separations due to Trump policy have ended.  https://t.co/s05C6WTKQM   (sorry for late tweet - had a family baseball game)
@jacobsoboroff This is important b/c Trump admin said there would be an "implementation phase" for agencies to shutter this policy.  It was not clear when/if it had ended until now.
BREAKING - NEW: Child separations by DHS have ended.  HHS says for the first time, in email to me now, "we are not receiving anymore referrals as a result of the zero tolerance policy."  (Was 7th time asking... and after they told @jacobsoboroff last wk they were still happening)
Me to HHS: What is the timeline (for getting #s about these kids)?  HHS: Our time is working as expeditiously as possible.  Me: What did you mean that the court order's "parameters" have led to problems giving out numbers on these kids?  HHS: no response
Seriously let me know what you think of HHS's response to my questions about separated kids.   (I posted their full response here..) https://t.co/BZJmSCow4G
@SPWenc1 If Rep. Waters were president, absolutely I would push for a similar look at her statements.   In a parallel way, I analyzed President Obama's actions and statements in a way that - during the time - I did not do for then citizen Trump. Or leading Republicans.
NEW: HHS did respond to our questions, but their response is unclear.  They don't say this, but it does seem to imply they are not going to tell us - anymore - how many separated kids are in their custody.
No answer from HHS yet.  Unclear if this is a new blanket policy or if HHS simply did not give the numbers in this particular answer (which has been common). https://t.co/hkAjVHf4BB
FYI. Checking on this... https://t.co/lEbyPx2Dmc
This. Wow.  (big h/t @RAGreeneCNN) https://t.co/2bhvo157Jh
First target on Dems SCOTUS list, here... https://t.co/zabGcsjXZQ
@Jim_Jordan I suspect I know - but which thing that was said? (And by whom?)
GOOD POINT HERE. https://t.co/M5JGTzBQdW
@SPWenc1 It was a blanket statement and we conveyed that.  As you see throughout the rest of the story we indicate when he was nuanced, when he explained his statements more. But in this case it was a blanket statement about one nationality that I think could be interpreted varying ways.
@SPWenc1 In this case, the president said, of Mexico, "They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."
@SPWenc1 Second, I understand what you are saying but I want to stress our approach here. We wanted to post and focus on the president's words themselves, not what people assume he meant either way. Those judgement calls are for ppl to make and we do include context.
@SPWenc1 First I greatly appreciate you writing me on this.  I need this feedback and strive to be impartial and fact-based.
NEW: three new charges against Harvey Weinstein, NY prosecutors have announced.  (h/t @courtneyknorris )  https://t.co/ceKdlpHjNY
Huh. Note what's #2 on Dems attack list against GOP this key election year.  CC: @GOP  CC: @BudgetHawks https://t.co/pd8Hilq8tI
Three observations: 1. GOP does have a growing tariff issue in farm country  2. But their opponents have not yet figured out how to talk about it 3. And more and more GOPers think the answer is to channel Trump - almost tweet for tweet.  (See "sad!", general tone below. ) https://t.co/mYDVVYEAml
CSPAN getting a bit saucy here. https://t.co/3oA0kLFDEu
@susana_molloy Well, it can't be mailed as a postcard (no address space, etc.).   Would still need envelope, for variety of reasons.
IN SUMMARY.  The US Postal Service would not recognize the new "post-card-sized" tax form as a post card, FYI.  Extra postage required under current rules.  (Big h/t @UnwittingOtter)  https://t.co/0rvaaxMq3y
@DrewMCiccotelli I actually laughed out loud at your tweet there.
NEW, fwiw: IRS tells me new post-card sized tax form is 5.5" x 8.5".  A very large post card.  And two-sided. So the form space takes up essentially 8.5" x 11" total.   Overall, one page slimmer than current two-page form. https://t.co/Q5xl7Bi7yL
@jamiedupree But unclear: what the dimensions are, or font size.  (What I called to ask when  I got the "this is a nonworking number..." message for the media line listed.  Rerouted myself. Waiting for answers.)
@She_b_Christine No. Those were his quotes.
For your "basic communications problems" file:  The media phone # on a Treasury press release sent out this hour goes to this:   "You have reached a nonworking Department of Treasury number... no new number listing is available."
@polyandgut @Fahrenthold @cbo I definitely understand your point. But I think that is for readers, viewers to decide on this one. (And seems it's an easy call for those replying so far.)  I'm a bit old-fashioned this way. Want to lay out facts, not dictate or determine appropriate reaction.
PRESIDENT TRUMP on Capital Gazette shooting: "Horrible horrible" and "Journalists, like all Americans should be free from the fear of being violently attacked while doing their job.”
@martiw5kids1 @cbo Well, he could point to the dip from last year to this year (a decrease of less that $30b) as proof the deficit "is coming down", and "rapidly" is subjective.    I like to stick to facts, not guess motivation/mindset.    To me this is simply inaccurate. But glaringly so.
@johnccollins @MarketplaceWKND @lizzieohreally what? WHAT?
Trump admin is wildly inaccurate here. Facts:  - 2017 deficit: $559 b. Which, true was, slightly less than 2016, BUT - 2018 projected deficit: $739 b - 2019: $973 billion - 2020: $1.003 trillion - 2021: $1.1 trillion - 2022: $1.27 trillion  And it keeps increasing.

@lukeoneil47 thank you thank you for tweeting this.   We journos are losing this fight (unilateral dictated OTR/background) in an epic way in DC. Have been for years.
@DanielBush Seems, higher bonds for immigrants could be a de facto back door to indefinite detention...  "For most detained immigrants, securing a bond is their only chance to live outside of detention in the United States while the federal government determines whether to deport them..."
@JohnLGC Hey friend.  I think this is something that is either on your radar or the world def needs to be.  https://t.co/PG4EhlAWTd
IMPORTANT, OVERLOOKED on the family separation story:  Judges are setting bonds at unusually high amounts, including for asylum - and some cite Trump policy.  This is keeping families separated longer. *Great* reporting by @DanielBush   https://t.co/amHhxUIX68
NEW IMMIGRATION RULING. Just got a copy. Judge Shah ruled gov must release one separated child now. He wrote:  "The child's placement [in HHS shelter] likely violates the law..."  "[HHS] has no statutory basis to keep [the child] in custody if he is not an unaccompanied minor."
@allycollsteele @the_wing @RepCheri @RepSpeier @annaleekain @jenna_dc @SweetBaline @lets_go_postal THANK YOU ALLY for including us.  PS I need more pointers from Meghan Markle on the messy bun. Don't regret it. But will work on it.
*Love this photo, facial expression* https://t.co/25nuqRWYs9
THIS - CHILD SEPARATION MORE: Judge Shah asked gov lawyer if there is a process for these separated children to no longer have "unaccompanied" status.  Lawyer said no.  AP reports: "After a pause, Shah said the lack of a process could raise major constitutional issues."
Also this.  APNewsAlert - CHICAGO (AP) -- Judge orders immediate release of detained 9-year-old Brazilian boy who was separated from mom at the US-Mexico border.
To add to the convo, I also don't know what "local incident" means exactly.   Especially in this situation.
THIS.  Tweeting now, continuing to report is @PhilDavis_CG  who witnessed the shooting... https://t.co/ig8om9hIiG
LAW ENFORCEMENT to Reuters: Shooting at Annapolis newspaper being treated as local incident, not terrorism.
@mixedcircuits Ha - this is where we find them the most! It's not for avoiding us but more for fast travel b/t offices. (And I suspect, avoiding rain, snow, heat, etc.)
NOW: Senate has begun a vote series.  We do not yet know what they willl be voting on.   (Not officially - sounds like it will be Cruz Farm Bill amendment on SNAP, including other things, possibly final Farm Bill passage.)
HAVE NOT SEEN THIS BEFORE:  Ag Chairman @SenPatRoberts (GOP) just walked into the closed-door Dem.  senators lunch - saying he had to work out an issue.   This as he, others hope they are in final hours on that bill.
Spotted in Capitol basement (senate aide): WH aide! Marc Short.
UTAH's HATCH on prospects of Utah's Mike Lee getting the SCOTUS nomination:    I think his brother (Utah Supreme Court's Thomas Lee) has a better chance.  Because he is a judge.
Reporter now to Hatch: what will you do after you retire?  Hatch: I think I'm going to get in a lot of trouble. *laughs*
@JK_LiveLife That's what Democrats allege, fear.
READ HERE the resolution about the DOJ that the House just passed:   https://t.co/SLa7WvQmZj
NOW: 226-183 House passes resolution, "insists" DOJ hand over remainder of 1 million+ documents GOP has requested by July 6.  Looked party line.  Context: insisting does not force DOJ to act. But it is a VERY rare, open rebuke of a GOP-admin. agency by a GOP House.
Slash any situation. https://t.co/O4N6z5OQTz
Jordan has been waiting months for the chance to publicly question Rosenstein.   Not sure anyone is more read-in on details of the IG report, or fired up, on the conservative side.
NOW: fireworks in House Judiciary.  Jordan to Rosenstein: "Why are you keeping information from Congress?"  Rosenstein: "I'm not keeping anything from Congress"   (And that was the tamest part.)
@Holdthebaloney He was vibing faster than I could type. It is possible.
GOWDY to Rosenstein: "If you have evidence of wrongdoing by the Trump Cmpgn, present it to the grand jury. If you have evidence of wrongdoing by the president, present it to the American people. ... Whatever you are doing, finish it the hell up b/c this country’s being torn up."
NOW: Trey Gowdy has some strong words about the FBI, DOJ and bias against Trump. (In hearing w/ Rosenstein, Wray.)  As well as Democrats' push for impeachment before Mueller has presented any findings.
@GibbKathy I like your attitude.
*Reminder*: Congress still has not agreed on a way to change its own sexual harassment policy.  Victims still face mandatory 90 days of "counseling" and waiting.  (Also thanks to @campaign_purple for including me last night and to @annaleekain for the shout out.) https://t.co/jBRA3C6jS4

@brcodeman I would just like one good night of sleep tbh.
PENCIL IN FOR THIS FALL:  - Possible gov. shutdown. - SCOTUS nomination fight - Mueller news (big and/or small) - Health care premium spikes for some. - DACA, family immigration court cases in limbo (see SCOTUS fight above) - And let's say two October surprises.
AND... @SenSchumer about to speak on Senate floor re: Kennedy vacancy.  CSPAN2
@realDonaldTrump: We have a list of 25 people, as you know, from the election. (For SCOTUS)
POTUS @realDonaldTrump : "We will begin our search for a new justice of the Supreme Court, that will begin immediately."
McConnell: It is imperative the president's nominee be considered fairly and not be subjected to personal attacks.   ... We look forward to yet another outstanding selection.
McConnell: We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy's successor this fall.
McConnell, now. CSPAN2.
@OKnox @AJentleson Also interested in that question.
HEADS UP: McConnell about to go to Senate floor to talk about Kennedy retirement/vacancy.  CSPAN2.
" (Kennedy) said, too, that admiration for his colleagues on the Court means that he will retain warm ties with each of them in the years to come. ... "  ###
... "Kennedy added that while his family was willing for him to continue to serve, his decision to step aside was based on his deep desire to spend more time with them. ..."
... (Kennedy) said: “It has been the greatest honor and privilege to serve our nation in the federal judiciary for 43 years, 30 of those years on the Supreme Court. ...
FULL KENNEDY PRESS RELEASE (several tweets):   "Justice Kennedy today advised his colleagues that he is submitting to the President a formal notification of his decision, effective July 31 of this year, to cease active status as an Associate Justice and to assume senior status...
Everyone. Rewrite your nightly newscast now.
Ahem. This was the House GOP compromise immigration plan.  Might have been good of me to mention that part.
@lcsboyz The House GOP immigration compromise.  Good omission to point out.
BOOM.   Very large fail.   Massive abandon ship. Very little compromise. https://t.co/iwp2wJWvEy
Rrefresher.  GOP immigration bill would:  - Give many Dreamers a status, renewable every 6 yrs. Path to citizenship based on merit. - Limit legal immigration - Fund the border wall - End visa lottery - Limit asylum - Allow imm. families to stay together in indefinite detention
NOW: House voting on the GOP compromise immigration plan.  Watch CSPAN.
@MafitronGaming Yes. CSpan.
Excellent question.  This is the "Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2018".  It would be faster to call it BOSIRA,  but no one does. https://t.co/boRFmk2TVp
@Mark_Kawada would be an even bigger surprise than Crowley's loss.
HERE WE GO: House beginning votes on the GOP compromise immigration plan.  Now: motion to recommit In 15 min: Vote on the bill  Watch for: How this does compared w/ the 193 votes the more conservative Goodlatte bill got last week.
@jacobsoboroff @HHSGov Thanks. Really appreciate that.  I remain mad, fired up. If they hadn't cut off my mic I'd still be asking.
Good point here... https://t.co/ZYzlRvsiAk
@AliceOllstein Thanks for this. I briefly thought I dreamed that interaction.
HHS WOULD NOT ANSWER:  - ! If they are STILL receiving kids who are being separated from their parents.! (I asked 3 times.)  - What ages the kids are and why they have not answered that question tho many of us have asked it for over a week.
NEW FROM HHS:   Currently 2047 children separated from their parents remain in the agency's care.
STAND BY.   ON A CALL WITH HHS that is embargoed until it is over.  But let me say now my frustration level is high after they did not answer two key questions of mine.  A shame as this call seems designed to try to tamp down the cloud over this situation.
NOW GOP @SenPatRoberts: "We're going through a pretty rough patch" on farms.  "I don't think a lot of you realize..."    We need "certainty and predictability", he emphasizes.
Trump on tariffs: "Mostly companies are coming back to our country"   (As opposed to Harley Davidson moving production out of the country.)
Also funny.  Senate and House appropriators keep thanking POTUS for his leadership on the budget and appropriations, ignoring the fact that they have almost entirely ignored POTUS' budget.
This.   Just keeping it on folks' radar. https://t.co/LwfIarAeh7
Trump reminds appropriator lawmakers: We are going to ask for some additional money for the wall.
*Kicks self for not including* https://t.co/ygLRbOveCO
NOW: @SenAlexander pointed out to POTUS that federal discretionary spending is not the big problem.    But. Ironic on day when CBO did report on the GIANT problem coming. (Tax cuts in short term, entitlements and revenue not keeping pace in long term.)
POTUS on defending his tariffs: "Our steel industry was (about to go bust), now our steel industry is thriving."  Adds to idea that he is picking winners/losers and is ok with that. Sees steel as a critical win.
Ok after some wild and lengthy fast-forwarding and rewinding by an unknown pool staffer, apparently this tape is now playing as expected.   I promise to tweet highlights responsibly.
Also notable/funny that POTUS pushed back at that McCain 'no' vote as @SenatorCollins. who voted no on that same bill before McCain did, sat just three seats away from the president. https://t.co/4coj4GGlWJ
@Samuel_Pancakes yep.
To largely moderate group of GOP senators, Trump just brought up McCain's no vote on health care.  But notably he did refer to McCain as a "gentleman".
Sidenote about the POTUS/Senate lunch: looks like each member of Congress gets their own salt and pepper shaker.    Another chance to work together, squandered.
Stand by.   About to see feed of video from POTUS lunch w/ GOP lawmakers.   Hoping, hoping, this goes long.  And includes both substance and awkwardness.

AND FROM THE RIGHT.  @RepBillJohnson, R-OH: "The Supreme Court’s ruling today reinforced what I have said all along: The President of the United States does indeed have the final say when it comes to our immigration policy."
STRONG REACTION BOTH SIDES NOW.  From Dem and Muslim @RepKeithEllison: "Today’s ruling is unjust. Like the Korematsu decision that upheld Japanese internment camps or Plessy v. Ferguson that established ‘separate but equal,’ this decision will someday serve as a marker of shame"
NOW, @SpeakerRyan wants apologey from @RepMaxineWaters :   "There is now place for this. She obviously should apologize."

OVERHEARD from a fellow (and respected) member of the press as we wait for @SpeakerRyan:  "I didn't find a single member who said they are voting yes".  (Immigration bill.)  Note: I spoke to one.  But the wind is blowing other way now.
AND House still plans to vote on the immigration compromise tomorrow, whip team confirms to me.
NOW: H. GOP exiting their am mtg are clear that the imm compromise bill rt now does not have a chance.  Conservatives digging in for something more like Goodlatte.#1.   Jim Jordan to me: they didn't put in half the effort to whip Goodlatte 1 as this (and should have).

@LWalters45 @CapitolPolice One more positive: My friend in Cap Police knows me so well he spotted my lost laptop IN THE GARAGE (!) and knew it was mine, held it for me until today.
@LWalters45 Another positive: @CapitolPolice handled many, many scrums, short-notice meetings, reporters following congressmen and general news chaos incredibly well.
- One positive: The WH/Trump admin. held two on-record calls on the child sep. issue. Should be standard, but in recent years, it's happened too seldom.  Great steps!, as the president might tweet.  cc: @LWalters45

HOUSE GOP DELAYING COMPROMISE IMM VOTE: until Friday, McCarthy's office confirms.
RYAN NOW: says he believes Democrats may be more interested in having these issues (immigration, DACA, child separation), than solving the issues.
Q to @speakerryan: What is happening with kids already separated from parents?  His answer: HHS and DHS are working on that.  Q: How long should children be in detention?  Ryan A: We need to make sure the border is secure. And keep families together. (Transltn: didn't answer.)
RYAN: I was pleased by the president's action yesterday (to keep families together). We don't want to separate families. *Pivots back to tax cuts/economy* https://t.co/BiryjiR2qw

FWIW, @NewsHour had our correspondent @Yamiche there and we streamed the whole thing live. https://t.co/hLlJEERegm
IMMIGRATION UPDATE: A DOJ attorney told reporters on record that they know current law only allows detention of immigrant children 20 days , but are asking for a modification.  Not clear what happens if they don't get it.
NOW, McCaskill, exiting bipartisan immigration mtg: "there's a sense that's whatever the president did today, is not gonna solve the problem long term."  She added a fix is needed to make sure this doesn't happen again.
NOW:  GOP thinking of the lawsuits from the Exec Order.  Because current law does not allow detention of children.  At all.  Exec order would detain them w families.   Goodlatte just told us poss law suits are why congress needs to act.
@DanaBashCNN @RosLehtinen @CWSoftballGame We will miss her.  But her trash talk game is still strong.   That's really where that team excels anyway.  cc: @TexasTribAbby
TRUMP:   If we don't act the country will be overrun (with undocumented immigrants). But if you are strong, you don't have any heart.  That's a tough dilemma. But perhaps I'd rather be strong.

NEW - @RepLujanGrisham to my qstn about GOP plans to detain families together: "indefinitely incarcerating families seeking asylum is illegal, unconstutional and immoral."    "We are punishing these babies - since when is it ok to (do that) to a toddler?"
NOW: @RepLujanGrisham, cong Hispanic Caucus members are outside Trump/GOP meeting railing against family separation. https://t.co/ymBn1YBo8W
People. https://t.co/PbbiDzEJqE
Scratch that - apparently he went a v specific back way
Tho note - POTUS not here yet.
From inside H GOP meeting - loud applause and cheers
Here's where we are: - packed hallway for POTUS visit to H GOP  - GOP trying to get 218 votes on comp DACA/ border bill (sorta trying) - Real action today has been on smaller bills - Meadows, Cruz - dealing w family separation https://t.co/MqwR3UdgI5
I'm literally trapped in a scrum w Sen. Tom Cotton.  Cannot get out easily.
See previous tweet. Full Trump. https://t.co/90mlIUvql5
ALERT: We have full Trump right now, speaking at even in Washington.
huh.  POTUS now: "We don't want judges, we want security at the border."  I get his "enforcement first" idea, absolutely.   But this raises question - does @realDonaldTrump understand the justice process? That there is a process after someone is detained?
1. Wow. This is the Trump 2020 campaign manager. 2. So he might be interested in generating a new headline. (vs "Kids in cages") 3. Firing Sessions now could push GOP senators to actually rebel. (But hard to say.) 4. IG report does not address the legitimacy of Mueller probe https://t.co/oLobWWa43D
Dear White House,    FYI, you also have the ability to propose legislation.   If you think that is the problem with any issue in this country, you can take the lead and put something on the table.
Reminder: President Trump personally and last-minute took down the only immigration plan w/a chance in the Senate.  (It tied for getting the most votes.) https://t.co/bLh2Lxvn4W
Nielsen: we've had 300% increase in people falsely claiming to be family units.   Which tells us: they do have stats on this aspect.    But notably does NOT tell us: how many people that is.  It could be 300% increase over a few dozen.  Or a few hundred.  Or thousand. Big diff.
WARNING that a) this is devastating audio b) we don't have a lot of context, seems possible the agents are trying to calm kids with humor and talk. Or they could be brutal in a brutal job. It's not clear.   But it is very hard to hear, regardless. https://t.co/WhSGSwrFpP
THIS IS THE PROBLEM FOR FAMILIES:  "If you are thinking about 2018 (election), the truth is the family separation issue is good for both parties. And that's the problem."   (Pause) "If you're human."  - Senior Senate staffer to me
NEW GOP PUSHBACK. Longtime GOP Sen. Pat Roberts statement: "While I firmly support enforcing our immigration laws, I am against using parental separation as a deterrent to illegal immigration, my concern, first and foremost, is the protection of the children.”  *I believe its new
Pro-life Susan B. Anthony grp statement:  We are "completely dedicated to protecting the first right w/out which no other rights matter: the right to life...   Therefore we refrain frm public comment on immigration + many other topics, incl. other policies that impact families"
NEW from a key conservative pro-life group.  Susan B. Anthony list is NOT taking a stand on family separation. See next tweet...
I'm tracking two big stories, about to tweet on that but NO BARRY TROTZ CANNOT RESIGN.  #AllCaps
Based on the day so far:  We are on track for one of the  toughest days for Trump policy - and its consequences - in his presidency.  That's on tariffs and immigration alone.
GERRYMANDERING. My Question for SCOTUS (and not unique to me): SO why did they take the MD case if it wasn't something they'd rule one??
Major credit to @ctlong1 here for  explaining the @ap "exclusive".  Turns out she DID have it first.  But the @ap twitter account lagged is all.   Colleen is a class act. https://t.co/3QgB05Mb9Q
@ctlong1 Hi Colleen, just emailed you. Could you ask that "exclusive" label come down from your story? Or email back to discuss. Assuming mix-up.
@KLZimmy @NewsHour @AP You made my week right there.
@NewsHour @AP To be clear.  DHS disclosed this on a reporter conf.  call to @NewsHour.  We asked.   Forgive me. Just PBS is a humble place and while it is good that we don't brag, I can't accept big outlets taking credit for our question as an "exclusive".
Wait a minute.  @NewsHour asked and got this information.   What up with that @AP? #badday https://t.co/tAEIV0DeMn
@topjimmy @KevinGutzman @NewsHour Right - that is what the administration says it is doing. And my job is to report that, report what happens and let voters know. Many support this policy. Many question it.  But it is most certainly a change. What kind of change is up to the nation.
@KevinGutzman @NewsHour Afraid I don't follow. Manafort is charged in two indictments related to money laundering, lobbying for foreign powers and other charges.  He was with his family until FBI said he broke terms of his bail and tried to influence witnesses.  The two stories are apples/oranges.
@KevinGutzman @NewsHour Listen, I definitely understand the skepticism. I'm one who will admit - yes the media leans left. But I work to stay in the sharp middle.    Thing is, this story is driven by a policy change by the Trump admin in late April/early May. They have touted it, would want u to know.
THIS https://t.co/c6FeGm5hv0
@kendown Correct. Those were only parents being prosecuted. Not asylum seekers.
NEW FROM DHS (more):  - DHS insists the breast-feeding story is not true. That it does not separate babies.  - And says this is a question of enforcing the law or not. That it does not like separating families, but must do that rather than let parents go.
NEW ON FAMILY SEPARATION: - 1995 kids separated from parents April 18 - May 31, says DHS  - DHS sd they don't separate babies, but asked "to get back" to us on what age that applies.   - Gave hotline # for parents to find kids that when you call gives no option for parents.
DHS:  - 1995 children were separated from parents from April 18 - May 31 b/c their parents were undocumented.
FAMILY SEPARATION:  Phone call with DHS ending now. Stand by for a BUNCH of tweets.
NEWLY-PUBLIC TEXT b/t two on FBI investigation:  Aug. 8, 2016.  Lisa Page, "[Trump's] not ever going to become president, right? Rights?!"  Peter Strzok, "No. No he's not. We'll stop it."   pg 404 https://t.co/Z0akBI5Id1
DOJ IG:  - Did not believe any of the reasons given for the one-month delay by the team in NOT looking  into the Weiner laptop. (Sept-Oct 2016.) - Said politics may have been in play on that decision, but could not be proven.
DOJ IG REPORT:  - No word on whether there are criminal referrals - 5 FBI/DOJ employees are referred to agency for poss misconduct.
BREAKING: DOJ IG REPORT.  Shorter: - No evidence that political bias affected the Clinton investigation decisions the IG reviewed - But new texts do underscore that Strzok was anti-Trump. - Comey was insubordinate but acted in what he thought was FBI interest
Alright grid, I'm leaving you for a while.  To get some news and be sequestered while I get it.  See you in a couple of hours.

@RepBarragan @thehillbaseball We #BadNewsBabes will be watching.  And taking notes. (We do that alot.)
NEW: Sen. Hatch is calling up Sec. Ross to Capitol Hill for a hearing to explain the Trump tariff's.  - June 20 9am. - Hatch, "I have made no secret my concerns with the administration's use [of tariffs]."

IMMIGRATION update: - H GOP leaders didn't outline the compromise in this sm's mtg (was a political mtg) - also they haven't decided what's in the compromise yet - looks (now) like language would be out next week, close to vote time. - meantime press corps is on it (attchd) https://t.co/x6jdFsEcKP

@jamiedupree Exactly

For those who don't read the story, other key spoiler:  - It is unclear if a) House GOP can reach a compromise or b) the Senate would agree to anything the House passes.  BUT still significant that Republicans are talking family separation.
BREAKING: House GOP negotiations on immigration now include general agreement on trying some kind of legislative fix on family separation.  (Also, meanwhile the discharge petition is happening.)  My story: https://t.co/u1Ukf0o9w7

(Two injured in shooting, amazing wasn't worse.) https://t.co/tOP79YKILN

@hels @chillmage Wow. I'm similarly grateful and joining your ring of linguistic rage.
SCOTUS VOTERS. Alito slams Sotomayor, others dissenting, as trying to legislate, writing:  "The dissents have a policy disagreement, not just but with Ohio, but with Congress ... We have no authority to second-guess Congress."
SCOTUS VOTERS (more): The opinions here are sharp.  Sotomayor (dissenting): ""[The majority opinion] entirely ignores the history of voter suppression ..."    (h/t @glguray)
A BIG DEAL: The Supreme Court 5-4 just upheld Ohio's voter rolls law which automatically dropped voters who had not voted for two years or confirmed desire to vote.
@zkgrumpy Looking into the March issue - but can you explain more about the "2l? Which 2?
@realmrdean @jennymarder @sarajust @ericarhendry @VanessaDennis @tcd004 @BrennanRome Sincere thanks for the feedback.  Could you give specifics so we can fix any inadvertent issues? Believe me we spent a great deal of time trying to be balanced and play this as a straight look of what is known.

Meadows on immigration: "there is not a deal today"
GOP immigration family meeting/feud: members coming out repeat two phrases "there's progress" and "we're talking".  Both of which usually mean there's not much progress.
HOUSE GOP IMMIGRATION notes: - Marc Short was here for the WH, just left  - it's clear there is a looong way to anything that gets 218 GOP H votes, this was a family venting session about avoiding the discharge petition.
WORTH WATCHING.   (PS @mattloff didn't mention, but he was producer, shooter, writer and often navigator on this one.) https://t.co/tRliaF1Wev
THIS. IN NEW JERSEY, NOW:  We seem to have an example of a first-time candidate (@antonyghee) NOT playing by old boy network rules ... and  telling the public about very shady horse-trading being attempted.
!NOW: quite a story bubbling up in NJ-11. (Already a very hot race.)  GOP candidate Tony Ghee says another GOP candidate - Peter de Neufville - yesterday tried to persuade him and a 3rd candidate to drop out, saying he would then get them prestigious jobs in local gov.
Rough news conf now.  Almost feels reporters asking the Cavs about anything other than JR are just trying to be nice.

SCHIFF: read statement from all Dems saying there remains no evidence of misconduct by the FBI or spying on campaign.   He left and took no questions. Politely ignored the many shouted out.
SCHIFF at camera now.
Warner, now: I've never been in a gang of 8 meting with the WH present before.   He also said Kelly and Flood left before the substance of the briefing began
Answering many questions. Adding others Want to add tho that Kelly and Flood were at Capitol roughly 20 minutes. https://t.co/JeZgJM4ck0
"Apparently" bc lots of back doors in this place.
NOW: all Republicans known to have been in Gang of 8 briefing have left.  Just Dems apparently remaining. (Kelly, Flood. Rosenstein, Wray are gone.)
Coats, Rosenstein and Wray are exiting th bldg.
Well for starters there are more ppl at this one. https://t.co/NXjVW2Ju19
CLASSIFIED GANG OF 8 (+Kelly +Flood) briefing still on.  Still waiting in the basement, behind the kitchen, for them to some out. https://t.co/GdfykxP1kz

BREAKING: !Senate passes sweeping overhaul of Congress' rules on sexual harassment.  (!) Unanimous voice vote.   Now House must agree or the two pass compromise.  (A final bill is expected.)
HEADS IUP: watch Sen floor now - possible passage of Sexual Harassment bill.
RATHER EXTRAORDINARY.  Top Sen Intel Dem Warner just told a few of us:   My role in today's (gang of 8) meeting is to make sure no member (of Congress) solicits the identity of a classified informant... something that would make America less safe.
NEWS: House Ethics Committee announced former Rep. Meehan has now repaid the taxpayer funds used in the harassment settlement involving him.
Correction:  the gang of eight 2p briefing is at the Capitol.    (I deleted erroneous tweets I sent on that - full disclosure. Will always let you know when do that. I HATE mistakes like that.)
@shellie9 He's going to an earlier briefing.

SEXUAL HARSSSMENT and Congress: they have a proposal, but it is technically not final yet. For some strange reason.   @SenGillibrand statement: “Senator Gillibrand is very hopeful that a bipartisan deal is within reach and is thankful to everyone involved in the negotiations..."
BREAKING:  Senate Rs and Ds finalizing a deal on sexual harassment, mult sources tell me.   Could be announced in next hour(s).
FBI and TRUMP: Zeldin newser now calling for new special counsel is more like a mini-committee hearing.  He laid out his case date by date over 15 min or so.    Now members waiting behind him to speak one by one.
NOW: Rep. Zeldin, top Freedom Caucusers holding news conf to push idea of a new special counsel to look into the FBI, DOJ and if they targeted Trump, GOP. https://t.co/vioIzv1x2h
SEC NIELSEN: said she had not seen the Jan Intel conclusion that Russians were trying to influence 2016 election in favor of Trump  ?? I was there but want to replay the tape on that - head scratcher.#??  She later added that she thinks Russia has tried to undermine both parties.
CONGRESS AND ELEX SECURITY: just 40 members of the House or so were at today's briefing.   Even as they know Russians are actively trying to influence 2018 elex.

YET AGAIN emailing Congressional leaders  for response to a school shooting.  Already dreading the "it's too soon to draw conclusions", "we shouldn't rush to react" responses I expect to get.  I'm not for rushing to react.    But so tired of lack of real debate, thought.
ICYMI: yes that was 30 Republicans voting against and killing (for now) the GOP Farm Bill.
FARM BILL appears to be going down in House.
FARM BILL: it's not clear what a majority is today Bc of absences. It's 405-406, we think.

HASPEL GETS THE VOTES to be CIA director: Just got 51 Senate votes to clear procedural hurdle.  Next vote is confirmation.

Summary:  Women can win in the GOP.   Issue is they are not on the GOP ballot.  (At least not last night.) https://t.co/KifjgVyc2n
LAST NIGHT:  Of 27 Repubs who won House primaries, 1 was a woman. (3.7%).  Now that includes incumbents. SO...  Of 14 GOPers who won OPEN House primaries, 1 was a woman.   AND THIS ONE.  The issue: Of 39 GOP *candidates* in those OPEN races, just *2* were women.
I just ran some numbers from last night's primaries and found some rather glaring stats for the GOP.   Stand by.

OK, people.   Time to talk about Congress #MeToo and its lack of action. Two things.  1. This outstanding Op-Ed from Kate https://t.co/MZWd9wu654…  2. Watch tonight on our show our conversation w/ 3 smart, thoughtful women who want to stop what happened to them. https://t.co/iothUl0BXE
@SGT_Buttercup @WaynesDunn Case involves a man pulled over when driving a car rented by his girlfriend.  He did not give police permission to search, but police say gf's rental agreement did.  They found sig. amounts of drugs.    He argued (and won today) the search was unconstitutional privacy violation.
AMAZING BUT TRUE.  Congress STILL hasn't changed its own rules on sexual harassment complaints. System still anti-victim.  TONIGHT: I sit down w/ 3 impressive ex-Cong staffers who were harassed, including 1st TV intvw w/ Anna Kain, who was abused in Rep. Esty's office. @NewsHour
THIS.   PS. AZ primary = August 28. https://t.co/uweODocZkY
SCOTUS summary:  - States can allow sports betting (!) - Police can't search a car w/out drivers permission or a warrant, even if it is rented and the driver is not listed on rental. - Defense attnys should not overrule their client's wishes on pleas, even to save their life
@DougHeye nicely done.
Here's the Murphy v NCAA decision on sports betting (again h/t ScotusBlog): https://t.co/sgGWrEOcaB
It appears SCOTUS has ruled in favor of NJ and its ability to regulate sports betting.  (The court reversed the Third Circuit, which ruled against NJ.)
BOOM. SCOTUS has decided the sports betting case - Murphy v NCAA.  (Per ScotusBlog.)
SCOTUS TIME: Big backlog of decisions - with potential for biggies today.  Best coverage, as always, is from @SCOTUSblog  here:  https://t.co/zFBbaj59Rr

CONGRESS - NOT MUCH PEP IN THE STEP:  You can tell these folks are a) tired b) thinking about the midterms and c) looking for issues when you listen to the House colloquy underway now b/t GOP's McCarthy and Dem's Hoyer.  The usual zing is gone, both men have gotten distracted.

@Darth_Andrew777 @HotlineJosh The debate helped him. And while his supporters LOVE him, Morrisey and Jenkins do not have as many such ardent fans. It was a battle of intensity of support vs breadth... until the debate. I think Blankenship gained a little breadth.
@Ontheotherhand @paulajean2018 I did not pick up on any.  The #4 candidate we heard mentioned the most was Tom @willisforwv
@copaceticinva I see what you did there.
4. Blankenship told me he might support @JoeManchinWV if he does not win the primary. (That was Friday.)
3. Blankenship drives a car w/ NV plates. (If interest will send photo.)
2. Rep. Jenkins campaign was confusing - saw him at a gun store event where he spoke more to his staff and the few reporters there than voters.   (Though there were not many and they could argue it was a media event. Still.)
4 THINGS FROM MY TRIP TO WV: 1. I am convinced Blankenship has a real chance to win and it felt like he is leading.   We spoke w dozens of voters across state, from our plane ride there to gun shops to restaurants, he was repeatedly the most frequent choice mentioned,

FWIW:  There is a near 180 difference in tone b/t this am's Commerce hearing w/ Pruitt (combative, super camera award) and the Approps hearing now (actual conversations, measured debate).
POMPEO CONFIRMED: 57-42.  Which is one more vote than Tillerson got.  https://t.co/Ii6xiVAEEM
ANOTHER interesting moment here: GOP Rep. Lance, who unlike Costello is NOT retiring, is questioning Pruitt.  Lance is polite, but needs to show his district he can push back. He's vulnerable.
NOW: Mike Pompeo has 51 votes to become secretary of state. Nay, 52.  He's in. (Votes still coming...)
Apologies. Of course I meant "cabinet-level official" there.  (Monitoring Pompeo vote at same time and appears i cannot do three things at once well.) (Also eating a scone.) (So that's four.) https://t.co/wVgJb2ixEr
NOW: Rare moment in a House hearing. Member of governing party expressing concern about cabinet secretary of his party.  GOP Rep Costello-PA is saying there are real concerns, questions about the Pruitt stories and is asking him about each one.
NOW: final vote on Mike Pompeo to be next secretary of state.  Senate just voted 57-42 to move to this final vote. (So, that was not close.)
Rep. Cramer starting his Pruitt questions with a notable tone of high praise, almost at level you might expect from a cabinet official to @POTUS.  "I never cease to be impressed by the level of detail you know."
TN Sen. candidate Marsha Blackburn has just begun questioning Pruitt.  Watch for how pro-Trump she goes.
Meanwhile, re: the balance of (electric) power debate in the Senate... https://t.co/CN9dR6pPi6
Excellent question.  No. https://t.co/HzzpW3H512
PRUITT SO FAR: Dem Rep. Pallone is asking tough questions that are on topic and fact-based, but he is cutting off Pruitt repeatedly.    Pruitt has gotten out just a few words in response to his qs.
PRUITT CHEAT SHEET 1.Will tout reducing regulations 2.But under 10 investigtions on these issues: - Travel costs  - Lobbyist condo - Expensive office equip - Staff pay raises - Video, work w/ industry groups - Security costs - Dismissing scientists - Secret/not public email

JACKSON more from Democrats' summary of charges: - He is alleged to have have amassed a private stock of controlled substances  - He once had been the reason some percocet pills (an opioid) had gone missing... he was said to have held a supply for him to distribute.
NEW on Dr. Ronny Jackson, more from Democrats in their summary of charges: - That there was  "constant fear of reprisal" - Jackson described as "the most unethical person I ever worked with" "explosive" "the worst leader I've ever worked for", among many other similar phrases.
NEW on Dr. Ronny Jackson, from Dem summary of allegations: - One person called his prescribing "reckless" - One nurse said he wrote himself prescriptions - And that at least once he wrote a prescription to a third person to protect the real recipient of the medication. More...
1. @kanyewest is on a pro-Trump/pro-everything twitter blast right now 2. I think @EmmanuelMacron may still win for both mentions and Trump love.

COLOR NOTE for Macron entering House: Three of the four Democratic leaders sitting together imagine themselves becoming speaker in the fall.
I can confirm there is a light rain on D.C. And drivers are freaking.
NOW: Senate moving to the Pompeo nomination.   McConnell filing the first motion (cloture) to get things going. Looks like final vote Thursday, though tomorrow is possible.
SUMMARY: Trump is trying to talk Ronny Jackson out of becoming VA Secretary, the position Trump has nominated him for.
TRUMP: it is totally Ronny Jackson's decision... on whether to continue as nominee for VA secretary.
TRUMP: The Veterans Administration is so big, you could run the biggest hospital in the world and its small time in comparison. Nobody has the experience.
TRUMP on VA nominee Jackson more:  I told Admiral Jackson, what do you need this for? This is a vicious group of people...   (... we are waiting for the ending on this thought.)
TRUMP: I haven't heard of the allegations against Ronny Jackson, but he is one of the finest people i have met.

BIG HEADS UP: that JCT report out yesterday on the GOP tax bill contained incorrect numbers on two charts.  (One showed a glaring, serious cut in home ownership for the middle class)   Am told an update is expected in hours.
Per source w/ knowledge: @POTUS called @RandPaul multiple times today.    This may be the clearest personal role @POTUS has had in changing the outcome of a vote.  (Pompeo.)
COONS TAKES THE BULLET. Votes "present" for Pompeo out of respect for Isakson and the entire committee.  This means he will go to the floor w/ favorable recommendation.
Nothing can happen at a normal time in this Congress.
Menendez: let's keep the vote open until tonight.
Corker is asking that one Dem vote "present".  Seems like a long long long shot.  (?Looking at you Shaheen?)
Here we go: Corker says that they cannot overrule the rule blocking use of Isakson proxy vote. Options: 1. Hold vote open until Isakson returns 10:15p ET. 2. Hold vote tomorrow am. But that risks clock problems w/ getting Pompeo confirmed by NATO summit Friday.
Again, proving #Congress=BadAtMath.
ISSUE in Pompeo hearing: Sen. Johnny Isakson is not here, speaking at a memorial service.  That means it's 10-10 for those there. Corker is asking that Dems allow a voice vote, accept that it would be 11-10 w/ Isakson.
NOW: Senate committee vote on Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State. Watch: https://t.co/cOYiJ9LZul
Meanwhile, in Clinton investigation investigation news... https://t.co/NBxbDni96F
Pompeo vote: Coons also wants to speak... and suspect Booker interested as well. So vote still a minute away.

Cuba.  The Flake flip was about Cuba, Cornyn told us.    And - as with his DACA deal - what Flake wanted/got was simply to be in a room with someone from the WH.  No changes or votes or legislation.   (Again, per Cornyn)
BUT WHY did Flake do that? What did he get?   GOP Whip Cornyn just told us Flake wanted assurances about, wanted to talk to Pompeo about his concerns about Cuba travel restrictions.    (Yes, I want more details too.)
SENATE DAY GONE WRONG.   After the Flake fiasco just now, GOP is delaying the next nomination vote for the day. (Dept. of Ed. general counsel.)  It was scheduled for 3:15. Now TBD.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED: - GOP-led US senate, w 2 members out (Duckworth, McCain) was tied at 49-49 on nomination for a GOP congressman (NASA). -And the VP is out of town - Jeff Flake was the GOP no vote - But he just switched to yes. - Which is not the first Flake flip this yr

Also this gem in last hour from Sen. @BobCorker:   “Any Republican senator not conflicted about this presidency has been either comatose or useless in their blindness.”
OTHER CORKER NEWS: - Said he believes @MarshaBlackburn is trailing Phil Bredesen by 6 pts. "A real 6 pts." he added. - Repeated he won't campaign against Bredesen. - Pinning Iran hopes to Merkel/Macron trips to DC. - Doesnt believe Trump's concerned about nation's fiscal health.
RE: POMPEO.   Me to For. Relations Chairman @SenBobCorker just now: "Do you believe Mr. Pompeo will be confirmed?  Corker: "I hope he will be confirmed."  PS Corker said a) he did not have a heads up about Pompeo-Kim meeting and b) thinks it helps Pompeo.

THE MCCABE REPORT, simpler: 1. McCabe DID have authority to allow confirmation of Clinton probe to WSJ. 2. But IG concludes he lied about granting that approval four times, including to Comey. 3. McCabe insists this is a case of others forgetting conversations he remembers.
@rebecky75 Wow, you just made me tear up. I don't know what to say. Thank you.

Speaker battle now more interesting - just got this from Jim Jordan: ""What's important is not who the next Speaker is, but what the next Speaker does. ... If and when there is a Speaker's race, colleagues have approached me about running and that's something I'm open to doing."

This Pompeo hearing is worth watching for many reasons.  Among them, it is the best recent summary of global threats and concerns for the U.S. I've heard.
Corker sits back down.
NOTE: Chairman Corker is standing right now as this exchange over Mueller happens b/t Murphy and Pompeo.
NEW. Pompeo just testified his position on gay marriage has not changed, he believes it should not be legal.  Booker indicated he will ask more about this in a second round of questions.
Regional water joke deployed.  (CO v KS) #PompeoHearing
NOT SUBSTANCE: Pompeo's voice reminds me a lot of Vince Vaughn.
SUBSTANCE:  Pompeo is walking a tight rope here at his confirmation hearing, avoiding talk of Mueller.  But he did say just now that he would likely stay in the job should the president try to fire Mueller and spark a constitutional crisis.

RYAN: My conscience could not handle running and then announcing retirement after the election. It would not be honest.
WHAT RYAN SAID TO GOP:  that for 20 years his kids knew him as a weekend dad.  And when he became speaker he became a Sunday dad.  And he feels need to change that.
"There were years in everyone's eyes", member tells me, when Ryan spoke.  Next: what he said....
NOW; From GOP member in the room - Ryan now telling them he is not running for reelection again.

SEN NELSON = a man looking to land a soundbite on the evening news in FL tonight.
BACKGROUND:  "5 minutes" at a Senate hearing = at least 6 minutes. Usually 7 minutes.
I resent Michael Cohen/the FBI for interrupting the CBO and national debt's dominance of my Twitter feed.
CBO CHIEF has said in past 20 minutes:  - Debt will be high and rising - There is no path in current law to fix the problem  - The longer we wait, the more draconian the measures will be to fix it - Interest costs will &gt; non-defense spending  - Sorry I am depressing you
@RichardRubinDC Looks like a punt on c-corps Pg 111 -   the deduction gives owners of pass-through businesses an incentive to underreport their reasonable compensation—a tactic that has been used successfully to avoid self-employment taxes in the past and that is not available to wage earners.
CBO shorter, on current govnt path (from the report):  "The likelihood of a fiscal crisis in the United States would increase. "
This is a serious CBO report.    Most comprehensive and detailed look at the GOP Tax Cut bill yet.
MEDICARE'S medical trust fund (it's main/biggest one) will be exhausted in 8 years, predicts CBO.
CBO has this apples-to-oranges forecast, that the GOP tax cut bill will:  - Raise employee incomes on average 0.9% a year over ten years.  - Raise corporate profits an average of  7.1 percent (over without the tax cut bill) by 2028.
THE TAX CUT BILL and INCOME. CBO forecasts the GOP tax cuts will raise incomes an average of 0.9 percent over a decade. (That peaks in 2023 at 1 percent.)
CBO:  Three laws passed by this Congress together will increase deficits some $2.7 trillion over ten years.  (Tax cut bill, budget act, omnibus spending bill.)
THIS:   "The deficit that CBO now estimates for 2018 is $242 billion larger than the one that it projected..."    (This is largely b/c of the tax cuts.)
ECONOMIC GROWTH. CBO predicts:  - Avg. 1.9% GDP growth in next decade. - The GOP tax bill will raise GDP an avg of 0.7%, or 1.1 million jobs in next decade.
CBO's forecast:  - The national debt will reach 100% of GDP in ten years. IF GOP tax cuts expire as planned.  - If GOP tax cuts are continued, natl debt will reach 100% of GDP sooner.
HERE IT IS https://t.co/lRKouLyy7D
I CANNOT WAIT.  One minute. https://t.co/gjIm8X9Kkc

@joshuetree @POTUS This clears things up.
Is it not both in Queens and also on Long Island?   New Yorkers, please help.  (This adds to idea that the president was incredibly accurate with "sorta".) https://t.co/OTPweyT61I
#FakeCues https://t.co/BPkNVwRB7V
"I grew up on Long Island. Well sort of Long Island," @POTUS just now.  Fact check: True, actually. Pres. Trump grew up in Jamaica, Queens, which is the southernmost part of Long Island.  https://t.co/24ihED056A
@GuillotSr Thank you. That means a great deal.
Done. https://t.co/3f72gJxIwa
A+ reminder here: https://t.co/gxbR1nONmH
THE WALL: The DHS Sec. said the Trump administration is counting fixing/replacing old, broken wall as miles of "new wall".   (In part b/c Congress has not actually approved money for any new wall, FYI.)
NOW: DHS Sec just confirmed Natl Guard troops would not be allowed to do actual enforcement (arrests, detention).
Q: How many National Guard troops? And when?  A (DHS Sec.):  When? We hope immediately. As soon as possible. Scope? I don't want to get ahead of the governors. It will be strong. As many as needed.
The president has directed national guard personnel be deployed to the border, says DHS Nielsen now.  And "it will take time to have the details in place".
NOW: Waiting for details of what DHS Sec/ POTUS want to do with the National Guard at the border.  (Other than generally make things better.)
NEW: Office of Congressional Ethics report on TN Rep. Jimmy Duncan finds: - His campaign committee spent $ on what looks like family vacations, wedding and baby showers and family meals. - Just released: https://t.co/RDNWEw5rcW
@davlinnews You made my night, Melissa (after a nutty day). Thanks for this.
TRUMP ON SYRIA: "We will be deciding very soon. I want to pull our troops out... we will have had $7T in the Middle East as of three months ago (raises voice) we get nothing for it. ... It's time. It's time ... We are thinking about that very seriously. "
.@POTUS Trump now: "we are preparing for the military to secure the border, we will have a meeting on that with Gen. Mattis (shortly)."  Still not clear what exactly he means.

ALTON STERLING: NO CHARGES against police officers.  Louisiana's Attny. General just announced. Said: - the officers attempted arrest based on probable cause - verbally warned him and tried to control him prior to shooting - Sterling may have been intoxicated
ALTON STERLING: seems the AG is indicating there may not be charges against the police. Stand by.
NOW - ALTON STERLING: Awaiting decision from state of Louisiana on whether to charge the two police officers who shot and killed Alton Sterling in 2016.   The US DOJ has already decided not to charge.

DACA:  President Trump just said DACA recipients have been so "mistreated".  But reminder that their fate is in limbo, under threat, because of his decision to end their program
TRUMP signed the bill:    1. Showing yet again he prioritizes getting attention, knows how to do it and frequently bluffs.  2. Giving one of his most clear embraces of classic GOP spending approach - boost the military but increases elsewhere are often too wasteful.
Potus: Now.   https://t.co/W6skO9Sblo
YOU CAN WATCH POTUS - whether bluffing or ready to back up his veto threat - here:  https://t.co/W6skO9Sblo
In the unlikely chance you missed it... https://t.co/R28oMOBmWk
VETO?: to confirm what you're probably seeing elsewhere, the GOP did not see this coming when they passed the  bill yesterday.   And sidenote/apology: I'm juggling family stuff (positive things) and am sorry I have not been as on it as I want to be on big news days.
In summary:  - Congress passed a 2200-page bill containing dozens of new laws  literally in the dark of night 30 hours after posting it. - The Senate avoids what some had feared: having to work on a Friday.
HOUSE PASSES omnibus: 256-167
WHATS HAPPENING HERE: both political parties and every top leader in Washington has agreed to jam through one of the largest bills in recent history w/out allowing the public any real chance to understand it, much less weigh in.  #omnibus
Still reading...
@RichardRubinDC But does seem to allow funding for scrims with giant photo of the architect himself, should he chose.
I was ready to all-night it and get through a 1200-page omnibus.  But I have to admit, this is daunting.  And disconcerting. Leaders of both parties are jamming through a bill that the public (and most of Congress) will not have time to seriously debate/consider.
Update: The $6 billion was over two years. The $4 billion is just this current year.  (Thank you @mcampbellSD for pointing out.)
@mcampbellSD Thank you! Yes. I knew I was missing something.
To read the entire omnibus by midnight Friday, lawmakers must read 42 pages an hour for the next two days.    If they don't sleep between now and then.   Which is doable. As long as they know every obscure U.S. code reference and don't have to look anything up. (Unlikely.)
OPIODS: It appears just $4 billion in funding for the crisis is in the omnibus.    The budget handshake deal in February was for $6 billion.   I've got calls in to see if I'm missing something. But this is what GOP itself is saying.
OMNIBUS 2018: 2232 pages, votes expected in less than 48 hours.  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT: 2076 pages. Last Senate vote happened three months after it was introduced in the House.
MONSTER BILL: The omnibus is 2232 pages long.  Read it here - https://t.co/Fru17emgTF
BREAKING: am told by R and D sources familiar that the omnibus deal is DONE.  Now text going through final edits/prep for release.  (Tho timing on that still unknown.)
@JohnRingoes @NewsHour You are correct in that it is not in the bill.
NEW: What exactly is in the omnibus, including the deal on guns and health care.  https://t.co/hJSZf4CB2B
On the Senate floor, it's like a random day in May, as @SenateMajLdr McConnell just passed through another nomination and wrapped up votes for today, with no mention of the omnibus.
@MEPFuller yep
FILE UNDER: Dem enthusiasm watch. This VA county voted 75% Clinton. https://t.co/HrbSLVjF4d
Likewise I'll believe it is for a "wall" when I see it in the actual text. https://t.co/1fgUR4twSW
AND here's that statement from @SpeakerRyan's office:  "The speaker met with the president this afternoon to discuss the emerging funding bill. They had a good conversation about the wins delivered for the president, and he is supportive of the bill. "
This is called a unified response: @presssec statement re: Omnibus:   “The President had a discussion with Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell... The President and the leaders discussed their support for the bill..."  And @SpeakerRyan statement out or coming soon. (ht @ChadPergram)
@stevenportnoy Could it be "border fence"? (Which is how Hill folks are putting it.)
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN LAST 24 HOURS:  - Congress is not good at closing deals with itself - The president needs to add a 180 plot twist every time. - The Democratic party is split down the middle.  And we knew all these things months ago. Just the stakes keep getting higher.
@jordainc Read some of what's in it here:  https://t.co/hJSZf4CB2B
DETAILS of what's in the Omnibus... https://t.co/fEt0jIl5bj
Omnibus, per Dem source (cont.)  The Wall: $641 million for roughly 33 miles of "fencing" NOT a concrete wall, source insists. (POTUS wanted $1.6 B w/ no restrictions.)  ICE: No increase in agents.  No increase in detention beds.  (POTUS had requested those.)
OMNIBUS: from Dem source familiar.  - No cuts to Planned Parenthood or Sanctuary Cities.  - Gateway tunnel:  project can use increases going to Amtrak and other capital investment. (I interpret that as meaning there's no specific funding for Gateway.)  More...
STANDBY: getting a few details of what's in the omnibus draft.  Folo here.
NEW - OMNIBUS: Source familiar says no deal yet but leaders are meeting this morning to work out a few "minor outstanding items".
ISO copy editor. Must be able to work early hours. https://t.co/jkGcEABSU5

No omnibus today, folks.  Going to bed and setting the alarm for earrrrly.
@wjkno1 @NewsHour Thank you. But I should have explained my necklace?
The only 2 convos in the Capitol right now, both degrees of ridiculous: - can I  still get my big (fill in) reform bill into the even bigger spending bill? - do I need to go buy bread and toilet paper?
RAND PAUL: after hearing Paul speak at GOP lunch, Sen. Roberts told us he doesn't think Paul will slow down an omnibus vote, noted the Paul spoke briefly but "vociferously ".
NOW @SenJohnMcCain re @potus:  "An American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections. And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, Pres. Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free + fair election..."
@SKastenbaum I'm planning on it.  But not looking for it.
OMNIBUS where we are at:  - There is no bill yet.   - It will likely be 800 - 1000 pgs (+)  - House will prob. get a day to look at it.  - Many snags are GOP v GOP (in part): Gateway, guns, CSRs.  - THIS AFTER Congress had 5 months to do this. 5 weeks since this deadline was set.
"Still negotiating," writes source w knowledge on the Omnibus.  So there's that.
@jamiedupree I stand by my prediction. (Potentially at my peril.)
PREDICTION:  Giant bill: tomorrow House vote: Wednesday Senate vote: Thursday
@mixedcircuits I agree with you that this is a major, under-recognized aspect of how the president operates.  But the answer is *shrug*. Unclear.

@tsniderdvm Wow. Nice. But I so hope you are wrong.
CORNYN more:  - DACA: unlikely to be in the omnibus.  - This. THE WALL $ authorization: is connected to DACA. (Implying it may be out.)  - CSRs. He would like to see them in the omni.
CORNYN comments/updates just now:  - Banking bill: "I think it will all work out". Says he would hope House GOP would "keep the result in mind".  - Yemen: He indicated leadership wants to table the bill next week, send it back to committee.  More (including DACA!)..

SCHOOLS: House passes STOP school violence Act with just 10 no votes.  This bill frees up resources for schools to deal with security, including programs to identify potentially threatening students.
So far, not one GOP senator who has been involved in immigration talks has known about the reported potential WH DACA offer, FYI.  And a least one - Tillis - has big problems w the idea (short-term patch).
PROPS: to whomever made that large cut out of a lamb and is holding it up in the crowd.
Lamb: "Our issue in this campaign is common ground."  CC: everyone else running in a remotely close district this year. (Your problem/Lamb advantage: if people believe you when you say it.)

Some Republicans in districts Trump won by half as much as PA-18 (10 pts or less):  - Paul Ryan - Lamar Smith - Justin Amash - Devin Nunes - Dave Brat - Brian Mast - Tom MacArthur  (Of course some way outperformed the president.)
This is the better # to watch (vs the PVI #)... https://t.co/j5qAJYIVRH
Wow what a squeaker this race is.
I started thinking Lamb could do it:  When our team was working on our story in the hotel lobby in Westmoreland County and the  other people there were new Indivisible volunteers from Virginia.   (And I know - it's not over. Not saying it is.)
@MerkyH2O @ahay27 Snap! Yes!
@CillizzaCNN @ericbradner Nerd question - is that subtracting those districts help by Dems? (I count 12 of those.)
And many of whom have another election in a few weeks or (best case) months. https://t.co/L4eYtQYbN5
I count at least 98 GOP congressional districts where Trump won by 20 points or less.
I wonder at their use of "Key Race Alert" on a night when they are following one race.
I really think CNN's giant map is awesome. But...
PA-18.  With 10% reporting:  Lamb 60.6% Saccone 38.8%
PA-18 - FIRST VOTES!   With 0.51% reporting (I know), it's: Lamb 51.95%  Saccone 47.24%.

ANOTHER REMINDER: Republicans currently have 50 members regularly voting (w/ McCain in treatment).    They need every one of them to vote yes for the CIA nominee. (Or get Democrats on board.)

FOR. RELATIONS CHAIRMAN CORKER: I talked to POTUS Friday night, did not talk to him until this am.  We tried but could not reach Tillerson today.  Pompeo is excited about his new role.
Five of President Trump's cabinet members are currently under fire for serious ethics or ability questions.  But he fired a different one.
Also, this is not infrastructure week.
REMINDER: Republicans have 51 members in the Senate.  And will need 50 votes for the new CIA director nominee who once oversaw a detainee torture program.   (Pompeo will be a key salesman - he got 66 votes as CIA director)
@geoffreyvs Except. It is also a day of quick turns.
Full Schumer statement: "The instability of this administration in just about every area weakens America.   If he's he’s confirmed, we hope that Mr. Pompeo will turn over a new leaf and will start toughening up our policies towards Russia and Putin.”

@tamarakeithNPR So here's what worked (possibly too well) the best.  I deleted every unread email past a certain date. It felt good. If dangerous.   How: I went to "Folder" and then "New Search Folder" (!?) then chose "unread mail".  Then highlighted all past certain date. DELETE.

@kenblair75 You know, I nearly did. But it just felt like overkill. Twice.
TRUMP: says he is starting the "process" on tariffs.  Still unclear exactly how this will work.
But   Tariffs are not in the pledge. Tariffs are not in the pledge. (Etc.)  https://t.co/3eFdOshDwj https://t.co/sWUckqRf0i

SCHUMER on the WH upheaval: The mess ups we've seen this past week we will see over and over again.    No one wants to go (work in the WH).
VA SEC SHULKIN: says he spoke to president @realdonaldtrump about the VA problems and his restructuring plan last night.
SHULKIN: Insists "I was unaware of those problems"... as he announces major VA restructuring in response to new IG report.  Reminder: He has been a VA leader (was undersecretary) since 2015
This is a photo of joy and beauty.  Congratulations @Yamiche https://t.co/ubJjZP8h7m
RYAN NOW on tariffs: there is clearing dumping of steel and aluminum by china. But I think the way to go is to be more "surgical".
HOUSE GOP: announces they will vote in Rep. Rutherford and a Deutch's  anti-school violence bill next week.  It gives grants to schools to help ID potential threats, students who may become violent.
HOUSE GOP uncomfortably divided on tariffs - am told some openly opposed them in their closed-door meeting. Most members trying to walk a tricky line... "it's complicated" "it's regional" "we want to help the president"
Whoa. https://t.co/C1Fsi8SAb6
@S_Storm_Hansen I could not agree more that "breaking" is overused + nearly meaningless. However, when the sitting chairman of one of the most powerful committees in the country resigns unexpectedly, and during a hard-fought slog of spending on epic proportions, it seems to me that qualifies.
NEXT IN LINE: to chair Sen. Appropriations is @SenShelby, who currently chairs Rules Committee.
BREAKING: Appropriations Chairman Thad Cochran resigning in less than a month, citing health concerns.  This as House and Senate negotiate one of the largest appropriations bills in U.S. history.
@ringer CC: Everyone involved in The Color Purple.
SO PROUD and have tears of joy  flowing for @Lyrikris10 and Bobby Lopez.   I know Kathy Lopez is so proud of her boy and his beautiful family tonight. She feels your love.   @Lyrikris10, so well said.
TODAY: - Senators proposing serious gun bills. But no one paying attn bc... - POTUS launches historic tariffs, poss trade war. - Hicks leaving - Kushner multiple exclamation pt stories - Sessions feud again - AND btw a literal wind storm is about to hit Washington.
HATCH.. more of his statement on tariffs and the president's decision:  "... I encourage the president to carefully consider all of the implications of raising the cost of steel and aluminum on American manufacturers and consumers."
WOW. Hatch, one of president's most reliable Senate allies just put out this statement:  "“Tariffs on steel and aluminum are a tax hike the American people don’t need and can’t afford...”
@jjshaka already has happened. Sorghum farmers feeling financial pain from retaliation over washing machine and solar panel limits Trump put in place.
AG COUNTRY V UNHAPPY.  KS SEN ROBERTS: after hearing the news of new steel, alum. tariffs by Pres. @realDonaldTrump, "what part of agriculture will now be retaliated against by which countries?"
BURR: just told us reporters he and Warner did NOT talk to Speaker Ryan about concerns over Devin Nunes.  Said he had "no ask" of the speaker.
@pkcapitol Though, Hicks hasn't resigned yet.  Tillerson could pull an Eagles-style late surge on this.
This tells me that GOP senate staff still don't get it w/ @realDonaldTrump.  Amazed they still think things are working by the prior rules. (And that he is a president who cares about briefings.)   What they should be thinking is about whether any of that mattered at all. https://t.co/Tlbp0Az7E6
PENCE: is now tied for most tie-breaking VP votes since 1870.    At this rate, he could give all-time record holder John C. Calhoun (31 tie breaks) a run for his money.
Let me engage in wild ridiculous speculation, if briefly. (We at PBS try to do this a maximum of once a year.)  Comms Dir. Ivanka Trump?
Hope Hicks' impending resignation as comms director is the best communicated staff change of the Trump presidency.
WEST WING reminder:  Hope Hicks = @Toby_Ziegler
HOPE HICKS. A very good close-to-POTUS source once told me:  She is the one who goes in, really the only one who knows how to talk to him, when we have bad news.
Analysis: WaPo got this headline wrong.  President @realDonaldTrump wanted this meeting to go exactly as it did.    Unclear: if it will work. Clear: This tactic is driving Cap Hill crazy. And that's why Trump was elected. https://t.co/Vi2G85nYMW
I was wrong!  (When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong.)
Prediction: at least one more Republican will try to speak after Deutch.  (See previous tweet.)
The part where everyone tries to have the final word.    (Esp. key now that all of DC believes Trump goes with the last thing he heard.)
MCCONNELL, RYAN, NRA right now: https://t.co/h4tZSTrTSO
WOW. POTUS just broke with much of House GOP - slamming the idea of including concealed carry in the Fix NICS bill.  "You'll never get it passed. We want to get something done."
POTUS on arming teachers: They are not going to go into the school if they know they are going to come out dead.  ISSUE: the shooters at Columbine, Newtown and VA Tech killed themselves inside the schools,  and may have planned on coming out dead.
SEN DAINES: The only thing worse than doing nothing is doing something that does not achieve the intended results.  (Hard not to infer he is making the argument for potentially doing nothing... which many conservatives defend, just not so directly)
Rather amazing.  President Trump is directly, bluntly accusing lawmakers of being afraid of the NRA, as the reason they won't raise the age to buy assault rifles.
SEEMS CLEAR: from this gun conversation, POTUS is looking to support something that Obama and other presidents did not support or at least failed to pass.
HEADS UP - words we like to see:: "President Trump has asked the press stay in the room for an extended period of time during the meeting with lawmakers. "  (Re: guns meeting at 3p today. )
@dack @NewsHour @WmBrangham @jenklise Aw thanks!!  I still like "unpack" but this is motivating me to look for other terms to use in rotation too.
@MauriceSerico It's true and drives me bananas too.  The US used to have roughly the same color code until 2000, but it was not often used.  Then NBCs Tim Russert launched the current Red=GOP, blue=Dems method and it stuck, in part bc that election got so much coverage and for so long.
@NicoleKowalski5 @tamarakeithNPR Oh gosh.  I need feedback like this if my questions are not helpful.  Can you send more specifics on what frustrated you and what I could have done better?
@dack @NewsHour @WmBrangham I'm not opposed but could you provide a bit more? Why?
@EdDixon937 yes! I love it Ed.
Very unhappy I am not at this - unable to make it today. But folks should tune in. https://t.co/8fU4hvWbUF
NOW: President Trump suggests  $1000 bonus for teachers who become trained to conceal and carry guns in schools.  Also says he is against adding barrier doors or smoke dispensers as solutions (says someone brought that to him as a real plan).
NOW: @flotus Melania Trump seems to be launching a  campaign to protect children... telling governors' spouses her office will be reaching out.
Did I hear this correctly?  Sounded like the President just said that while the NRA wants change,  at other times "we are going to have to be tough and fight them" on some issues.
ONE MORE POTUS:  - Said needs to be immediate access to taking guns away from someone like the FL High School shooter.
POTUS now: - Insisted he will get bump stocks banned. (As essentially "machine guns") - Again pushed for more mental institutions (from "in the old days") - Called again for arming well-trained teachers - Said he had lunch w/ NRA ldrs + they "want to do something"
fwiw, cc: @caphilltrish @MLevineReports @JTSantucci @maggieNYT
NEW re: RICK GATES: from source close to the investigtion.  - Gates and his attorney are hoping for no jail time b/c of this plea. (It's up to the judge.)  - Gates was back and forth on the plea and decided in last 48 hours.  - Next things to watch: 1) Kushner? 2) POTUS intvw?
NOW: reporter asked the Australian PM about his country's move to essentially ban semi-automatic weapon and it's lack of mass shootings as Pres @realDonaldTrump stands next to him.
@KimNativeSD Thank you for everything in this email!
@ellisislandkim CORRECTING: This is called a "superseding criminal information document", not an indictment.  BUT the gist is correct - it does lay out two charges against Gates, superseding the previous.  (Again, thanks to @ellisislandkim )
NEW GATES INDICTMENT POSTED:  Now 2 counts against him (down from 31).  Lying to FBI and conspiracy.  https://t.co/Ld5OwrWIUI  h/t @ellisislandkim
@kackleyZ on it.
@kackleyZ Oh my goodness - great spot.  We are correcting NOW.
And for those focused on crisis/the news: Here's our full Gates piece... https://t.co/fXzVms4f7b
CRISIS BREAK: a much-needed one.  New song for @FrozenBroadway by my dearest friends @Lyrikris10 and #BobbyLopez... offers some hope to anyone w/ dark questions. Elsa is on it.  (And it's really good.)  https://t.co/pvfMviqY9y
WE HAVE CONFIRMED: Rick Gates will plead guilty today in a deal with prosecutors, I'm told by someone close to the investigation.  Expected in court at 2pm today.
RIGHT NOW: what we have folks is a full Trump.    Full Trump. [ful trump]. noun. When President Trump is at his least scripted, most impromptu (and often Twitter like) in front of a microphone.  *retweeting for slight grammar correction*

@KimNativeSD Hello Kim. I'm a big fan of SD.  Hmm. Interesting and sincere thank you for the feedback on the glasses, tell me more. I get a lot of reaction the other direction (we love them!) so want to adjust if it's just a case of them really being distracting.
@ScottLabuda @1a It's a good question. From my end, my email is just overrun (on lists of 535 members of congress) and it's easier to focus on questions and have good interaction on Twitter.  Tweet at me anytime.
In which chants of "Lock her up!" return, at CPAC, more than a year after Hillary Clinton lost the general election.
LOVING this @1a conversation at CPAC.
THIS: NRA's LaPierre now, "the rank and file in each institution must police" their leadership, i.e. must be ready to block what they see as unlawful from highers up in government.
NRA is on offense today, w/ CEO LaPierre *sharply blasting* this list as causes of violence: - the media - the Democratic party - the FBI - the intelligence community
NRA's LaPierre now: is accusing the Democratic party of being rife w/ anti-American, anti-Democracy infiltrators.
VITRIOL WATCH. Not helpful for a real conversation.  NRA (now): Do we really love our money and our celebrities more than we love our children?  NRA opponents: Do we really love our guns more than we love our children?
Flagging this b/c @karol heard this differently than I did - FYI. (Can replay after this ends or at next commercial to check.)  Thanks @karol for the backstop. https://t.co/nJUBxBxubi
RUBIO: I don't support concealed carry by teachers... don't support idea teachers should have guns for school protection.
Q5: We'd like to know why do we students have to be the ones to do this - to march on Washington, to save innocent lives?  A5 -Rubio: you are right. What you've lived thru is not supposed to happen. It is unfortunate we have not been able to make progress on major issues.
Essentially: Rubio is saying that you have to ban all semi-automatic guns or none at all.  And that GOP will not support banning all.  Deutch is saying heck yes, let's ban them all. (And the crowd is on its feet.)
Rubio: The problem is my colleagues do not support banning every semi-automatic weapon in America.  Deutch: if a gunman can do this in seven minutes, that gun should be banned.  Rubio: my point is there would still be thousands of weapons avail. that could do that.
@MarissaLatta @senmarcorubio Thank you!  This is a larger discussion. I see it as more of a headline - does that make sense?
Q4 from student who hid during shooting: how was a kid with history of mental, discipline issues able to get this gun?  ANSR 4:from @RepTedDeutch - dozens of times this kid had problems. we need a gun restraining order to block people like this from getting a gun.
The moment 2018 politics enters the scene.  (When @SenBillNelson slams FL gov and possible Senate challenger Rick Scott for not showing up to the town hall.)
Q3 from injured shooting survivor: What are you going to do to strengthen background checks?  ANSWR 3: @SenBillNelson says he would push to close the gun show loophole.
.@senmarcorubio: I want to explain the problem w/ the assault weapons ban.  Rubio: The definition is too broad - bans 200 models. (Dad, crowd: good, good!). But similar guns can remain legal.  Dad: would you start w/ the 200 and work your way up?  Rubio: doesn't answer
ON ASSAULT WPNS: @senmarcorubio says "if I believed (banning) assault weapons would have prevented this, I would have supproted it..."  Dad: my daughter was gunned down, I can't believe you can stand here and say that.
ANSWR from @senmarcorubio: Let me explain.  I said the problems we face can't be solved by gun laws alone.  Dad: Were. guns. a. factor??  Rubio: of course they were.  I will support a law that takes away rt to buy a rifle at 18, bump stocks, and boosting background checks.
Q2 from dad whose daughter was killed, to @senmarcorubio:  "Your comments, and those of our president, have been pathetically week.  (crowd cheers)  Look at me and tell me that guns were a factor - and you accept it and you will do something about guns."
A1 from @RepTedDeutch:   As a starter **we are going to introduce legislation to make sure assault wpns are illegal**.   Also will tell you that you stand with law enforcement to help keep you safe.
Q1 from HS senior whose brother was killed:   What reassurances can you give to make sure we don't fear being killed in our classrooms?
@v_duuhhhb looks like CNN is streaming it online! https://t.co/cyEWwaQaoT
@v_duuhhhb you know I'm not sure. Stand by.
.@senmarcorubio to students in FL: you should push for (changes in gun laws) but you can also change how we talk about politics in America.
NOW: CNN continuing the important conversation about violence and guns.. but this time in auditorium with thousands of ppl who survived and lost in Parkland... and now can ask ?s of their lawmakers directly.  Worth watching, I highly suspect.
Hmm. cc: @AGJeffBSessions https://t.co/F3Z2HUaM51
@EconWrap That's good pushback and I appreciate it - keep us in check. Fwiw, I asked the WH who chose these participants. But beyond all that, I do think that all of these people had legitimate perpectives, worth hearing, as those directly involved.
POTUS NOW: We are going to go very strong into: - Age of purchase  - The mental health of the person involved. - And we'll look at the institutions
@IvanTheK apparently
This is a very fair point. Well said. https://t.co/eAccqgzYSR
@bbarrettNC see my full thread...
This is the real, hard gun conversation - at least the start of one - that our lawmakers have been avoiding for two decades.
IMPORTANT POINT: That @NicoleHockley just raised to @POTUS... very few of the mentally ill are threats to become violent. It's critical to ID that subgroup, but it is a small subgroup.  Unclear if POTUS had been aware of that.
President Trump deserves credit for surveying the room on both sides of the concealed carry issue - asking who was in favor and also who against, recognizing it's a divide.
@RealBenLund that is arguably a much more relevant topic and there is light to shed there I think.
THIS THIS https://t.co/xNFzQA2fAB
AND NOTABLE on mental health, POTUS:  "Mental health hospitals... a lot of them closed."  He said now when they "catch them", there's no place to put them. No institutions.   He seems to have a pre-90s view of mental illness, esp. violent mental illness.
Pres. Trump: Concealed carry (in schools) only works when you have ppl very adept at using weapons."
Pres. Trump: "Background checks are going to be very strong"
@markaestrada Samuel Zeif's remarks just now.
Just wow.
This is powerful - what parents and children are telling the president. Worth watching. Now. https://t.co/1yMPqpmQrK

STUDENTS MARCHING across the country.    Take a look.  (This thread)
STANDBACK for a big thread coming!    Long retweet list of the high school and student protests sweeping across the nation.
@KathleenConcan6 @UncleBeebaw GAH. This was definitely not something I intended to do. Suspect it was result of a misguided look into a Twitter app to help me "connect w/ followers" better. BLECH. BOO.    Deleting now. And thank you for pointing out.
MAJOR PROPS: To the great @BrookeBCNN who - in the past few hours today - has led some of the best conversations I've seen on guns all week. Including good deep-dive on the SCOTUS  Heller decision now.   Kudos to her and her producing team.
@TomPerez @LacyClayMO1 But question for you @TomPerez: As you cheer on students, what specific changes do Democrats want?
@truth_for_tmrw you me same page
SORTING OUT: the process here on the president's push for a bump-stock ban.  If DOJ needs to go through lengthy rules-change process or no.
BREAKING: Pres. Trump signed memo to ban bump stocks and other devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns.  Expects that action to be finalized "soon". (?)
NOW Pres. @realDonaldTrump: "We must do more to protect our children... school safety is a top priority for my administration."
THIS. In WH briefing now, @PressSec said:  - The idea of blocking AR-15, other gun sales to teens is "on the table". - The idea of an assault weapons ban is not off the table.
this... so impressive. https://t.co/Rr7fEY5XH4
On CNN now:  Q to Douglas HS student: Is there anything you'd like President Trump to do?  Student: Anything. Do anything.
Mitt Romney today,: https://t.co/VEMjCvpkoE
WE DON'T KNOW:  - Where this fits in the Russia investigation - The name of "Company 1" whose data was targeted  - What Pinedo knows that the FBI gave him a plea deal for. - How to pronounce his name.
(H/t to @glguray on spotting that overlooked plea deal Mueller just dropped.)
NEW NAME in RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: Richard Pinedo.  Mueller's team just dropped a plea deal w/ him, saying: - he ran a bank fraud scheme - trafficked in stolen US identities and bank account info.  - he worked w/ ppl outside the US. - Russia not mentioned. (yet)
"Project Lakhta" = Russian code name for all of this, says DOJ.  "Lakhta" also  = skyscraper in St. Petersburg that is Russian state energy giant Gazprom's new HQ. And the tallest bldg in Russia and Europe.  = lake near St. Petersburg.  (St. Pete's is Putin's hometown also.)
ROSENSTEIN now:   Russians state goal was to spread distrust toward the candidates and toward the election system in general.
2 MIN. warning to Deputy AG Rosenstein speaking.   WATCH HERE: https://t.co/Bj7htKObqG  @NewsHour
MUELLER CHARGING that Russians:  - Worked against Clinton, Cruz and Rubio. - Worked to support Sanders, Trump.
IN PAST 48 HOURS: - The U.S. officially charged Russians with intervening in 2016 elex. - 17 people were killed in mass shooting in FL HS - Senate epic fail on 2 issues (DACA, border security) affecting millions of ppl, where voters agree. - And # of headlines on POTUS and women.
@DrewDawg @OnPointRadio @michaelcrowley Finally, on the notion of the assault weapons ban, there is notable criticism from the left of Dem ldrs who - this is factual - have not clearly pushed for such a ban in many yrs.   That is not saying each  side is equal/the same  - it is pointing out where each side is/is not.
@DrewDawg @OnPointRadio @michaelcrowley In addition, I pointed out that President Trump in 2000 wrote that he supported the assault weapons ban. And now is not using the word "gun" at all.
@DrewDawg @OnPointRadio @michaelcrowley I pointed to what I experienced which was members of Congress (in both parties) seemingly not as affected by the shooting Weds. pm.  Then I went on to say how Speaker Ryan had answered my question, dodging the gun issue and pointing to a watered-down mental hlth bill.
@DrewDawg @OnPointRadio @michaelcrowley I completely hear you and am always on the watch for false equivalency in any direction.  But I'm not sure that that's what happened in our segment today.
@DrewDawg @OnPointRadio @michaelcrowley Thank you for the feedback, sincerely. But I don't recall saying that.
@KaraGormleyM @OnPointRadio You made my day Kara. And I needed to see your sunny face this week. Helps.
IMMIGRATION SUMMARY: The only thing 60 Senators agree on is that the president's plan should not become law.
WOW. The Senate voted down the president's immigration proposal 39-60.  cc: The House of Representatives
NOW: Senate to vote on the president's immigration proposal, sponsored by Sen. Grassley.  It needs 60 votes.
DEM NO's on the bipartisan immigration plan:  Harris Heinrich Udall
SENATE BIPARTISAN BILL FAILS: 54-45. Needed 60.
NOW: The big vote. This is the bipartisan compromise that seems to have the best chance to pass the Senate 60-vote threshold.   That said, it also appears it is short.
TOOMEY AMENDMENT to crack down on sanctuary cities FAILS 54-45.  Dems voting yes: Donnelly, Manchin, McCaskill, Stabenow.  All Republicans voted yes.
NEXT UP: Toomey's amendment on sanctuary cities.
MEANWHILE Sen. Collins spent that vote expressing extreme frustration - from the gallery it looked like she was irate that the bipartisan Rounds-King amendment has been labeled the "Schumer" amendment.
MCCAIN-COONS defeated 52-47.  This bill has a 8-13 year path to citizenship and less money for border security than othrs.  GOP yesses: Flake, Gardner, Graham, Murkowski Dem no: Manchin.
ANOTHER SENATE VOTE CHEAT SHEET:  - Coons-McCain (vote #1) = Hurd-Aguilar. Same thing.  - "Schumer" = Rounds-King = Collins-Manchin bipartisan plan  - Grassley = Trump
