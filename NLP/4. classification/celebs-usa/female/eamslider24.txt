@MattAntoine @IBSFsliding @USABS I appreciate the discussion Matt.  Hard to read tone on Twitter but I appreciate looking at things from all sides and considering all factors.  We as athletes should be active in growing our sports.  Thanks
Congrats! https://t.co/hPXcBw32m7
@MattAntoine @IBSFsliding @USABS Sorry last one- they should've added team skeleton event and I have no idea why that failed.  Would've been fun to watch and could've been more competitive than individual events
@MattAntoine @IBSFsliding @USABS But let's be real 4man is still king of sliding sports so definitely not suggesting to get rid of it.  But if they limit the number of athletes, limiting a 4man field to 20 sleds like all the other disciplines creates room for 40 more athletes for something else
@MattAntoine @IBSFsliding @USABS Dont think your sexist at all.  But also was referring to bobsled as well with the # of sleds.  Men's bob has 120 athletes compared to women's bob- 40, men's skele- 30, and women's skele- 20.  There's a way to make those numbers more equal.

@Ath4Hope Me too!
@FancyPantsMer @BestofDieWurst That's probably going to be me tonight
🤯😫😥 https://t.co/R5YlDhPLFS
@MattAntoine @IBSFsliding @USABS Also- if you can't add numbers of athletes I don't see a problem with having all disciplines only have 20 or 25 sleds to add more events.  Why should men have 30 sleds and women only 20?
@MattAntoine @IBSFsliding @USABS I'm for adding men's opportunities too and believe men should have access to sports and the IOC should add more athletes to make room.  But if the IOC limits the number of athletes, why shouldn't it be a 50/50 split?
.@USARugby women's team dominates game 1!  💥💥💥
Awesome https://t.co/DaiWq35kXs
@BarretBanking 😥
@Rapieress @NBCSportsGold That's awesome!  I'll have to purchase the package on @NBCSportsGold - sorry about your Dad but I love the impact rugby had to help overcome

@LewisOlliePetty Exactly!
Play starts today for the @WorldRugby 7s world cup in San Francisco!  Who's excited??? @WorldRugby7s @USARugby
We are with you! @WomensSportsFdn https://t.co/bdsyLQ5qQw
I am moving extremely slowly this morning after babysitting my 3 yr old nephew and 2 yr old nice last night 😮 so this is what having kids is like???
Had a call yesterday with @Ath4Hope and dozens of other athletes who want to create real change in the world. It takes all of us to move the needle and make a difference on this planet. Excited to see where this movement goes next.
@MattAntoine @IBSFsliding @USABS Not ideal for men's skeleton but equality is important and if the IOC won't increase the athlete numbers they had to take them from somewhere.  Men's skeleton is now in the same boat as women's skeleton has always been in.

This is why we all have to do more. https://t.co/lqk6iXBpVL
@OlympicStatman @RachelAxon It doesn't necessarily if the current pilots just do monobob too - but hopefully yes it will being more pilots- time will tell
@brashergal Whole different bobsled
@brashergal @ToddBehrendt It's the event for the youth Olympics and it's seen as less costly
@CherylPreheim Still going to go for two medals though- just not in the event I was working towards
@StaceySchramm Have to! 😁
@BubsandJacks Not necessarily- women who do 2man can also do monobob.  Also people who currently do 2man might only do monobob.  Time will tell
@danie_bagel Thanks Danie!
Thanks for having us!  Honored to be here https://t.co/Xq0y98DktE
Congrats!! https://t.co/oaIWM3Ttfi
@OlympicStatman @RachelAxon Never driven a monobob- it's typically resevered for beginning pilots.  But each sled is different and requires experience
@bsnider_22 😉
In great news- there is women to be added for women's skeleton to get closer to reaching gender equality.  That's huge!!! @IBSFsliding @USABS
To be clear the monobob discipline weighs heavily in my favor- I am one of the fastest if not the fastest- pushing pilots in the world.  However, 4-woman adds female athletes to the sport, which continues to grow the sport.
Definitely awesome to have another event and to have more women in general, but monobob is not an event most of us have ever done nor does it add numbers to women's bobsled https://t.co/b6sLm0UwQ8
@redveale @90ft2home @NBCOlympics Yes.  Adding opportunities is great, but true equality would be numbers
@AndreaG114 @90ft2home @NBCOlympics There have been quite a number of us doing the ground work to add it, including competing against men.  Wasn't more popular because it wasn't a medal event
@ToddBehrendt Yes very much so.  Have been working towards it
@NickHopeTV @RachelAxon @OlympicStatman My understanding was that they proposed 4-woman and pitched monobob as a backup.
Although I am excited the IOC has decided to add another event for women in bobsled, I am disappointed that it is not he 4-woman event, the event the women requested.  Adding the monobob, although it adds a medal... https://t.co/jbqwczwMOb
@CantbTAYmed Nope or brakemen would Drive
@NickHopeTV Monobob doesn’t add any numbers- it just takes the same athletes in the sport and gives them another chance.  Plus if countries have minimal investment in monobob and costs, why do 2man?
@CantbTAYmed Yes it’s used for beginner pilots
Although I am excited that women have another event in the Olympics, I am disappointed that it is not the 4-woman event as the female bobsledders requested.  Unfortunately monobob does not add women to the sport and does not give us equal numbers to the men. @NBCOlympics
@MariamaJamanka Thanks for all your efforts!
@alysiarissling This is discouraging
@CantbTAYmed One person in a sled 😞
@ToddBehrendt Not the preferred event by any of the women’s bobsledders 😞
Wow!  Monobob???? https://t.co/DOpft1xgrK

@caitlyndiaz218 Thanks for your comments
Update: @Delta has resolved the issue.  Thanks everyone
@caitlyndiaz218 😂
@lakez @Delta Thank you
@CharlieComenget @Delta Yep and had no problem if that was the issue.  It's also an FAA rule violation to move around the plane while it's moving in an active runway.  They had ample time to move my seat before then, but hey have resolved the issue
👊🏾🔥 https://t.co/rtk0f97ZOR

.@Delta reimbursed me for my seat change but still crazy embarrassed...someone getting up and having to change seats while the plane is moving on the tarmac makes me look horrible

The plane was already moving down the tarmac!  @Delta Not only that it was to my hometown Atlanta- so I get up and it looks like I did something wrong- in front of the whole plane to my hometown airport 😳 so very embarrassed 😞

@EvanDunfee @StuartMcMillan1 I think only luge has sprint events- we don't have any.  They've talked about the team event for bobsled/skeleton but I dont see that happening.  Personally would like another event at the games

@OfTheWilds @ArtemisPics @lagibbs84 thank you
@2irish2Cj @lagibbs84 Thanks CJ
@BHappy_4Now @chi_picks @lagibbs84 @trouble_tx You make a lot of assumptions about me without knowing me.  For example, did you know my father immigrated from Panama?  No love for a fellow Hispanic trying to represent?
@NoStressTalton Thanks Nigel
@BHappy_4Now @chi_picks @lagibbs84 @trouble_tx I'm confused about this entire thread 🤷🏽‍♀️
@PaulGerke Haha but at least there was Chipotle
@privatehatch It wasn't a full sentence 🤣
Thanks https://t.co/0zCMZjx5AF
Happy birthday https://t.co/kDNclUdWLT
Awesome stuff! https://t.co/C5FMGsFpym
@PaulGerke Oh that makes for a long day!  Glad you made it home
@BHappy_4Now @chi_picks @lagibbs84 @trouble_tx I don't live in a bubble, it would be very difficult to bobsled if I did.  There's not even air bags in there!
@BHappy_4Now @chi_picks @lagibbs84 @trouble_tx Excited and more medals should not be in air quotes, it's not necessary.  Additionally, u is a letter, not a pronoun.  Finally, your comparison makes no sense.  Thanks
@TJHClay @lagibbs84 Thank you
@RunningRev Thank you
@BrightFame34 Thanks so much
@rebadow_donna @USABS @TeamUSA Thanks Donna

@Blahbla21504393 @ilovethecfl @Militerryman @NBCOlympics @lagibbs84 @TeamUSA @USABS Don't get me wrong- Gus is great.  We just choose to affect change differently.  My belief in Christ will always be my guiding compass
@Bravehart500 Thanks
@ilovethecfl @Militerryman @NBCOlympics @lagibbs84 @TeamUSA @USABS Me screaming that I don't agree with certain policies just comes off as another angry black woman.  The only way to influence real change is through diplomacy
@Militerryman @ilovethecfl @NBCOlympics @lagibbs84 @TeamUSA @USABS Thanks for your service
.@lagibbs84 and I work hard to ensure we're positive examples of our race, ethnicity, and gender.  Choosing to spread love is never a bad thing, even if it's explaining bobsled to a politician's daughter.  The only way to fight hated and bigotry is through love
