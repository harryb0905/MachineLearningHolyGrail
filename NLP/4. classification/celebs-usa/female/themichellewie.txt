Thanks so much for hanging out, everyone! #SummerOfStarKist was awesome! Enjoy your active, sunny days ☀
@aloraann5793 That’s another one of my top workout songs right now; That song gets me movin’ every time!
I can’t stop listening to All The Way Up by @RealRemyMa It always pumps me up during my workouts #SummerOfStarKist
Sadly, the party is coming to an end. Let’s finish strong with one last question and prize! #SummerOfStarKist
Q5: What summer song gets you moving? Use #sweeps &amp; #SummerOfStarKist in your response to be eligible to win
Who’s sticking around for Charlie’s after party?! #SummerOfStarKist
That’s an amazing resolution, @SarahLayne4  Best of luck!; If you put your mind to it, you can do anything…trust me 👍
This summer I want to stay as active as possible, whether it’s golfing, swimming, hiking or walking my dog 💪#SummerOfStarKist
Q4: What’s your summer resolution? Use #sweeps &amp; #SummerOfStarKist in your response to be eligible to win
I don’t know about you, but summer always re-energizes me, which usually means creating a summer resolution list #SummerOfStarKist
@JVine1986 Mmm That flavor is delicious!; I know it was difficult for me to pick, too…SO many new, yummy flavors now 😁
For me it’s the new Kid’s Creations Honey BBQ tuna but honestly all 10 #StarKistCreations flavors are so good!  #SummerOfStarKist
Q3: What’s your favorite #StarKistCreations flavor to snack on while on the go? Use #sweeps &amp; #SummerOfStarKist in your response
That’s a great way to stay active; Keep it up! What a good idea… I’ll need to remember that one!
Eating well on the road is also tricky. But thankfully, #StarKistCreations makes it waaay easier #SummerOfStarKist
Q2: How do you stay active during busy summer days? #SummerOfStarKist Use #sweeps &amp; #SummerOfStarKist in your response to be eligible to win
Even if it’s just a couple of jumping jacks or squats, I always try to stay active while on the road #SummerOfStarKist
My summers are always full of traveling, which means a lot of long flights and car rides #SummerOfStarKist
@mugsy1976 I love doing that, too!; That’s so much fun!; Definitely adding picnics to my list!
I love golf practice in the sun, followed by dinner with my squad #SummerOfStarKist
Q1: What do you love doing outside in the summer? Respond w/ #SummeOfStarKist &amp; #sweeps for a chance to win a StarKist prize pack
Is everyone ready for the first prize question? #SummerOfStarKist
Okay, let’s get this party going, people! 🤘 #SummerOfStarKist
Now, throwing it over to @StarKistCharlie with the party rules #SummerOfStarKist
@StarKistCharlie will hook 5 fans up with fun prize packs, featuring an autographed golf ball from yours truly and more #SummerOfStarKist
I’m SO excited to chat about sunny days, getting outside and whatever else comes up! 😃 Who’s ready?!

Spent all day running test and taking MRIs on my left hip/leg. Doc says I have bursitis on my hip and we have a great plan...
The @KingsmillLPGA Championship is one of my favorite events and I would like to thank the tournament staff and fans for their hospitality.
Regrettably, I need to withdraw today due to a left hip injury that has been bothering me this week.
