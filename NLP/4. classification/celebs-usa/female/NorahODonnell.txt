‚ÄúTo me what was so troubling was how nakedly partisan he was. And I think the principle of a judicial review being absent of partisanship is still really important.

‚ÄúWomen are judged very harshly for showing anger ‚Äì we are told that it is invalid, irrational, that we sound hysterical or infantile ‚Äì or dangerous. .. It‚Äôs a fight and a balance between an unwillingness to hear women‚Äôs anger and women‚Äôs determination to voice it.‚Äù -@rtraister https://t.co/Kto8Kxp85A
‚ÄúIf you look at almost every movement that has transformed this country ... there are angry women at the start. Women‚Äôs anger is politically catalytic, and that‚Äôs something we need to recognize in this moment where so much of it is spilling over.‚Äù -@rtraister https://t.co/rGnx3DjsLC
Is it a movement or a moment? -@GayleKing  ‚ÄúWell, political and social movements are made up of strings of moments ‚Äì sometimes over decades, over centuries really. These are fights that have been going on for centuries.‚Äù -@RTraister https://t.co/xkZBZ9YNc6

"..we are innocent until proven guilty in this great country. And I have absolutely no doubt after reviewing Dr Ford‚Äôs testimony that she has suffered from something very traumatic in her lifetime.

‚ÄúThis is no ordinary inquiry. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre calling it ‚Äì it‚Äôs essentially a background check. .. Agents are talking to people at the core of the allegations and then working their way out to try to corroborate the information.‚Äù -@jeffpeguescbs https://t.co/j98I2UJVJa

Author Michael Lewis on the Trump administration transition team: "Chris Christie had built multi-hundred person team to go in the day after the election filled with actually qualified people to do it, and Trump fired the entire team the day after the election." https://t.co/vZfEtY4OZ8
What is Mueller zeroing in on? -@NorahODonnell  "The many indictments that we‚Äôve seen so far give us a lot of clues. Obviously he‚Äôs very very focused on the obstruction front. And his interest in these figures around Trump..are ways to get at that question" -@gregpmiller https://t.co/x9yxbH6kma
Does Bob Mueller have the president‚Äôs tax returns? -@jdickerson  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a huge question. I imagine he does, we don‚Äôt know for sure. But he can get tax returns pretty easily. I think he has a lot more than tax returns.‚Äù -@gregpmiller https://t.co/mbODPVIF65

‚ÄúWhat we were able to do in that elevator was establish human connection. I connected to him because he is a father, I am a mother.

"We just heard a woman..pour out her heart &amp; expose herself to so may attacks to protect our country. She‚Äôs telling her story to protect our country. I stood in front of his office and told my story to protect my children and the country they are growing up in" -@AnaMariaArchil2 https://t.co/LzKqdlEeic
When the elevator door closed, did you think history might change? -@NorahODonnell  ‚ÄúI did not think that. I thought that the interaction that we had just had had touched him and that it had connected with a seed of perhaps doubt and a sense of responsibility‚Äù - @AnaMariaArchil2 https://t.co/5LkMQzLwXp
What's the potential impact of the delayed confirmation? -@NorahODonnell  ‚ÄúIt means that they could tie if the cases are really contentious ..it‚Äôs less likely we‚Äôre going to have a 4-4 tie in some of these early on cases. As the term goes on, that could well happen.‚Äù -@JanCBS https://t.co/IK9C0qT40x
Coming up on @CBSThisMorning - we‚Äôre joined by one of the women who confronted Sen. @JeffFlake in an elevator on Friday. @AnaMariaArchil2 tells us what led her to confront the Senator, and what impact her words had on the #Kavanaugh nomination https://t.co/A1UKGtvK6J
Dr. Ford on why witnesses Leland Keyser and PJ Smyth don't remember the party: ‚ÄúNothing remarkable happened to them that evening‚Äù
.@maziehirono tells Dr. Ford: "By coming forward, you have inserted the question of character into this nomination, and hopefully back into American life."
"Dr. Ford has not been on trial this morning. But Judge Kavanaugh will be on trial this afternoon. They are going to grill him. ... They‚Äôre going to test him." -@NorahODonnell on what to expect from #Kavanaugh's testimony this afternoon https://t.co/jRjxHpO4rs
We‚Äôre live on @CBSNews with analysis and further reporting during the break in Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee https://t.co/QOcwngMpcP
Dr. Ford says "certainly nothing as striking as that event" (the assault) would have contributed to her PTSD and anxiety
Dr. Ford says she is not certain whether the Washington Post reporters actually saw the records from her marriage therapy
.@nancycordes: "What we're watching for is do 2 Republicans out of the 51 Republicans in the Senate believe her story, and believe that this is disqualifying. Because if they do and they say they're going to vote no- and assuming all Democrats vote no - he doesn't have the votes"
Dr. Ford on her strongest memory of the assault: "Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter. The uproarious laughter between the two. And their having fun at my expense."
So this could not be a case of mistaken identity? -@SenFeinstein   ‚ÄúAbsolutely not.‚Äù ‚Äì Dr. Ford
Dr. Ford testifies that she has suffered "claustrophobia and panic" as a result of the assault #Kavanaugh
Dr. Ford to Sen. Feinstein: "I haven‚Äôt held it in all these years, I did disclose it in the confines of therapy."
Prosecutor Rachel Mitchell in response to Dr. Ford's statement that she is terrified: "I just wanted to let you know, I‚Äôm very sorry. That‚Äôs not right."
Dr. Ford: "I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives. Those who say that do not know me. I am a fiercely independent person and I am no one‚Äôs pawn."
Dr. Ford: "At the same time, my greatest fears have been realized ‚Äì &amp; the reality has been far worse than what I expected. ... I have been called the most vile and hateful names imaginable. These messages .. .have rocked me to my core"
Dr. Ford: " In a letter on August 31, 2018, Senator Feinstein wrote that she would not share the letter without my consent. I greatly appreciated this commitment. All sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves whether their private experience is made public."
Dr. Ford: "I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh‚Äôs conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault."
Dr. Ford: "Brett‚Äôs assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details. I did not want to tell my parents that I, at age 15, was in a house without any parents present, drinking beer with boys."
Dr. Ford: "I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life."
Dr. Ford: "I don‚Äôt have all the answers, and I don‚Äôt remember as much as I would like to. But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult."
Dr. Ford: "I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett #Kavanaugh and I were in high school.‚Äù
Sen. Feinstein: "This is not a trial for Dr. Ford. This is a job interview for Brett Kavanaugh."
Sen. Feinstein: "What I find most inexcusable is this rush to judgment. The unwillingness to take these kinds of allegations at face value and look at them for what they are ‚Äì a real question of character for someone who is asking for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court"
Senator Feinstein on the letter from Dr. Ford: "She asked me to hold it confidential, and I held it confidential up to a point where the witness was willing to come forward."
Grassley: "I can think of no one better equipped to question the witnesses than Rachel Mitchell." #Kavanaugh
Senator Grassley: "The FBI provided us with the allegations. Now it‚Äôs up to the Senate to assess their credibility." #Kavanaugh
‚ÄúWe live in a country where you‚Äôre presumed innocent and you have to corroborate accusations of felonies..It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like Dr. Ford, it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt understand that women are being abused..But sometimes people are accused of things they didn‚Äôt do‚Äù-@LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/3Esbv2hz0f
.@LindseyGrahamSC on the two men who have come forward claiming they may have been the man who assaulted Ford: ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs crazy as a loon, I don‚Äôt believe the other one. I‚Äôm not going to play this game.‚Äù https://t.co/zxxg5dbXP4
Why don‚Äôt you believe Dr. Ford? -@NorahODonnell  ‚ÄúI am a lawyer. I‚Äôm not going to assume that he‚Äôs guilty if you can‚Äôt tell me the year, the month, the place‚Ä¶what am I supposed to do? Abandon every concept we hold dear in our legal system to get an outcome?‚Äù -@LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/2K3yqTCVMi
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre expecting me to go ahead and ignore the fact that she cannot tell me when it happened, where it happened ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm supposed to go ahead and ruin this guy‚Äôs life, when all the evidence suggests he‚Äôs not that way? I will not do that.‚Äù -@LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/NjuXBxvV5J

"Really all memory .. are fragments, pieces we remember and then we kind of turn it into a narrative afterwards. Sometimes that narrative can have inaccuracies ‚Ä¶ but usually the elements of it are the memories we use to structure that memory." -Dr. Ted Huey https://t.co/IyXAW55F2W
How reliable is the memory decades later? -@NorahODonnell  ‚ÄúWhat the research shows is that it matters kind of what you‚Äôre talking about. So the more peripheral memories might be mis-remembered as the decades go on, but usually the core is remembered pretty well." -Dr. Ted Huey https://t.co/WBIjsM67N9

How unusual is it for a nominee to do an interview like this? -@NorahODonnell ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never happened before that anyone can remember.

I take it back to the Anita Hill example..where Pres. HW Bush did reopen the investigation based on her allegations, and look how those 302s were used. It was a brutal, brutal cross-examination of her in public. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs a model we really want to follow. -@FranTownsend https://t.co/gyAblmUT8B
You're saying an FBI investigation might not help Dr Ford? -@GayleKing  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly right..she through her lawyers has asked for this FBI investigation, and I think it makes her look political. This is very difficult..but I think she ought to tell her story‚Äù -@FranTownsend https://t.co/D5fBGAedJo
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to come down to credibility. And so in the end the Judiciary Committee ‚Äì and if the hearing is public, the American people ‚Äì are going to be the judges of this.
