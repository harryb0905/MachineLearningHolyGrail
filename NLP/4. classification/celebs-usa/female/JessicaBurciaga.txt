@RealKyleMorris If he can go on national tv and call them "Sons of bitches" then what better way to show him his behavior is not accepted.
@RealKyleMorris Because what better way 2 get your point across then to do it w/ millions watching. Just like Trump gets 2 do everyday 2 spread his message
@nickharpel He wasn't outraged when nazis were beating up blacks or Puerto Rico being destroyed. But a NFL player exercising his rights he's so outraged
@nickharpel Why doesn't he talk about the real problems that have affected thousands of ppl around the world? The NBA seems to be at the top of his list
@Reese_Cup_xo lol haven't seen him address it yet! But the NBA seems to be at the top of the list 👍🏽

@MattP509 @heyyitzzcindyy I could give a shit lol
@heyyitzzcindyy But there's a difference. I don't know about you but I don't want to be the big protector over my man, I want him to protect me
@heyyitzzcindyy If I have a husband he naturally takes on the masculine role and protects our family. Yes he can be nurturing and women can be strong
@SouthwestAir I would love to show u receipts but how about u show your camera records to see who stole my stuff so I don't have to do all this extra work
@SouthwestAir No you don't, you're employees just steal them and make your customers go through all this bullshit to get out stuff back!
@SouthwestAir since "you can't" figure out how it happened or who took my bag. Maybe I can help you with that or the police
@SouthwestAir if this isn't resolved asap I will open up my own investigation on you and the send the police to take a look at your cameras
@SouthwestAir I feel like you owe me for my bag and the cost of everything in there PLUS extra for all this bullshit you guys put me through
@SouthwestAir of my bank statements &amp; years of buying my stuff that was in that bag. Plus a lot were gifts from my BF, including my luggage
@SouthwestAir and figure out which employees are stealing from us! This is such an inconvenience and I shouldn't have to go back years
@SouthwestAir I had close to 14k of belongings in my bag and now you send me an email asking for receipts. Why don't you check your cameras
@SouthwestAir so it takes you a month to respond to my claim since my bag was stolen on my flight. You still haven't found my bag

@__JayLondon The streets here are wider and bigger but because so many ppl are moving here it's becoming like NY I meant, like you can barely move
@__JayLondon The traffic is 100x worse in New York, I didn't say anything about how many ppl lived here, the streets are bigger in LA
Driving in LA is becoming unbearable, in a couple years it's going to be just like New York 😖
Please come! It's for a great cause. Hope to see you all there ❤️🎅🏽
I will be there to personally collect the toys and bring to the Children of the Mission in LA who have been victimized by domestic violence

@SteveHirmiz @SheanLV I was expressing my thoughts about trump, just cus we have different views about him doesn't mean talk down to me
Guess I'll change my avi too 🤗
@emilysears @SteveHirmiz he changed it 3 times lol
@SteveHirmiz you said i was disrespectful first but you called me eye candy and said I was going to get deported so how am I wrong?
@JH_3034 and the bio 😂
@SteveHirmiz ignorant ppl like u is a key factor of why women are being held back in society 2day and races are divided and a factor in 2016

@RudyBetto no he cares about the power
@RichardLoria same sex marriage, Obamacare, prosecuting Hillary, abortion ..
Trump got a lot of votes for the stuff he said he wanted to change now he's like ehhh it's already legal so I'm just gonna leave it lol
Soo @realDonaldTrump can't even get his own name on twitter but he's gonna build a wall, ok! 😂
Retracting almost everything he said during his campaign, you're a joke
Watching the 60 mins interview &amp; @realDonaldTrump is a real life idiot. All excited about 100k followers on IG, ur the president elect dummy

2016 has been a hell of a year
Can't wait to see everyone he blames this year for his own actions
Trump is so annoying, saying the protesting is unfair and caused by the media.. ok just like the election was rigged too right? Shut up ✋🏽
@Frank6745 most protesters walking are doing so to bring ppl together of all races to show love and fighting against the racism trump showed
@Frank6745 I'm sure trump will be your saving grace 👌🏽he seems to care so much about minorities
@Frank6745 maybe you should check your facts, she's winning the popular vote by over 219,000, any news channel or internet should help you

As if I'm the only person who doesn't like trump. Lol press the unfollow button guys it's there for a reason, I promise I'll be ok 🍷
The minute you speak your mind about something they always have to say "stick to naked photos" "stick to showing your ass"
Guys who follow pretty girls, models etc get so mad when the girls actually tweet about something else other than bikini photos
@1Kive and so does trump, he can't even debate and talk without insulting someone, you can always press the unfollow button buddy
@janthony6 but he only blames Mexicans and wants to build a wall to prevent rape, he should start in America
Trump does know that white men rape women too and commit crimes too right? He always has to label minorities as the trouble makers
"I respect his children" lmaooo she couldn't even name anything she liked about him.
I'll just have a glass of wine tho lol
That debate made me wanna smoke a cigarette
I'm still waiting to hear Donald Trumps plan, he hasn't answered 1 question lol 🍿
@JH_3034 ridiculous like I can't even believe what I'm watching
Trump cant even keep his cool and handle talking to a women, how is he going to deal w big presidential problems, he looks weak
Like dude just answer the damn question and stop pointing the finger like a child. She's keeping her cool, gotta give her that. He's a child
Everytime Anderson asks Trump something his response is always "But this person did it too, but Hilary did.. Hilary said this &amp; that
Lmaoooo! https://t.co/jroSTaf1aC
@janthony6 Monica was consensual, everyone knows that, it was an affair, not rape
How much money do you think Trump paid these women to say they were raped by Bill? 🙄
I'm not crazy about either of them but damn he's just all bad and so immature. Get him outta here ..
But he always stoops too low and is just mean.. he's not professional, not pleasant to listen to, just degrades everyone https://t.co/jNSChjiBm6
Donald trump is a piece of shit, I don't know how Hilary isn't kicking him in his throat right now .. he never talks about the topic at hand

Man .. eat the cereal life is short, just go jogging later today, jogging is good for you &amp; makes you feel good anyway ..5:47am thoughts lol
But maybe every generation feels this way, that's why your parents &amp; grandparents are always telling you to "enjoy it while you're young"
In my feelings at 5:39am lol 😓
We don't have a lot of time
Who misses the simple way we grew up.. Maybe that's why time seemed to move slower .. Everything is so fast now, I need it to slow down ..
Twitter, Snap chat, Instagram, Facebook, like how many apps do we need to post about our life .. Kinda cool , kinda not

@CEO how's Narcos? I'm going to start that show today since I'm not doing 💩 for Labor Day
@CEO I'm obsessed with the toothless kid 😂 he's so cute. It's about MKUltra mind control but it has a funny humor to it, kept me interested👻
@CEO I actually really liked it, maybe because it takes place in the 80's, reminded me of ET/ Poltergeist/ stuff I grew up on, it's sci-fi,
@EliWehbe I have to still watch Narcos, I'm late on that but heard how good it was.
@AC_Slater24 yea I wanted to just shake her a few times like talk already 😩
@AC_Slater24 I think I got her figured out 👀

He really tries to take my phone from me every time he see's someone got under my skin 😂 like Jess babe stop who cares ignore them

The coyotes don't scare me very much, as long as my dogs are inside the house
In some strange way I don't mind it lol having wine outside while the fire pit is lit, enjoying the slight breeze, talking to my neighbors
Neighborhood blackout for hours already.. Sitting outside w the candles going, hearing coyotes, kinda creepy 😕
Temperature can't be over 70 or I can't sleep
A nice little nap in my cold room w cold sheets w the air on 69 degrees while its 90 outside is about to feel so good 🤗😴
Snap chat you're doin too much w the save video/pic section 🙄
@AC_Slater24 I'll probably watch because I love to hear her talk w her Philly accent 😁
@MattP509 no that's where you're wrong, they've already came out and said he wasn't armed... Why don't you stick to fishing and shut up
@imayn3vafiiind I still don't see why they killed him when he was on the ground w 2 officers on top of him, unarmed
@DaveWCrabtree so a man laying on the ground unarmed is the enemy? He's not a fucken terrorist that you take out
@MrSzuch obviously if someone broke into my house to hurt me I would shoot if I had a gun but that man wasn't trying to hurt the officers
@MrSzuch the man in the video was laying on the ground and I'm talking about police violence not what I would do if a man broke into my home
@MrKyBB 🤔 yea clearly.. I've seen the video footage .. Man pinned on the ground w both hands on his sides gets shot in the chest and dies
@MrKyBB if you read all my tweets you would have seen I said that too
@olytrojan I didn't say shot if you read my entire tweet I said no one deserves to be shot and killed by a cop in that situation
@olytrojan yea if some1 breaks in my house and tries to hurt me but 2 trained cops pinning a man on the ground, they didn't need to kill him
@perumike a man is not much of a threat when 2 cops have him pinned down to the ground.. Just my opinion tho
@alfrnzo but kill the man that 2 cops are pinning down? Hmmm they are police officers they are trained to deal w these situations
@olytrojan and killed too? In these videos you've seen do these cops look like their life was in danger? They had him pinned down
Why shoot these men directly in their chest and head and end their life??! Ugh makes me so angry
Why not taser first? If a man is a threat or is resisting arrest or might have a gun on him, why not shoot him in the arm, leg?
Even if a man is resisting arrest, even if he's fighting you, even if you feel scared as a cop, no one deserves to be shot and killed
@Luther4212 so just because blacks kill eachother that makes it ok for police officers to kill them and it not matter?
https://t.co/8aJDXXMA0h
@djbrees just heard that too lol
Half these ppl don't care about you anyway, they just like to argue w you, judge you... But thanks to my nice followers you're appreciated 😘
I have a love/ hate relationship w social media, when I'm on it I'm good, when I'm gone for days I'm even better
@Luther4212 ppl kill eachother everyday but some police officers don't know how to reprimand and do their job w/o killing
It's just so sad, what can we do besides hashtag black lives matter, how do you stop or help any of this? Just talk on social media? wwjd ❤️
There's good ppl and bad ppl , there's good cops and there's bad cops, no one deserves to be shot and killed, they all have wives, children
Cool.. I'll lose followers by speaking my mind .. Byeeee 👋🏽✋🏽👋🏽✋🏽👋🏽✋🏽
@Lydiiakong idk 🤔
But black lives matter too and obviously things haven't changed so try to sympathize to what's going on in the world, it's just not right
White ppl arguing in comments about how their life matters too like yes we know your life matters we've known for hundreds of years ..
If I hear All lives matter one more time .. Like yes.. we all know All of our lives matter but open your eyes to what's happening
When you can't even find the right words to say because some ppl just don't get it ..

@Vincezli going thru highs &amp; lows are normal but having ur child killed Infront of you? No one needs to go thru that to know happiness
@djsourmilk it really is, can't stop thinking about it
@tweetemilysears worst nightmare
Being happy in this life is temporary, it can all change tomorrow, try to enjoy every moment and cherish your family &amp; friends.. Oh &amp; pray❤️
You can be happy w your own life &amp; how blessed you are but you can't really feel TRUE joy knowing how many other ppl are suffering right now
This has been a hell of a 2016 year.. I'm ready for 2017 already .. Too much sadness.
How do you get over that scene in your mind as a parent? How do you go on w life... Ugh I can't even imagine how they feel... makes me cry
Seriously can't stop thinking of that little boy who got taken under water by an alligator infront of the parents 😔💔

@wakeuplaura_ go into a movie theater or mall bathroom at night by urself and run into a group of guys in there and see if you feel the same
@Buddha_Dan @Austin_Brink if we r going 2 cater 2 every1 that's unhappy in the world w small issues like that than where do we draw the line
I'm always up so late when I know I have to be up early 🌙 okie goodnight 😘🏳
@ESPeNa88 I get it and ladies all go to the bathroom to get away for a sec and have girl talk and guys need their time in there too 🚽🌚
@misslindsaykaep yes I think so too, doesn't the world have bigger issues than this? 🕵🏼😩
I don't mind a trans woman using the female bathroom, I'm fine w that, I just don't want straight men in there lol https://t.co/AQtkTaJmBI
@thundercupLA love her! 😩😂
@HoviBryant in a club atmosphere I get it I guess but if I'm at a mall and I walk in alone and there's 4 men in there I'm a little uneasy
@HoviBryant yea well i still don't like it, it's kinda weird and I want my privacy as a woman. Problems or not I'm sure most don't prefer it
😂 and women don't wanna take one w their man in the next stall either or any other man https://t.co/230w6aIYi7
@xxSolisOwnsUxx view on the topic now we are bashing, racist or insensitive. They have their opinion, we have ours but why is theirs right?🤔
@xxSolisOwnsUxx Thank u. I just don't like that ppl who always want equal for everything get praised but if someone has a more conservative
@nihir I think that's fine if they identify as a woman and use the female bathroom, that wouldn't scare me
@nihir maybe in certain areas w a high gay population but not at schools, I don't agree w that
@nihir so use our tax payers money to build bathrooms everywhere so everyone feels equal? What next? Theres more important issues
😂😂😂 okkkkk https://t.co/nXoGvnSmba
@nihir funny thing is no one would use those M/F bathrooms if they were in public places, women want privacy
I don't have time to think about my faith in random men when I just want to use the bathroom at a baseball game 🙄 https://t.co/S6BoKZndrf
Everything offends everyone these days I'm so over it, like can I have my opinion anymore w/o ppl protesting 🏴 https://t.co/n7samcSvXM
@nihir I think if they look like a woman they should just go into the woman's bathroom and use it, none of us would question them
@nihir but what about how the majority ppl feel? Most high school kids don't agree but the 2 transgender kids in the school get their way?
@TheCoveted713 better yet if I had a teen daughter now I wouldn't want her to go into the bathroom by herself
But I can pick who I mate w, I don't want to be in the bathroom alone w a man I don't know who may be a creep https://t.co/ADTR5u5C5N
@DeRayDavis @tweetemilysears I just wanted to point out other labels besides milf and sexy teen lol .. Again.. not that I was searching 🕵🏽
It only makes certain ppl feel equal and they are not the majority sooo.. https://t.co/7KsF1bhxyz
@tweetemilysears I've seen many porn w the titles "hot sexy Latina gets it in the 🎂" 👀😂 not that I was searching or anything
I'm sure the men don't mind as much 🙃
That's actually creepy and I wouldn't feel safe and I'm sure most women wouldn't. Ladies you like this idea?

No offense to Ohio, I picked that place at random
Like I don't really care what Rick in Ohio thinks of my dog post 🤔
It would literally stop half the world from having a voice on social media lol
I wish Instagram had that feature like MySpace did, where you can disable all comments and just post what you want w/o hearing BS
@EliWehbe 😅 https://t.co/lZNFAs7scO

No makeup but a great filter! 👻 https://t.co/RAS9xoL7HR
Like just chill, it's not that serious.
Like who really has the time to judge a complete stranger like that. Everyone can't be perfect all the time or take the perfect photo
"Is 1 of her elbows more pointy than the other?" "What's wrong w her middle toe?" "Omg you're getting too skinny!" "Omg did she gain weight?
Oh and some of you followers/ fans are out of control too, causing women to overly think there photo before posting lol judgmental asses
Lol ok thanks, and this coming from a person that is clearly not happy w the way they look so they've literally transformed themselves 🙄
You know what's really annoying. Women that have had everything done tell girls on social media to be love themselves &amp; embrace their looks
Every girls body is starting to look the same to me on Instagram, huge boobs, no waist, fake butt &amp; hips. 🙄
Like when i was growing up women weren't shaped like I see now, 16 inch waist, huge plastic boobs w butt shots and fat transfer
And just because it's on a meme doesn't make it true lol
I like social media, there's good and bad that comes along w it, just try not to believe everything you see ladies
Too many ppl living for the gram and not their real life .. Anyway just wanted to say something about that 🤕
You know butt implants went up 98% last year because so many girls want to look perfect for social media, that's sick
Feel like they don't look good enough. I want you all to know, no one is perfect, those are expensive cameras, Photoshop &amp; FaceTune lol
Then you have regular girls &amp; women following you thinking how could anyone look this perfect.. and now these girls especially younger ones
I think ppl have become overly obsessed w themselves &amp; the way they look especially their body, girls don't even look real anymore on there
Like I get it, there's a ton of money involved and if you knew the numbers you wouldn't turn it down either but at the same time ..
@ItsDonBenjamin @JasminMedar I can't anymore like everyone is taking it way too serious lol
@JasminMedar lol I'm one of them but Def not the worst
Got sick of looking at myself and analyzing pics before posting them, it's so stupid https://t.co/MdagO1ctqM
Maybe I'll feel different next week lol.. It was nice giving that a break for awhile and looking at real life more
I kinda got over Instagram the past few months, like how many pics do you need to post of yourself a day 🤔
Just cus 🐶 https://t.co/VOsJhXAzoP
You know what ....... Lol nevermind 🙄🤐

@HeartBreak_Dre_ @EliWehbe well I like her, I think she's sexy 🤗
@HeartBreak_Dre_ hey the prettiest girls can take a bad pic so that's not that bad lol I've seen worse
@HeartBreak_Dre_ she is the baddest lol she doesn't even need a stylist, she walks around in a man's t-shirt and slippers and is 🔥
@RightUp_Maiale I really don't care lol
@tweetemilysears that way not just any troll could leave a mean comment for attention, they wouldn't even be seen unless we allowed it
@tweetemilysears I don't miss MySpace top 8 but it would be cool if we could disable all comments till approved like MySpace had 🤗
Is that a grown man wearing a dress in the new H&amp;M commercial dressed as a girl? 🤔 I seriously can't anymore ..
I guess if Riri was driving eating a burger next to me I would be one of those creeps 🙋🏽🍔🍟👀 #guilty

Like speed up and stop staring, I'm hungry here and now I'm too uncomfortable to put these fries in my mouth 😕
Ladies isn't it the most annoying thing when you're driving and the guy next to you keeps staring at you while ur trying to eat 🙄😩
@DJDRAMA remember how bad we wanted to post this pic back then? 😊💑

@Hambizel no I just never really liked it, only pepperoni on my pizza lol
Womp just realized how that sounded lol
I cook my dogs organic chicken tho, I won't take that away from them 🐶🐶❤️ I just don't think I want it in my mouth anymore
@CR_TheGreat right I agree lol 😷
@HNP1982 definitely, lol
@CR_TheGreat really? 🙈 I thought milk and eggs are ok if it's organic?
Im more of a seafood person anyway but once in awhile who doesn't crave a good Cheeseburger w fries 😩 and you gotta have meatballs w pasta
I just ordered all these meal preps from this company and got turkey meatballs and now I don't want them 😩
I don't eat pork at all but giving up turkey bacon, turkey pepperoni and chicken sausage would be hard for me, oh and meatballs 😑🍝
The animal cruelty videos are enough of a visual that will make you sick the next time a burger is in your face, I gotta stop watching 🙈😩
I'm not a huge meat eater but the little I've had lately is making me not want it at all anymore 😷

Like why do u have the time or interest to even argue w ppl u don't know about situations u know shit about 🙄 lame AF.. But ppl love blogs
I think it's funny when you see all the trolls in the comments start arguing w the other trolls on why they are right and the other is wrong
social media trolls that leave comments on situations they know nothing about is so annoying. They'll never know.. They can only speculate
You're damned if you do and damned if you don't, you seriously can't win. Either way ppl are gonna believe what they are gonna believe
Ppl can't even defend themselves without ppl thinking they must be guilty.. But then if you stay quiet they think you're guilty still.
