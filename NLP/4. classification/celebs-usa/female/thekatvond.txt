@logicalharmony I'm only gonna say it one last time: @KATVONDbeauty DOES NOT HAVE A PARENT COMPANY THAT TESTS ON ANIMALS. Please correct.
@logicalharmony @KATVONDbeauty you actually DO say it. And that is not accurate. https://t.co/tnjVB74fbZ
...in fact, @KATVONDbeauty's  partnership is with Kendo - a #crueltyfree brand production company.  @logicalharmony
Dear @logicalharmony, please update the misinformation on your site. @KATVONDbeauty doesn't have a parent company that test on animals.
