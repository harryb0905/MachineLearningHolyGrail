.@SJakesRoberts has taught me so much about the word of God and through her ministry, I have strengthened my relationship with God.
.@rihanna taught me to embrace the skin I am in. RiRi is such a boss and she exudes enviable confidence. Her confidence and drive to empower women of all shapes, shades, and sizes is so inspiring.
.@serenawilliams taught me the power of compassionate anger. I have struggled with controlling my anger in fear of being labeled an "angry Black woman" when in actuality, I have hella reasons to be angry. She showed me it's okay to be real.
.@janetmock taught us use your own experiences to create authenticity in your work. Janet is the 1st trans woman of color hired as a writer of a television show. Through her position as a writer, director, &amp; producer for the show, she has brought her life experiences to FX's Pose
.@staceyabrams  taught us DO NOT CONCEDE. Before the obstacle presents itself, choose to never give up by fighting until the very end. There's something remarkably beautiful about appreciating the opposition and maintaining humility no matter the outcome.
.@iamcardib taught us three things ... 1. Stay humble but remain hungry 2. Don't let society define who you are 3. Switch it up on 'em and show them that you cannot be defined
The 'Black Panther' cast .@ImAngelaBassett .@Lupita_Nyongo .@DanaiGurira .@letitiawright taught me there is power when women unite. The film highlighted what it means to be a powerful Black woman and how important it is to have a tribe supporting you.
.@ava taught me it's great to learn and know what you DON'T want. This amazing filmmaker didn't pick up a camera until she was 32, after realizing journalism wasn't for her.  It's valuable to have those early experiences to learn what you don't want.
.@itsgabrielleu  taught me to reclaim my self-worth because I am worthy and I bring an extreme value to the table. There's no need to compete with others because my only competition is with who I was yesterday.
.@jadapsmith has taught me SO much. Recently, I watched the episode on forgiveness and when she talked about gaining emotional independence, I started crying like a baby. I am guilty of giving others the power to make me happy or sad and I now know that I hold that power.
.@WuzzamSupa taught us there's no truth to the term "over-saturated market." If God says it's for you, there ain't a devil in hell that can stop it from coming into fruition.
#MeghanMarkle taught me my fairy tale is possible; I create the story. Meghan's marriage to Prince Harry transcended all lines ‚Äì race, nationality, and tradition.
