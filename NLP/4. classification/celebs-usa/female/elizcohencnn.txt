Nurse forced to isolate @ hospital cuz 1 hi temp w/forehead scan, which several studies show isn't so reliable. She's fever &amp; Ebola free.

Nurse Kaci Hickox risked her life to save Ebola patients and returns to New Jersey to be treated like a criminal. http://t.co/BfFqlCrcYl
How will this quarantine work? Who drives them from airport to home? Where will family members  live? What if worker lives out of state?
Remember - these asymptomatic drs and nurses can't spread Ebola.
NY &amp; NJ mandate quarantine for anyone with direct contact w/ Ebola patients. Will drs and nurses still want to take care of these patients?
See my tweet 12:12am. Now NJ is quarantining healthcare worker returning from W Africa *who has no symptoms.* Will drs still want to help?
At Bellevue Hospital getting ready for update on Ebola patient Dr. Craig Spencer. Is he getting experimental drug? Plasma transfusion?

@theNPSF @MarkRaganCEO I totally get it. Even empowered people feel uncomfortable asking to wash hands. #patientchat
@USNewsHealth I've seen drs/nurses put on new gloves without washing hands. Not good enough! Just means dirty gloves!  #patientchat
#patientchat @HeartSisters @USNewsHealth Yes but happens way too often so we need to know it and come up with strategies for asking.
@USNewsHealth Hospitals hate high readmission rates. Say: "would be terrible if I had to come right back here." #patientchat
Be blunt and specific: I dont feel ready because _ and I'd hate for something bad to happen when I go home. #patientchat @USNewsHealth
@USNewsHealth Ask dr/nurse to double check: "I would hate for there to be a mistake &amp; u might be blamed." #patientchat
@USNewsHealth Be blunt:"I dont think I'm supposed to have this procedure &amp; would hate for you to get in trouble for doing it." #patientchat
@USNewsHealth I riff on this in my book "The Empowered Patient" remember gloves don't = clean! #patientchat
#patientchat @USNewsHealth I put it on me:"Dr, I'm a germophobe like Howie Mandel. Sounds crazy, but I'd like to see you wash ur hands."
@USNewsHealth Be blunt:"I know you're in a rush but I don't understand what ur telling me. I dont want anything bad to happen." #patientchat
t4 @USNewsHealth Say: "I don't understand what I'm supposed to do &amp; would hate for something bad to happen when I get home." #patientchat
Fire your dr if s/he resents you doing your own research. That's a deal breaker. #patientchat
This mom "fired" dr and had her baby at home. Controversial, to say the least - it was a vbac! http://t.co/SLZCNe6ykh #patientchat

For more on patients helping other patients, see http://t.co/Wz17d3QqrL #patientchat
T3 Before u leave appt, ask when you should start feeling better. If you don't by that time, time to call the dr back.  #patientchat
T2 If important appt, bring someone with you. Hard to ask good questions when stressed out.  #patientchat
@USNewsHealth Make list of questions beforehand. Before appt ends, make sure you understand diagnosis and next steps.  #patientchat
And I never use paper! Because I will lose it! #patientchat
@USNewsHealth I'm old fashioned - I use the yellow Notes in my Iphone. Very searchable.  #patientchat
@h1choksi A good dr will be happy you're educated, and will point out bad info.  #patientchat
@StevenSternberg @TamiLB @dailyRx @3Lehman Look for patients  with same illness. See what's recommended by several of them. #patientchat
@TrishaTorrey Excellent point! Read thru info and make bullet points to discuss with dr. #patientchat
@TamiLB @dailyRx @3Lehman Patients learn so much for one another. Talk to someone who's been where you are now!  #patientchat
@MedSavingsDoc @TrishaTorrey 2 of my fave sites: http://t.co/iY6VRH1REm and medlineplus.  #patientchat
@RWJF_HumanCap @USNewsHealth My book,  The Empowered Patient" has advice on how to get best info, ask best questions. #patientchat
@3Lehman @nyphospital Plus, being an educated patient means you can ask better questions.  #patientchat
@3Lehman @nyphospital I've found that patients are usually very thoughtful and can understand what they're reading.  #patientchat
@USNewsHealth you'll find out there might be approaches other than what your dr has recommended. #patientchat
@USNewsHealth Pros - you'll find out there might be other approaches than what your dr has recommended. Con - avoid dumb websites.
@USNewsHealth It's more than OK - it's really important to do  your own research. #patientchat

@farragounveiled MT @preeclampsia To see tweets from today's chat, search "#PreAM13" on Twitter and RT content
@aliciacollin Now they're burning! That's great. Had such a wonderful time with your group last year.
#PreAM13 @Preeclampsia @Eleni_Z_Tsigas @DeborahEBush My pleasure. This is so important. Thanks for all the great questions.
#PreAM13 @Preeclampsia Right. Don't assume ER has called ur provider.
#PreAM13 @eleni_z_tsigas @Preeclampsia Writing book taught me to trust instincts. If you feel "off" go to dr dont assume normal part of preg
#PreAM13 @RobinPregnancy So true! I missed my build up - went up three clothing sizes in 2 wks. That should have tipped me off.
#PreAM13 @DeborahEBush Be explicit about what you're feeling. Say "I have x,y,z - I'm concerned I might have preeclampsia."
#PreAM13 @DeborahEBush If you know in advance you might have to deliver early find hospital with great NICU.
#PreAM13 @Preeclampsia @RobinPregnancy Hospitals have advocates/ombudsmen. Use them in nec. Pick up house phone and ask for them.
#PreAM13 @DeborahEBush Be vigilant while on magsulfate. That stuff is nec but toxic. Make sure they get blood levels, check reflexes etc
#PreAM13 @Preeclampsia That's true for many women inc me. So important for loved one to be there all the time and fight for you if nec.
#PreAM13 @DeborahEBush We got magsulfate test results late in hospital. My wonderful husband had to beg&amp;plead to find out. He saved mylife.
#PreAM13 @Preeclampsia If provider sez there's protein in pee ask how much A little bit? Astronomic?  in btwn? Get # and what it means.
#PreAM13 @Preeclampsia Know what's "off" for you. If you feel funky, speak up! Don't just attribute it to being pregnant.
#PreAM13 @DeborahEBush Yes! If your provider isn't answering your questions, returning your calls etc go find someone else.
#PreAM13 @Preeclampsia Mention everything, even if seems trivial. It might actually be important.
#PreAM13 @Preeclampsia Before each appt, write down your questions. Even the smartest patients go blank inside exam room.
@hcathy @Preeclampsia @LamazeOnline #PreAM13 Great idea. Or write it in notes section of your smart phone.
#PreAM13 @RobinPregnancy @childbirth I write about this in my book. Being a "bad" patient can save your life! Ask, ask, ask!
#PreAM13 @Preeclampsia I had flulike symptoms and stiff neck. Didn't go to dr! Not smart. Now I tell women if you feel sick, go to dr.
#PreAM13 @RobinPregnancy @hcathy Exactly. Know ur BP early in preg so you'll recognize an increase. My dr caught it but I hear others dnt.
#PreAm13 @hcathy @Preeclampsia Oy. A *change* in BP is important, even if you are &lt;140. That's what happened to me.
@RobinPregnancy #PreAM13 that is so true. dr/midwife is used to questions! They'd rather have questions than a sick mom.
@jbcarney @hcathy @Preeclampsia The message: know the signs and get to dr/midwife immediately.
#PreAM @CorinaMesenger @Preeclampsia Science on preg timing is kind of fuzzy. Use the time between preg to check for underlying conditions.
#PreAM13 @hcathy @Preeclampsia Cathy - wow, you're a true survivor. So glad everything went well.
T1 @Preeclampsia Be an empowered patient and know the signs of PE.  I had signs and missed them. #PreAM13
#PreAM13 @Vera9940crc @Preeclampsia Great discussion to have with your dr. Many women including me go on to have healthy pregnancies afer PE
I've written about it and I've lived it: join me for chat at 1p ET with @Preeclampsia Send us your questions #PreAM13.
@preeclampsia Looking forward to Twitter chat at noon ET - send me your questions. Dont want others to suffer like I did. #PreAM13
