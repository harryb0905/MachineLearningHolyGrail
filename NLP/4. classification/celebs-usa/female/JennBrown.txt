Need a good TV series to start?!?! Got any recommendations?
@digitalbump not in support of vigilante justice, just disturbed that this is an article @NBCNews would publish. Especially considering this is the exact premise of @NBC Dateline “To Catch a Predator.”  Not really different and actually worse IMHO
You forgot to add, “was on his way to have sex with a child.” SMH  RT @BrandyZadrozny: In October, a popular Connecticut outfit called POPSquad, recorded a "bust" of 20-year-old Alain Malcolm. Malcolm, was black, Jamaican, a Jehovah’s Witness and gay. By morning, he was dead.
@billytyra fixed, thanks
I just read an article from @NBCNews by @BrandyZadrozny, and is it just me, or is the tone of this article that we should feel bad for pedophiles that are being outed in sting operations? What am I missing? Adults having sex with children is bad.  https://t.co/b65MWmRMgq
Why use quotes for “child predators” in your reporting? A 20 year old meeting a 14 year old to have sex...is that not a child predator? https://t.co/wcKSecS0at
