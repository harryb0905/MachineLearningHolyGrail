Happy 4th birthday, Mighty Quinn. ‚ô•Ô∏è https://t.co/MNfR36lx4G
What a game!!! Said nobody ever. But a big congrats to the @Patriots (and all their fans). And now it‚Äôs bedtime. See you in the early am on @FTFonFS1
I live with a diehard @Patriots fan. You can only imagine the ongoing commentary from @stephgosk with just over 2 minutes to play. The pacing, the jumping, the play calling, yelling at refs, advising Belichek, checking Twitter, mumbling about yardage.. üò≥
Thanks for spending time with us on @FTFonFS1 today @dmorey, you‚Äôre now officially my 2nd favorite NBA GM.   Now if you can just get my guy, @danielrainge to come hang with us... https://t.co/UmVU1nrvXO
Me: Clears throat  Literally everyone: Are you sick?!?!?!?
Happy holidays... from our beautiful Xmas morning mess to yours. @stephgosk https://t.co/wULYrbE5CB
My 5-yr old: Mommy, will Santa be in camouflage tonight? Me: Why would he be in camouflage?? 5-yr old: So he doesn‚Äôt have to sign autographs. There‚Äôs just no time for that.
Watching Love Actually with the girls because... well because that‚Äôs what you do with the greatest Xmas movie of all time... you pass on your obsession. Aaaaaand they‚Äôre already over it.
My 3-yr old woke me up at 2am last night to ask what my favorite activity is. I said ‚Äòworking out‚Äô. She said, mine is gymnastics. I said, that‚Äôs a good activity. And then she went back to bed. Did she need reinforcement? üò≥
The worm. One of my many rare talents. Any other requests??? firstthingsfirstonfs1 https://t.co/0W9OqN5nBz
Wouldn‚Äôt be half as cool as I am without you in my life, D. (Don‚Äôt say it) https://t.co/0JfnnCNS5r

In case you‚Äôre wondering whether it‚Äôs easy for me to watch college football https://t.co/UsQaAMoPY2
My 3-yr old just told my 5-yr old she better ‚Äúwatch out because you‚Äôre in thin ice!!‚Äù
Just so I‚Äôm clear... are these the same @Patriots who have no offensive weapons? Asking for a friend.
Welcome back, Ryan Fitzpatrick üò≥
In other news... i just found out the fancy face cleanser I‚Äôve been using for the last few months is actually shampoo. So there‚Äôs that. #smallfont
My Coney Island takeaways: 1. Nobody heard of the movie, BIG.  2. My former stomach of steel now gets nauseous after half a ride on the kiddie coaster. 3. A seagull will eat literally anything. Including organic, nitrate free chicken jerky that this jerky decided to bring.
Mental note: ‚ÄúWe should take the kids to Coney Island for a few hours today‚Äù isn‚Äôt nearly as effortless as the suggestion seemed this morning. Two hours and 5000 ‚ÄòARE WE THERE YET‚Äôs  later... still in traffic.
Let‚Äôs go @serenawilliams ... little girls (and big girls, and mamas, and so many others) rooting for you today. #USOpen2018 https://t.co/dHj9GFdr7b

Memo to all the fake-sleepers on this Amtrak train hoping to deter me from sitting next to you... Nice try- Not only will I sit next to you, but I‚Äôm going to then tell you a long boring story about my kids. It‚Äôs gonna be amaaaaazing!!! üòú

As I was saying... Terry Rozier. @BostonCeltics And what a way to open up this series.
Wow. Did I speak too soon???
Terry Rozier. Enough said. @BostonCeltics
Driving through Times Square at 3am to get to work is like playing pole position while eating tacos and solving a math problem on a trampoline in a snowstorm. Wish I was kidding.

Say what you will about Tom Brady... love him or loathe him... he‚Äôs the GOAT.  #Patriots
And with that, I‚Äôd like to think that Case Keenum has FINALLY won the starting job!!! Can‚Äôt wait to chat this up with @getnickwright and @criscarter80
For a guy making his first playoff start, he looks so comfortable!! He may as well be throwing TD‚Äôs from his couch!! Go get‚Äôem, Case Keenum. #SaintsvsVikings
Tom Brady is gonna win a super bowl beating Marcus Mariota, Blake Bottles, and Case Keenum.
Tommy Bohanon.  Enough said.  #JAXvsPIT
Antonio Brown.   Enough said.
Obviously I‚Äôm concerned that @steelers coach Mike Tomlin isn‚Äôt wearing a coat. It‚Äôs 18 degrees Pittsburgh! Also I had the Steelers. But mostly the coat.
That time we all gathered at @criscarter80 ‚Äòs house for a night of nfl playoffs with steaks and stakes. @criscarter80 @getnickwright @stephgosk https://t.co/x9k1mNx310
That's the biggest missed throw of the game so far.If you hit that, you likely get points &amp; you guarantee ATL doesn't get points before half @getnickwright
Example 4,632 of replay making officiating/the game worse: 0% that is called a touchdown if refs aren't relying on replay as a crutch. @getnickwright

Harperisms from my 3-yr old @harperestelle:  Mom I'm so mad at you I'm only going to speak French! (Literally doesn't know a word of French)
I'm in a Via (like Uber pool) and my lovely driver just texted me that he's deaf and I've literally been talking to him for the last 5 min.
ME: Harper come give me a kiss HARPER: (age 3) I don't have time for kisses right now, mom  (Literally has no plans today and nothing to do)
Just saw @WonderWomanFilm ... Wow! I loved it!!! So so good! Two guesses what I'm going to be for Halloween this year. #muststarttraining

Thank you @cremescometrue and @Over40Style. #SheSparkChat has the best followers. I‚Äôve enjoyed tweeting with you!
@Over40Style Though reading that back, it doesn't seem nearly as scary as it was. #wuss? #shesparkchat
@Over40Style My Scariest Challenge: Underwater Mermaid Training. Breathing through a tiny tube in a tiny suit for an hour!  #SheSparkChat
@CremesComeTrue We build layers of fear, insecurities, stubbornness. People think it's just easier to live w/the extra weight #SheSparkChat
@CremesComeTrue When we‚Äôre young, change is easy. It‚Äôs fun &amp; approachable. As we get older, we become set in our ways. #SheSparkChat
@RMBnaturals @Over40Style If you change nothing, nothing changes. #shesparkchat
@kGm1970 For me, less is better. If you can get your nutrients from natural foods, that's best. Otherwise, I'd say a multi. #shesparkchat
@Over40Style I found that these small lifestyle changes CAN AND DO work for anyone, any age, any time. #SheSparkChat
@Over40Style My parents were NOT changing their health regimen. So I came up w/small changes they could make to their lives. #SheSparkChat
@Over40Style But they're also clueless when it comes 2 fitness/diet. How could such smart people make such bad health choices? #SheSparkChat
@Over40Style My mom was basically the reason I wrote the book. My parents are the most amazing people in the world.... #SheSparkChat
@CremesComeTrue Or I‚Äôll empty the dishwasher one item at a time by squatting down, or brush my teeth while doing a wall sit. #SheSparkChat
@CremesComeTrue Those days I‚Äôll walk an extra few blocks to take a different subway. #SheSparkChat.
@CremesComeTrue Absolutely! There are days when I‚Äôm stuck inside with the babies or I don‚Äôt have time to go to the gym. #SheSparkChat
@kGm1970 Don't like'em. Try to get used to drinking plain/bubbly water. If u need the sweet, try mint leaves, fresh fruit etc #shesparkchat
@rounditrosie Hard to get rid of completely but can definitely b reduced. Small clean meals, healthy lifestyle, stay active #shesparkchat
@ShellieBowdoin Unsweetened iced tea is great, but I'd rather you not rely on the fake sugars.
@Over40Style All the dips are used for dipping the veggies while I‚Äôm working in the kitchen. #SheSparkChat
@Over40Style Apples, hard boiled eggs, yogurt for making all kinds of dips like onion, veggie, basil, honey #SheSparkChat
@Over40Style Almond butter, string cheese, veggies, Wasa crackers, dark chocolate, cans of natural tuna, natural deli turkey #SheSparkChat
@GalleriadiGiani Aim for 10k steps/day. That's 4.5 miles. Once ur there, try 12k steps. Walking is great for u.. keep it up. #shesparkchat
@rounditrosie Slowly reduce them earlier and earlier every night. Start with no simple carbs after 6pm.  #shesparkchat
@Over40Style I love that! See if you can do it the rest of the night.
@Over40Style These two small changes help to keep you moving throughout the day. Not just the one hour you spend at the gym. #SheSparkChat
@Over40Style These ‚ÄòChanges‚Äô won‚Äôt make you dramatically lose weight, they are 1st STEPS toward LIFESTYLE CHANGES that WILL. #SheSparkChat
@CremesComeTrue You can even use your own body weight to replace weights! #SheSparkChat
@CremesComeTrue Muscle protects bones as you age. You won‚Äôt bulk up. You end up BURNING CALORIES ALL DAY LONG after lifting. #SheSparkChat
@Over40Style Finding time. NEVER ENOUGH IN THE DAY!! #shesparkchat
We experience natural muscle and bone loss as we get older. Resistance training helps build muscle. #SheSparkChat
Simple carbs spike sugar levels, have no real nutrients &amp; are empty calories. Complex carbs are high in nutrients &amp; fiber. #SheSparkChat
I like people to focus on COMPLEX CARBS while reducing their simple carb intake. #SheSparkChat
I never ask anyone to cut any food group out of their diets completely. Carbs aren‚Äôt bad for you, they provide energy. #SheSparkChat
@RMBnaturals @Over40Style Start small, like drinking water or walking 10k steps/day. Get that down and the rest will come. #shesparkchat
