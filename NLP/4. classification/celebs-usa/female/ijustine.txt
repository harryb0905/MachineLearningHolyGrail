@grantfriedman @SonyAlpha I’m not sure, I do prefer the flip up if I’m not using a microphone. Less obvious if you glance up at the screen. Although, side flip is the best way to go for using a mic. It’d be amazing if they do BOTH on the a7siii — I’d cry 😂😂
@superscientific It’s okay, this is a good first step.. haha
@superscientific Yes 😭😭
@Rendon_Shenron 900!!!!!!
@ChimneySwift11 HAHAHAHA yes. But it’s better than nothing. I was also surprised how good the on board audio was without a mic.
YO GUYS! THE NEW SONY A6400 HAS A FLIP SCREEN????!!!!   FULL REVIEW HERE: https://t.co/SdiJq5W0OP https://t.co/nmZigC7fOn

iPhone Xs camera vs Note 9: https://t.co/bgmmv432mc  Sorry Note 9, in almost every test you looked worse than the iPhone Xs. If you don’t believe me go look for yourself 🤷🏼‍♀️ I think only the Pixel can rival the Xs right now.

@HilzFuld @CaseyNeistat I love the zoom so far. It’s been cool to capturing shots of animals and things you couldn’t just “get closer” to. Did a shot of juggling with the drone above and could only get that shot using zoom cuz we’d have hit the drone with the balls.
Thinking of everyone in Jacksonville... 😞 so so awful 💔

I keep liking 14+ hour old tweets thinking they are new and looking like a real creep (This also goes for Instagram lol)   I do miss the days when chronological order was the standard. Everyone wants to tell us what they think we want but what about what we actually want?

@KljajicRijad Oh i love it!!!

@ImreNagyn This is clearly a joke and you don’t need to name call
@jennaezarik @DotEd Are we not friends
@emkwan Well my 2016 was also throttling so this doesn’t seem to be a new thing 😂
@runawaywithemma @ambron13 I’m not sure what either of you said
@DanStransky It didn’t overheat. It was working just fine.
I’m getting into playing fortnite in the kitchen. I feel like there are some really great jokes to be made but I’ll leave that up to the internet.

@JamesRath There’s an iMac Pro, 2006 MacBook below a 2018 MacBook, SSD, xbox controller, a plant and a FLIR one
@bsmittydotcom What did they change it to and from?
@iJB Just a test!
@DrTechGeek Interesting. I have 18 and a few other tests I did the MacBook Pro actually beat the iMac
@Maraiha_AMV So it’s weird bc it did have it after we added a printer from the network 😭
@vacifh @Dave2Dtv That was an unboxing not a review. I was very clear about that
@MHSgaming686 Yes haha!
@CConceptCreator @jennaezarik Jenna has been wanting to do this!!!
@DotEd 🥓
@MatJose2 I actually don’t NEED to do anything
What do you 👀 https://t.co/NZCzXLi7IN
@MihirAthale @Dave2Dtv I might have to do the fridge because I have a lot of pizza and ice cream in my freezer...
@SnazzyQ @knd775 @sandergulla Haha okay I’ll give it a try — thank you!!! :)
@SnazzyQ @knd775 @sandergulla Yeah, these were all pre-rendered so I guess most of the hard work was already done.. and then there’s the 18-Core iMac hahaha https://t.co/uNWCVQ1Ell
@SnazzyQ @knd775 @sandergulla Yeah it’s the i9! But then here’s the 2016 2.9 i7 exporting the same video https://t.co/feIyypppvg
@ScottMonty Hahaha a salad. So boring but 👏🏻
@SnazzyQ @knd775 @sandergulla Ok so then... what does this all mean.... https://t.co/Wpwh8ibMW3

@kevinbparry 😂 SO CUTE
@SnazzyQ HAHAHAHAHAH I’m actually laughing out loud
@davemark @Dave2Dtv @theloop @AbrasMateus I’m getting into fridge computing now
@CConceptCreator Thank you so much!!!
@MichaelSteeber Ok it looks far away so maybe not lol
@tldtoday Makes me so sad 😞
@LanceUlanoff @NYSE BAHAHAHAHAHAHFKCKSKSD LOL
@MichaelSteeber OMG I MIGHT HAVE TO
@SnazzyQ @knd775 @sandergulla Thanks guys! :)
@jaredmecham Haha, I had to delete everything on my old MacBook just to do the test because it kept filling up lol
@TechCycleYT @_henkost @Dave2Dtv haha I watched the video but it’s way faster than my 2016 and on par with exporting speeds of my 18-core iMac Pro in FCPX which is impressive. Throttling or not.
@jaredmecham haha it was 398 gigs
This is also without the eGPU — I tested that as well and it did nothing to speed up export speeds in FCP.
@actionjaxon666 @brentdson This is without eGPU. It didn’t effect the export speeds at all because FCP doesn’t really support it. Only with an external monitor or using a VR headset/editing 360 content.
@knd775 @sandergulla What’s the best app for activity monitoring? I’d love to test it out properly
Compressor times exporting my MacBook unboxing video (uncompressed 10-bit) on my fully maxed out machines:   iMac Pro - 7:20 2018 MacBook Pro - 7:44 2016 MacBook Pro - 11:15
@EiadAjam Im sorry, I missed the joke. I was stating a fact.
@mondobytes hahaha, I’ll start using hotel mini-fridges for my exporting
@sandergulla Haha yeah, I figured you were talking about that one video. I’m sure it’s an issue, but to say everyone after watching a single video isn’t fair
@sandergulla lol.. “everyone”?
@Le_Marquis_ I have one
My iMac Pro only beat my new MacBook by 24 seconds in exporting a video. This makes me super happy about editing while traveling!!   Still working on a video but wanted to actually use it for awhile before making it.
(Minus the suit and being a man)

@JoeDeStio @billpeduto @McDonalds @KDKARadio Oh man I’d have totally cruised through for a McD latte ☕️
@TmarTn FINE!!!! 😂😂😂
@TmarTn Doing a test today of it so will see how it does with exporting. What do you edit with?
@adamrucker @geoffkeighley You know there’s always an xbox and guest room for you here 😜
@JDTechTV Thanks so much!! 👏🏻
@tldtoday Thank you 😊
@superscientific Thank you!
@L337Lauren Haha I should just get one that actually works but somehow that seems too difficult
Omg I shouted so loud it printed from the wrong tray and it’s on 5x8 photo paper. I’m done, good night.

@jp_ocelot @Jauffins WHY ARE WE YELLING
@Jon4Lakers If we get a longer cable we can share!
@Jauffins I’m not sure. This is my first one so I don’t have much experience with them previously. I’m also not sure how much it’ll speed up things in FCPX for me which is what I’d really be needing it for.
It’s smol... https://t.co/Xe2tmHmlzi

@James_Barlett @jfwong I think do work hard, but saying self made is a joke haha.
@jennaezarik Tall depot
@JamesBenEmery She is sooo cute!!!!!
@jfwong Self made
@brookLensNYC Haha there actually is but this wasn’t a very good demo
I’m actually being very sincere but this feels like a parody 😂  Testing out the new “quieter” keyboard — it really is more quiet and has a softer feel when typing aggressively like I often do. https://t.co/wbfSnwamYa
@RafalKukla Hahaha it’s so funny it’s actually so exciting and I always say the same thing and I don’t even realize it until someone pointed it out today

Just started recording some VO and my neighbors start sawing their house apart. CRYING

@tldtoday Hehehehe
@TaimurAsad YES

@snobiwan He better
@RobSmaaagh Yeah I made up these screen shots.
@Nehalia I’m so upset. I sent so many great memes.
Follow up - I met my ✈️ airdrop friend when we landed. I gave him a cookie I didn’t eat from the flight. He’s never seen Hackers so he didn’t get my jokes 😂   THE END https://t.co/LgXlEdF8iI

I was trying to make amends after spamming. THEY CHANGED THEIR AIRDROP NOW TO ASK WHO I AM HELP https://t.co/wBnQeLGx15
THEY CHANGED THEIR NAME TO “STOP F’ING TRYING TO AIRDROP”  I AM ON THE AIRPLANE FLOOR LAUGHING AND CRYING RN
This was my favorite. They did NOT accept 😞 https://t.co/ZY0hXw8DCU
You guys... there is someone on this flight with the phone name virus.   I have been air dropping them Hackers movie memes and they keep DECLINING THEM 😂😂 I DON’T THINK THEY ARE ENJOYING MY 90S HUMOR #hackthegibson https://t.co/FDoiDZpye9

@MasonFarber @LinusTech @linusgsebastian Haha the option wasn’t clickable when we were filming — trust me I tried so many times 😂
@jennaezarik @TmarTn I told Jenna the same thing 2 years ago

@photojoseph It’s definitely different.. but how different technically I am not sure. It did have a softer feel to it when typing on it
@PRINCEALEXXX_ lol.. you’re drunk get off my timeline
Apple also partnered with Blackmagic on this new external GPU: It’ll give the 15 inch MacBook Pro a 2.8x graphics boost and 8x on the 13 — if I didn’t have an iMac pro this would be such a nice setup 👍🏻 https://t.co/Gh3NjEZWOT
@ransom_bryce Haha you’ll still hear it, but it feels much more smooth. I got a chance to try it out yesterday!
I probably edit over 70% of my videos  on my MacBook when traveling. This is a pretty huge upgrade from my 16GB memory, 2TB SSD, 4 core i7. Can’t wait to do an edit/export test.
New MacBook Pros announced today!! They look the same but are much faster and with a new quieter keyboard 🤫  + 15in 6-core / 70% faster + Up to 32GB DDR4 memory + Up to 4TB SSD + True Tone Display + T2 chip with "Hey Siri" https://t.co/aUjaB5FrdU

@jennaezarik DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT
@WayneStratton That’s actually happened
I prefer Black Jack and Roulette tbh.. anyone who has been in Vegas with me can tell the stories 🍿😆
@KEEMSTAR lol.. I wish every video was sponsored. Everyone thinks so just because I review things when in reality I buy a lot of it and I will probably be poor one day because of it.  Either way, at least it’s not CSGO gambling 😜
I don’t edit 360 footage often but I think I’m getting motion sickness 🤣 IS THIS A THING?
@K49HAS Oh well let me clear my schedule
@figureight Haha to be fair, I didn’t look at your profile until after I tweeted that 😂😂 so def not 45 or 12. I guess somewhere in the middle
@NetNobody @Constillate @figureight I’m giggling. Who wants to go to Vegas? Meet me at roulette. I’ll have candy.

@Adan_R_Aguirre I hardly do
@SmashUniversal I gamble
@andie_the_lab It’s pretty bad
@VovokAlantin @TeamYouTube @IGTelevision That’s a little harsh and they are NOT a YouTube replacement
@AManHasNoName7 @TeamYouTube @YouTube Haha to be fair, there have been changes that were needed but just the thought of my video going out with a random thumbnail I didn’t choose is my biggest nightmare COME TRUE
No I’m only giving up on trying to understand.. not making content. I actually gave up a long time ago tbh 😂 https://t.co/4pZBVHQZ1h

@Drjimwaters How about I’ll play the games that I want to play and you can shut your mouth and we can still be friends? 😂
Downloading Mario Tennis Aces AND LEGO Incredibles!! I’m ready for the weekend.
@jennaezarik @YouTube OH MY

@BertVedder Yay!!
@LinzDeFranco OH MY GOSH IT WAS SOME KINDA HEAVENLY CHIPOTLE SPICY MAYO SOMETHING DREAM — IM 💀
@jjulian Haha I’m not sure but I should have left way earlier so really it is my fault. It just takes so long to get anywhere there and extra long if something goes wrong lol. Hope you guys are enjoying the conference so far!
@LinzDeFranco I forgot I took a picture LOL https://t.co/0t5MSJqVdk
@jjulian I’m glad you guys made it! So sorry. We were stuck in the freight elevators in the back of the convention center!! 😭
@jennaezarik @tldtoday Well if you order in the next 2 hours 19 minutes you can have it tomorrow 😂
@LinzDeFranco If you’re at vidcon, Hyatt hotel room service 😂
@KawaiiGuyLA Hahahah zero
@littlelizziev Haha I wish we could have shared these together
I just had the most incredible chicken tenders from a kids menu. I haven’t truly lived until this moment — I am now alive.
@KawaiiGuyLA I’ve heard so many little kids saying the F word it’s shocking hahahahaha
@ColleenxTom U TOO!!!!
@johnbarta Lovely meeting you!!!
@The_Real_Editor You’re the best!!!! Nice meeting you!

@SuperSaf Hahahahahaha
@brianfagioli @Techmeme @Lucas_Shaw Haha! Thank you 😜 I don’t think I’ll be turning that on unless I knew I’d be able to fulfill those requests in the best way possible
@oliverbleopold Thank you for the book!!! So sorry we had to run! https://t.co/GmgAGGZT7X
@SuperSaf Also vertical video can’t really be viewed on an actual television....... so that was my huge issue with them calling it TV 😂😂
If you’re at vidcon come to my panel room 207 @ 11:30 🤗 see you later!
This is so incredible. I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve almost accidentally pasted text like this 😂😂 https://t.co/w94xEVWnV9
@SuperSaf Hahahahaha the best response ever
@desmonds @CaseyNeistat @MKBHD @davidrocknyc No
@zackatk77 It’s in the App Store, just download it
@kevinbparry Yeah it’s a pain just for fairly simple things 😭
@kevinbparry This may also fail terribly and no one actually bothers using IGTV.....
@kevinbparry I’ve started filming everything a little further away in the past few months so it makes it easier to zoom in and not lose too much. I’ve been loving editing vertical videos a lot! Just will now have to re-edit the same videos twice 😂
@GavinFree R u ok
@michaelcollado Hahahaha I like watching TV but come on
@Owennevulis That’s way too many names
I love the Instagram TV concept but hate that they called it TV.   “TV” to me isn’t what we should be calling the future of how we consume content. It’s what we are leaving behind and reinventing.   With that being said, I am very excited about it despite the name 😊 https://t.co/403s4vCsuy
@majornelson Hahahahahaha is this modeled after me? 😂😂😂😂

@vickimiko Well, that’s not me. I’m responsible for my actions and I’m clearly not burning kids or animals.

@brianfagioli @slashdot @Barnacules ..but with that being said YouTube can be a particularly emotional and mentally draining career if you can’t find a balance. I’ve been there many times and I’m sure it won’t be the last.
@brianfagioli @slashdot @Barnacules Ok but this happens in every industry, everyday.. it’s not specific to YouTube — it’s life.

@CaseyNeistat Love this! Would be the best tour ever
How many dongles will I need to make this display work with my old 2006 MacBook? Can’t wait to show you some of the gems I found on it 😂  Had to use the display as a charger because I couldn’t find the actual charger that would work with it. It’s a really heavy alternative. https://t.co/LPzk8vTyR3
