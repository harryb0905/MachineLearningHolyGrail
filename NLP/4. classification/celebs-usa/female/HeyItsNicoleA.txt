@Julesrox22 BC acting in film/TV doesn't involve a stage, I've never done theater before &amp; hate public speaking.
Sort of surviving my #UCB improv class but still having fun w/ it. Tryin to overcome the things that scare me most this year. #stagefright 🙈
@tinaabolduccxo Collins released OC's jar to scare Abaddon. It isn't clear why OC is stronger than Abaddon. Also don't know where OM is yet.
@rycbarme11 Collins stopped it &amp; smashed Original Calebs jar. Mirandas still dead &amp; Original Caleb was released, thus allowing them to meet.
Alright, West Coasters. It's your turn to catch the Winter Finale of #Ravenswood in 10 mins!! Hope y'all enjoy. 😘 http://t.co/j4ekOvDvo8

What'd you guys think?! Sorry I couldn't comment during the episodes, but I had fun answering your questions! Thanks for tuning in. X
@bumblebeeLee no I loved it! I took a couple of naps actually. :P
@DarianHardmon I love it! Homesick for it all the time. X
@krissiearnold I don't but I definitely get scared while shooting the episodes. It's made me a bit jumpy outside of work too. Lol.
@MikaylaRego She has no filter! I love that she's confident, strong and speaks her mind.
@spariaismydrug Audrey Hepburn. She's my idol. ❤️
@markysminaj Princess Jasmine! I was her two years in a row and wore the costume jewelry around everywhere.
@HarrysHoar I loved them! They were all so sweet and inviting. Made me feel very welcomed on set.
@Tatyanaaaax3 you'll find out for sure by the end of this episode. ;)
@Maddie_1317 Hocus Pocus!! My siblings and I loved pretending to be the Sanderson sisters. :)
@ellestreicher a bit of both! Miranda is tougher than I am but we have similar interests in music/art. Heathers way more of a girly girl.
@PllSLAT the yeah yeah yeahs! Fav band ATM is Daughter.
@ImHereToShowOFF thank you! I just got tired of my long hair and wanted to cut it all off. Michelle Williams inspired my super short cut.

@charlavail oh please, you're magnificent. and of course you're going to be in LA when i'm out of town! i'm in toronto until april 8th. :(
@Scatterfelt it's the lighting. my hair is essentially the same from when you last saw me. &amp; thanks, i'm halfway to looking good in yellow.
@Steelaw i can handle the triangle. i'll leave the ocarina to you. i look cross-eyed when i play it.
@charlavail because i'm aware of how obsessed you are with eyebrows, i'm extra grateful for that compliment. :) thank you.
@brianlogandales Okay. I thought so too but couldn't tell if it was because I'm stir crazy. Haha.
Subconsciously color coordinated myself w/ my book &amp; found it amusing. I need to get out of this hotel room #cabinfever http://t.co/tbnVqwbM

127 Hours with @KennAnderson. "I'm just saying.. if that was me in his situation, I'd still be at that effing rock." We know Kenn, we know.
@josloren I often think of your adorable little niece and randomly have the need to say "Babies! Babies! I want babies!"
Wakin up to a text from @Steelaw about french toast will only result in me craving it so much I'm now eating them during my phone interview.
Spinning on that dizzy edge I kissed her face and kissed her head, and dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow.

@Britrivera Agreed. And the Christmas tree one you brought me last night saved my life during my full on panic attack while watching Dexter.
Chasing the sun around for warmth today. Santa Clarita, you are cooolddd. And I feel cheated since you don't even have snow. Boo.
