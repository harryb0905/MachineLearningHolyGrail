It’s 8:08 pm.  In my room. Sunburned and exhausted. I’m amazed by anyone still out there. #DisneyTales
@stareagle @Jpbop5 @barcrawl65 @espn But even more impressive? The quickness with which said tools run with a narrative that is neither accurate or relevant. Imagine being so comfortable with being that ignorant.  Merely sheep mimicking others. #Sad
@stareagle @barcrawl65 Also...doesn’t understand how contracts work. 🤷🏼‍♀️😜

A week ago, we saw a little mouse. After a hilarious moment of screaming laughter upon initial discovery, it hit me that I’d have to put out a trap. At first, I thought, let’s just try and catch him and let him go.  I know that’s not realistic.  With much dread, a trap was set.

@SeanGrandePBP I 💚u.
@kevmancloud @united Then I’d tell them not to breed, please. Only a moron would think that’s normal procedure.

@BillSchulz I’m not an Astros fan anymore. I don’t have to be a fan to enjoy a night out with friends who gifted you the experience for you birthday.
@BillSchulz They didn’t.  I was an Astros fan. Went down to Houston for many games.  Had the MLB scores beeper. But I appreciate your concern. 😏
@BillSchulz Bucket list. (Plus once loved it.  Many moons ago.)

@roybragg @EvanG1126 @SpursCandle Thank you for tweeting this into my timeline. Like I tell people. Look at their previous tweets. Don’t waste your time. This one’s gone.
@roybragg @SpursCandle I’m also not a journalist.
A Saturday morning rant for me! Dammit...I’m being presidential again.
For those that prefer being asses, just know I kinda love the idea of you, red-faced, threatened, screaming into the abyss. Bless your ❤️
And for that, you’re welcome. To everyone else: open dialogue. Can’t we just be better? Isn’t it more fun when every person isn’t an ass?
And because of that I have a different perspective. Period. All I asked was ‘listen.’  And such outrage. (I guess some of you need content)
‘My upbringing. My father’s career. My income. My race.’ All things used by the boys to excuse my perspective. Been a woman thru all of it.
It’s silly.  The sad place we’re in.  If you’re not a close-minded pig, then guess what? Not talking to you. Methinks some are deflecting https://t.co/qV1QYNADGM
But I will say this, boys.  Thank you. Thank you for your predictability. And your willingness to take talking points from your overlord. 🙂
And to see what I’m talking about: Look who is most triggered in these comments. Why? Why not listen to another perspective? Is that scary?
I see my words struck a chord. A lot of comments from the very people I wish would listen. But I get it. Better to be triggered and mad. ❄️ https://t.co/jullJH0WTW

I'm not prepared for a world in which Jerry Jones and I agree on something.  This calls for a nap.

@BobbyMarks42 I can't even imagine. I just wanted to know why this guy thought he could tough it out in Miami Beach w/ two small kiddies. False confidence
@kchris87 @r11gofar Miami Beach specifically. I think it's safe to say he's putting his kids in harm's way, no?
@BROCK_SCOUT I hope he'll find some safety.
I suppose I should know by now that some people fancy themselves better equipped to deal with scientific matters than scientists. Not I.
@r11gofar South. Why else would I be confused?

I'm not 'triggered' because yesterday felt like a day full of chaos and uncertainty and I'm mad about it. We have friends that are affected
We're not 'snowflakes' for feeling sad when a 5 year old is kept from his mom for hours to make sure he's not a 'bad person.'
This past week goes beyond the 2 parties. And I realize that while we call each other names and scream, things are happening. Bad things.
I have voted for republicans. And I have voted for democrats. But I've always been most interested in how people will be treated. All people

Let's.  Do.  This.  @JTRevival https://t.co/oIT0zgCWF0
I'm not good at expressing myself. Leonard Cohen was.
This week needs music.  Not a moment too soon. See ya tonight, @JTRevival https://t.co/F6Kp83X1Bi
So upper deckers left in all the White House bathrooms then?
Mornin'. https://t.co/AUZpm5wmaO
So @ramonashelburne is stressed. #ElectionNight https://t.co/uCjWveSgbW

Oh....we're prepared. @KamBrothers @Rachel__Nichols @ramonashelburne @LisaJames32 #ElectionNight https://t.co/3kEgE2F6qw
Where's the damn pizza?!?!? #ElectionNight #WineNight https://t.co/mUXn4l7r7x
You nerds vote yet? There are a few down-ballot items that really tickled my fancy. No donuts… https://t.co/dYyABCCU2N
I'll do it with you. Can't be harder than NYC. I won't train either. Deal? https://t.co/QiB7MUFjHL
Dudes...I just got here Thursday, and I'm really looking to move into a sweet pad.  Hook a brother up. I'm Charlie. @PugNationRescue https://t.co/0lw4A7dZox

Turns out, I'm suuuuuper talented. #texas #canthelpit https://t.co/88nFLhIvYz
I've ended up in a bar.  And a dude with a raccoon tail hanging out of his pocket just walked by. Wtf, @ramonashelburne
@randymtz1 sssshhhhhhh
It feels like an HR issue, quite frankly. https://t.co/pIIGOK3KkZ
Spurs lose by 421 points so...saluti. https://t.co/izexchh3Mp
@LisaKerneyESPN like vocal twins. Not sure why I'm not on a stage somewhere, making people cry with my angelic sounds.
@LisaKerneyESPN completely.
Never ceases to amaze me that Bob Belcher and Archer are the same guy. And that I love them equally.
@AshokaESPN you've got a 20 headed your way, sir.
@HannahStormESPN @JalenRose @1MrBigShot Thanks chica!!
@arielhelwani Thank you! Can't call this a job. For real.
No love for the ocho, Chuck? @NBAonTNT
I'm uncomfortable.  But I also love confrontation. What do I do? #WarriorsVSThunder

Nothing in my life has ever made me cry as hard as 'Hotel For Dogs.' Happy tears. Sad tears. All the tears.
I offered bananas and Spurs memorabilia. Crickets. https://t.co/eR3yUn4xe4
The neighborhood just wiped us out. We had to put up a sign. I'm ashamed. It was like a scene out of Walking Dead. They. Just. Kept. Coming. https://t.co/6bF9E3eLWo
Moved into a new neighborhood.  Was told Halloween was a big deal here. I will NOT LOSE this battle. #CavitiesAreIn https://t.co/rKienUVD6E
I've got 300 lbs of candy, a Halloween tuxedo and lots of time. Let's. Do. This. Kiddos. https://t.co/ZnAJxABQtS

I'm stitching up my tearaway pants, revealing biker shorts for a little 'My Prerogative.' Will need a half hour for pre-song stretching. https://t.co/CgqhA8dHyX
Just spent the last 45 minutes working on some pretty cool robot noises.
I know something is about to happen now. (Tracy's not on Twitter. I mean....) NBA Countdown in 5. https://t.co/zfDADG9x2Q

Happy Opening Day. #NBA https://t.co/ZyC8Xj5UV5
Hey @DTLR....any chance we can get a five second head start before these bad boys sell out? Would guarantee good karma for life. #GoSpursGo https://t.co/T8o3jKz7N4
Has anyone ever made the recipe on the back of a Triscuit box?
I'm comfortable with ending this game here. We all lose. We all win. Life is beautiful.
I'm wishing so so so hard.  #DohCake https://t.co/nS9VGUsP5F
Thank you, all my furry friends! https://t.co/Si6KzXA5GB

I was always taught to choose my battles wisely. Whatever this is the Giants are doing seems to be the exact opposite of that. Bad look.

Maureen and Carla have been gone the last few nights. I don't judge or question their whereabouts. That's what makes our friendship work. https://t.co/Rqnz4RcSpZ
Hey @DIRECTV, give Salina anything she wants! After nearly 3 hours of frustration, she was the one who got it done. #HappyEnding
And after two hours, it can't be done!! Amazing. @DIRECTV
All I'm trying to do is add two receivers to my existing order. Have I stumbled upon an unsolvable equation, @DIRECTV? 1:48 and counting.
Am I being punked, @DIRECTV? (Not pictured the previous 36 minute call during which I was disconnected.) https://t.co/CSSigJ7xkd
In my 93rd minute on phone with @DIRECTV. Things I've done during this call: fed dogs, packed 4 boxes, ordered breakfast, ate breakfast.
What does one do after a concert? They make their dog feel uncomfortable with air guitar &amp; high volume singing. #ConcertInMyHouse #PoorLeroy https://t.co/emA4QoerYs

After hearing what he does with his hand, I wouldn't shake it either. #Debatenight
Also. I am not a Steelers fan. Despite that last tweet's unwanted emoji. You don't know me, Twitter.
I bet my savings on 'complete and total meltdown.' #debatenight #herewego
As if to express just how in the toilet all of this is, Leroy Jenkins just unleashed chemical warfare.  #debatenight #whatdidyoueatson https://t.co/625NTEe2fk

When your own party can't get off the sinking ship fast enough, perhaps some of you can save your 'what about her' tweets for day and think.

There is a large praying mantis on the door. The dogs and I are trapped inside. Please send supplies.
