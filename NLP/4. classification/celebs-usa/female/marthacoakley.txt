I look at the people who haven't had a seat at the table - who haven't had a voice. I want to be their voice, fighting for them. #NECNDebate

I have always operated in the best interests of children. I will stand on my record and protect our next generation as #magov. #NECNDebate
People need to understand how @CharlieForGov looks at a bottom line and doesn't see the people impacted by his choices. #NECNDebate
Factcheck: At Harvard Pilgrim Baker eliminated thousands of jobs, cut coverage for seniors, increased premiums by more than 150% #NECNdebate
Go for the gold! MA has the opportunity to make the investment, grow our infrastructure, and build a better city for the future. #NECNDebate
You look at giving tax breaks to corporations, whereas I look at investing in our people. #NECNDebate #magov #mapoli
Look at Charlie's plan - where is he finding $600M to pay for it? We have people begging for jobs, we need to invest in them. #NECNDebate
We need to prepare our kids for the next wave of jobs. STEM, early childhood education, training for the future economy. #NECNDebate
I believe we have the best ideas about turning the economy around for EVERYONE. #EarnedSickTime #earlyed #NECNDebate

.@JHouriet Mental health care absolutely priority. It starts with increasing access to care, and reducing the stigma: http://t.co/qelqDEAxeD
As CEO, I assume you’ve always had #earnedsicktime, @CharlieForGov, why should anyone else be treated differently? #YesOn4MA #magov14
I don’t think you &amp; I disagree on this, @CharlieForGov. I’m just willing to invest in it. &amp; you just talk about it. [on education] #magov14
Why should people trust you, @CharlieForGov, when you won’t make it clear that you aren’t involved [in pay to play politics w @GovChristie]?
After the “turnaround,” when your salary was $1.5mill, how do you justify outsourcing those 200 jobs to India? #magov14
I don’t want kids going hungry. I also don’t have much tolerance for people who cheat system. &amp; I have record of going after them. #magov14
Homelessness epidemic unacceptable, we have too many families &amp; too many kids…It’s got to be priority that we get these families stable.

Most families can’t wait until Apr 15 to pay their rent or put food on table…it’s why I supported #minimumwage, #earnedsicktime #UMassDebate
There are 1300 kids in the New Bedford area alone who, if we would be able to help them get #earlyed, would get a good start. #UMassDebate
I know how important it is to invest in our kids, for the chance for every kid to find a dream and follow it. #UMassDebate #mapoli #magov
Our ability to continue to maintain our infrastructure is crucial. #UMassDebate

I just want to say I'm very proud to be the first AG to challenge #DOMA. I stand by that decision, and I'm very proud of it. #wbzdebate
More affordable and integrated healthcare, it is the one way we are going to increase mental health care access for families #wbzdebate
The challenges we face ahead are not going to be solved by inciting fear and prejudice. #wbzdebate #mapoli #magov
We need a system that is fair to people…that means you need the rule of law…I do believe gov’t info shld always be made public at some time
The hardest decision was to head our child abuse unit…I worked across a range of cases that made me a much better D.A. #wbzdebate #mapoli
If we don’t invest in computer science and education for our kids, these biz won’t have workforce needed for those jobs. #wbzdebate
What I believe we need to do is start with priorities &amp; where we need to invest, in #earlyed, #earnedsicktime #wbzdebate
I’m the only one on this stage who has worked with families and sat with kids at DCF. #wbzdebate

We can do this. I ask for your support and your vote. http://t.co/N1o59OjRpL
Will you stand up with me?
I want to be your voice as Gov. To stand up with you, turn this economy around on our terms &amp; create jobs for everyone, wherever you live.
When I am Governor, we will treat mental and behavioral health the same way we do diabetes or cardiac disease.
Our job is to help our kids find a dream and to give them each the chance to follow it.
Now, I am ready, with you, to take on the biggest battles facing our next Governor.
Wall Street wrecked our economy...then got bailed out...today, Wall Street's doing fine. But so many working families are still struggling.
Do we continue to build an economy where all get a fair shot – or do we let GOP take us back to an economy that works for only those at top?
Fairness. Equality. Opportunity for all. Those are the values we stand for as Democrats.
I promise you this: There’s no one who is going to travel more miles, knock on more doors, shake more hands, or make more calls than me
Democrats, we’ve got some big shoes to fill….So here’s what I’ve been thinking: Maybe it’s time to replace those shoes with some high heels!
