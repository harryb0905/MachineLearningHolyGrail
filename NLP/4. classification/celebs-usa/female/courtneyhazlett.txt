@CaptSandyYawn @ColinMacyOToole @BravoTV Happy birthday!! So psyched for next season!
@meenasaurus Let‚Äôs start with, it‚Äôs not ice cream
@dennisfprescott Ok, maybe that is pasta I would eat.
@dennisfprescott Oooooooh shit...
@dennisfprescott It's raining here.
"As a movie, I did not love it, but as a reminder to get high and do some squats, I found it useful." Thank you @DaveHolmes for this McConaughey explainer. https://t.co/W4qzI6sKrq
Hey - I might! Can you DM me please? https://t.co/y1quj1CO0O
Hive mind LA, help please! Trying to rather quickly get my hands on two Glyph Atom RAID drives (4TB). B&amp;H, PacRad, Westpro and FilmTools all sold out. Other ideas?
@dennisfprescott Honored to share it with you üí´üçïüçç
@DrNancyMD You're very much making me want to take a trip to Montana these last couple tweets. Happy New Year!
@BillyBaldwin But actual autopilot is safe. This on the other hand....
@maskedscheduler Point about ER: it‚Äôs all from the POV of Mark Green, but the entirely of the series differs from that format. Thoughts? I like pilots to have format that is consistent.
@BenMank77 @johnpavlovitz So *that‚Äôs* where @JoshMankiewicz got that particularly endearing habit. Sounds like your dad was a quite a gent.
@KateAurthur Humans, the least we can do for the indomitable @KateAurthur is make this one of the most read stories on @BuzzFeed   Love you, Kate!
@lil_tortz @soniasaraiya @meenasaurus
@maskedscheduler @TheFienPrint I get that, but how difficult would it be to make social media vetting part of the process?
@KateAurthur You read the whole piece in THR, right? Fremdsch√§men!!!!
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Hard pass.
@kslosh That went on for HOURS.
@MarkHarrisNYC In other words, you‚Äôre tracking the movie perfectly. #swingandmiss
@echuckles What a fascinating piece!
@realDonaldTrump Go to bed.
@KeithOlbermann @GrantDenham It's devastating to bear witness. Sun just fully set moments ago; terrifying to think of what will be left in the morning.
@KateAurthur If only you didn't live 4 hours away!
The best post-elex piece. "... But he‚Äôs not Kornacki, who, even at his most chill, looks like he‚Äôs ready to volunteer to take the AP Government exam for everyone in his class just, you know, to raise their grades and help ‚Äôem out a little." https://t.co/GcEYG0vBKi
@JoshMankiewicz Is this your excited face @JoshMankiewicz
@dennisfprescott Preach, sir
@katiecouric Ruth Bader Spinsburg (my flywheel screen name). Judge on the top, spinning on the bottom.
@KateAurthur This six episode model presents QUITE A CHALLENGE to the international copro model they very much want/require
@realDonaldTrump Can't you attempt to unify, just once?
@billpeduto I grew up in Pittsburgh, and have been watching everything unfold from afar. Thank you for our grace and leadership under horrific circumstances. My hometown is lucky to have you.
@garveyshuffle As is mine. I'm gutted. I spent every weekend of my high school years in that exact neighborhood.
Do you see this @realDonaldTrump - it is a HATE crime. Not a security issue. https://t.co/ky7EyA3QoG
@DrNancyMD So is the First Lady's. This is gutting. I spent every weekend of my teenage years in that beautiful neighborhood.
My heart is broken. This is not the Pittsburgh I grew up in. https://t.co/miignbRcmC
@PRKrill If "unexcused absence" is in there we'll know something's up for sure.

Thank you for the absolutely perfect birthday message for me @Lin_Manuel   I and all the 10/2‚Äôs thank you. https://t.co/a2FKBfbJBL
@beckybratu So wonderful!!! Congratulations!!!
@garveyshuffle I never knew that. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm sorry but I think THAT SUCKS might be more appropriate. I adore you, @garveyshuffle
Enduring tweets from five hours ago twitter is bad enough on a normal day.
CASTING! For Netflix series I'm producing, looking for a design expert, pref with *restaurant* design experience (but general home/commercial space ok for right talent). It's a Canadian co-pro so must hold a Canadian passport. COME AT ME, TWITTER.
@KateAurthur @theferocity Not sure how I feel about that. The New York City of it was so great.
@DrNancyMD I hate that this happened to you. Sending you love. Miss you!
@KateAurthur No one outside the SNL demo knows who they are! Interested to see ratings.

@SouthwestAir At airport I thought extent of damage was unzippering, so my focus was getting my family (w/ 2 young children) out of the airport. I didn‚Äôt realize items were missing until I was home. Happy to call &amp; file an official report if that helps. #granolatheft2018
@SouthwestAir The thing is, your handlers also left the luggage UNZIPPERED, so by the time I received my bag at my destination my clothes were falling out. ‚ÄúApolgies, we don‚Äôt inventory‚Äù seems a little glib.
How very California of your baggage handlers to steal the granola I bought as gifts, @flyLAXairport, @SouthwestAir. Glad you‚Äôre being healthy but this was rude.
Just ran into @CaptSandyYawn in my nabe. I feel like I‚Äôve met Beyonc√©.

@principalcda @VisibleLearning Really like the WRaP acronym (and implementation) in the piece you linked to.

@KateAurthur @TVKubitz @BacheloretteABC Earlier @fleissmeister said no PT interruption

@MarkHarrisNYC He also seems to be self aware/mocking himself in a very human way. Aside from the, the movie is a clinic in plot, pacing, heroes and antiheroes. So underrated!
@DrNancyMD Hi! Would love to reconnect. I‚Äôm in LA now... shoot me a DM or follow back so I can say a proper hello!
@KateAurthur It‚Äôs flawless! Brendan Gleesan and Hugh Grant were perfection.
@KateAurthur What ground is possibly left to cover?!

@garveyshuffle Could not agree more
@realDonaldTrump Ok, simple question then: how did @MichaelWolffNYC get in the White House? Are you denying he was ever there?
@realDonaldTrump Please get off of Twitter.

Kings Speech better win after it narrates the category. #awk
think 10 nominees for best pic is too many? there was a stretch when they had 12...
@IamSauerkraut they didn't cut all of them out- just some. 3 of 5 if i'm not mistaken.
@RussertXM_NBC  new cut of Kings Speech is rated PG-13. They muted a couple f-bombs to make it so.
Sandra Bullock: what a pro. Let her host too, maybe. With the #ModernFamily cast even.
And Natalie gets best actresses. Oh, Annette. Many were pulling for you.
@SteveLevitan @Film114 Liked the promo? Understatement. Can the cast host the show next year?

Answer to which 3 movies swept pic, director, actor, actress, writing: one of them was It Happened One Night.  Which I've never seen...
answer to youngest winner: Shirley Temple, 1934, 6 years old
Fave thing I've learned all day: Helena Bonham Carter has NOT hired a stylist for the Oscars.
only 3 films have won for best pic, director, actor, actress and writing. Name 'em!
@kujoatc75 wins. Shirley Temple., in 1934. She was 6.

Is this just a d-bag tribute?
That looks like a pancetta dress on gaga.
kanye in 20 minutes? NO! The show's supposed to be over in 12 minutes! #onlybecauseihavetostayuptowatch
@thesurfreport re Gabi- they cut to her maybe 3 times? Not nearly as  many times as they mentioned that Nicki Minaj.
This time last year I felt bad for Taylor Swift. After that song, I feel like maybe it's time she let this go.
This is like waiting for santa claus.. COME OUT ALREADY, KANYE. #VMA
Lady Gaga changed into the leftover material from Will.i.am's outfit. #VMA
@thesurfreport Florence & the machine! Agreed, best of the nite!
there's something about singing live and running barefoot inside that really makes your song sound better. (p.s., who is this lady?)
So far, that Redskins touchdown is way more interesting than anything that's happened on #VMAs .
jesus h, nicki minaj's publicist deserves a raise.
the best part of the #VMAs so far- the stage is really incredible. production value amazing. way more mesmerizing than most the acts.
not even a pack of 8-year-old dancers could hide Bieber's really awful lip-syncing. #howthemightyhavefallen
@thesurfreport  Justin Bieber is so great, he doesn't get to perform INSIDE the theatre?  //you aren't missing much.
swear I just spotted the countess luanne's producer in the front row of #vma. #ohpleasebetrue
can't help but think Gaga's message about don't ask don't tell might have a little more impact if she was sans the william tell head-dress.
half an hour ago I didn't know who #nickiminaj was. oh, what I'd do to go back to that place. #vma

Snooki gets $500 fine, $33 court charge, and community svc. Judge notes her "affinity for animals." Dbl entendre not intentional, I'm sure.
OUCH! Judge says he thinks Snooki is a "Lindsay Lohan wannabe."
Judge says he has questions about how much of snooki's behavior was scripted ... she denies.
Snooki's attorney is argues her public drunkeness that brought her to court is "an anomaly" in a life well-lived.
Snooki's case is beginning. If only the judge called her Snooki instead of Nicole.

He is a valued part of our late-night line-up, as he has been for more than 16 yrs and is one of the most respected entertainers on tv.
newest NBC stmnt: We remain committed to keeping Conan O'Brien on NBC.

NBC statemnt also says Leno "presented some issues for affiliates..."
This from NBC: Leno is staying. Show performing "exactly as anticipated"

Taylor did not deserve that. And the prods cut off her sound when she finally got the stage back? Really?
I'm going to spend much of the rest of the nite trying to think of people less qualified to  mention health care than Russell Brand.

An attorney for Brown in the hallway tells me the restraining order stays in place.
Judge wanted proof that Chris Brown would be in a community labor program, not community service.

@ThePlaylist ditto Arcade Fire here at 30 Rock
@MeloraHardin Tx for coming on MSNBC w/ me over the holidays. Will you be back on the Office this spring? My readers have been wondering!
@MmmMmmGood catty?  won't change the world but photo integrity plays a huge role in newsstand sales & celeb's rep. look @ the big picture.
@ReginaMedina Headline should be "strangest casting decisions every made"
Valerie Bertinelli's thighs: victim of photoshop on the cover here? screen resolution issue? http://tinyurl.com/cn5zyr
@danaforshey UNC attracts great athletes, no doubt. I come from a Blue Devil family tho so I have to remain loyal.
@comoannie will keep you posted!
Can we stop with the Snuggie stories now? Please? I can't take any more trend pieces, pub crawls, slide shows, etc.
@ReginaMedina Thanks for the link! Interesting-wasn't aware.
@ReginaMedina one of the best things abt bad econ is days of being paid 2 sho up are mostly over.
@SDurrwachter but if I'm not mistaken, Kara wrote some of Kelly's early hit songs
@SDurrwachter Clarkson was not happy with idol post-idol accd to people I know close to her. She knows btr than 2 say anything anti-AI tho
American Idol wants Obama just bc he mentioned Simon's name? C'mon. Can't we leave Obama alone?
@JoeNBC my mom has pts in their 30s who R grandmothers public health/preven care legtn would cut costs-  gov't out of touch w/ practicioners
@JoeNBC re: Preventative care is such a prob, this would be grt opp to req PTs pay more for specialized tests if they're behind. win/win
Nexis training sesh has me wondering: how long till an iPhone app?  there isn't one already, right?
Didn't realize I missed Dora the Explorer's "makeover" so the companion controversy is coming as a surprise.
@ReginaMedina re: kindle. simplifies life. NYT subsript'n is grt and cheap, and iPhone app makes it even better. till buy some bks, not all.
@ReginaMedina look at $in/$out. hasn't had a hit film in years. supports fam, spends lots. I don't see her having lots of cash on hand.
how does Lindsay Lohan have the cash on hand for a Maserati? Does Maserti have good leasing programs? Not very recession of her either way.
@amomx3 and 33% of them would like to wish you a good morning too :)
@SherKro especially love getting my NYT via Kindle and I use even more now that it has an iPhone app.
@happylittletree I love it. I just wish they'd make it avail on Kindle.
@SherKro TONS of people are buying DVD. You're not alone! The Kindle's incredible tho- I'm by no means book-free, but can't live w/o Kindle.
Morning Joe at 8:45 today, talking abt AdWeek's top 10 magazine list, and is DVD dead?
Congrats to newlyweds David Letterman and Regina Lasko: http://tinyurl.com/c7xkp6
@kk074 not 2b cavalier, but the rest of the world returns to work when they're no longer sick/hurt. i don't get why actors get praise 4 it
does anyone out there still buy dvd's? if so, movies, tv series?
@MarkMcKeeJr Can't be too far off. Not sure how she'll have the time for that tho.
@LilyMazahery great question. I think good can come out if handled right- she's more accountable for kids' well being if eyes are on her.
@pjthexdj I read it a few years back and thought it was excellent. Screenplay  was supposed to come next, but then House came along.
@MarkMcKeeJr interesting take re: the Dr. It's to stretch to say she's "profiting" though. Defraying costs at best.
@LilyMazahery ah, yes. More kids came home, more coming home perhaps as early as tmrw.
@LilyMazahery Why what exactly?
just missed Hugh Laurie in the hallway. Tragic. Want 2 kno when he'll finish screenplay version of his  book,"The Gun Seller."
Talking about the latest with Nadya Suleman on MSNBC 11:30ish.
@andrwgo oh, the women played too?
@arby57 nope- things were running behind so I'll be on tomorrow instead.
@andrwgo yeah, that must be it! Guessing you didn't see it?
FYI, I'll be on Morning Joe tmrw morning since ran over today...
@RyanSeacrest and Meredith's explanation from the show today- http://tinyurl.com/cr6q4r
@RyanSeacrest He veered on his bike to avoid deer- dislocated shoulder.
@MiramaxFilms Through @theplaylist for me. Thx for Kennywood/Adventureland linkage. Will share via my Scoop column as well.
@marramark the logjammer is still the gold standard for all water rides, in my opinion.
Hey fellow Pittsburghers: Kennywood/Adventureland behind the scenes from @Miramaxfilms via @DAVEandDAVEshow http://ow.ly/1gNq
@AdamVerdugo this is the best march madness in recent memory
@Ladyhawke1043 I was on vacay when book news erupted, glad you brought that up. Renewed sympathy makes more sense now.
Pitt wins, I can get on with my Sunday now.
@Ladyhawke1043 I'm mystified by this topic- people out there really care? Pls shed some light on what people are talking abt re: these two.
@DukeStJournal haven't had a chance to really delve into the numbers yet, but i'll do something on it one way or another tmrw. Thanks!
@liveklg they're pretty private (depsite the matt damon stuff) but I'll look into it. thanks!
@pjthexdj will look into it. thanks for the suggestion.
@DukeStJournal interesting. was the audience a pretty solid mix of men/women? I think julia's really been missed.
Getting to work. Scoop devotees--what are you curious about this week?
