Loving it!!! @Refinery29 has the exclusive of my @KCRW performance of 'Friday Fish Fry' - check it out here: http://t.co/JPngg3LQV4
.@NPRandB @TwitterMusic Thank you! Loved doing this! :)
.@yo_tyrone @NPRandB I'm inspired by everything that has happened&amp; is around me.Wanted this record to be something I sing for a long time.
.@Nipseh @NPRandB No because it's all music. My dad used to tell me it's the same keys on a piano, same notes for any song.
.@hribstar @NPRandB Never say never!
.@abesuxx @NPRandB I initially jokingly told someone that I was going to call it FOOD, and I decided I liked how it sounded so I kept it!
.@so_treu @NPRandB Both are great outlets. I like that I see my personality consistently in both!
.@HBQIC @NPRandB I never think about things like that. Just try to make something I'm proud of, and I think it usually resonates.
.@OliviaMerrion @NPRandB Bran muffin and bacon during the week. And orange juice always!!
.@iconique  @NPRandB Just that you need a refresher... or a cool down.
.@HBQIC @NPRandB They're all personal to me. They're all a piece of me.
.@IAreJordan @NPRandB I was thinking about James Bond, and I wanted it to be one of those 60's Bond moments!
.@NPRandB @RLY94 Didn't think about what it would be too much, but while making it knew I wanted it to be something that would be great live
.@NPRandB @Cassidy_T63 Sal Masekela sings on 'Bless the Telephone' with me
.@NPRandB @ruthetam Probably that they use too much fire, and over think the process. It's a lot of common sense.
.@mjwc97KILLS @NPRandB I didn't find anything hard to record. It's what I do :)
.@KCcommander @NPRandB All kinds of different music. Depends on my mood.
.@Plubel @NPRandB Runnin is about human contradiction. It's want and not want; enough and not enough. Just knowing I'm never alone.
.@NPRandB I wrote a whole other song &amp; it wasn't right. I went back in &amp; rewrote it - that's when Floyd came out!
.@_FangBang @NPRandB Love that song because it's conversational, it's about being at peace with where you're at, and the comedy of real life
.@NPRandB @basimbambaataa Not sure what I would change it to, but if I had to rename one it would be Wonderland.
.@NPRandB Jerk Ribs was great - Loved that we had strings and horns! It was a day where we could get everyone in and I made Jerk Ribs! :)
.@NPRandB @punkybluester Yes! Just announced dates this morning!
.@NPRandB @straightshine Yes! And it changes everything. You see yourself differently, you see life differently. You learn what love is.
.@NPRandB Can't wait!! Everyone don't forget to send questions using #AskKelisNPR in your tweet :)

Hello skream, care to do a video? Awwww,  I understand your a very busy man but please pretty please, lets make a video :)
It would be done without me. "Huh" that was my response. Then I tweeted it  cause i decided that sucks n makes no sense. So, finally.
Done but couldn't get a response from skream or his team FOR AGES! Come on guys , be real. And finally this am I was told no big deal
Lol yeah I'm a prima Dona , sure. WRONG! It took twitter power and friends to help point out the fact that I've been trying to get a video
Well beauties, I have to go take my midget to school. Tell skream to shake "it" off and stop being ridiculous! Lol God speed! Xoxo
But skream makes me wanna scream! N not in a good way! Lol
I wanted to do something in black and white for the video. Almost like 60's sound stage or something. I can see it in my head. Glorious
I promise to release it this year.
Ceyda! Hi mama! Lol love you
Anything musically in quite some time.
Joshie, it's hard to describe but of course it isn't like anything I've done before. I love it! And to be truthful I havnt loved
Lol sorry Kevin, no I've never seen that done. Do people really do that? How come?
And we love him!
Since it's taking me forever to put out my album. Which btw is coming out spectacular!!!! You will Jadore! Dave is a special creature
Well the whole point of me puting out copycat was because I love the song, it's fun (and true) and I thought it would be nice
Skream in this alternate world he lives in also doesn't think that's a good idea! Lol that leaves me speechless!
And friends it gets better, we all know Rankin is brilliant and a dear friend of mine. I wanted him to shoot the video, naturally.
Lol thank you! That's what I said! In what alternate universe would skream be more fun to watch in video then I would be singing my song!
Does that make any sense at all? Hilarious , Seriously
Good morning! So I woke up thinking about a video for copy cat. Problem is skream some how thinks I don't need to be in it. Lol
Fantastic! http://t.co/s7JP34H9
Oh and , drum roll. I'm super excited cause I've been in the studio with Dave sitek who's wonderful.
On the other hand I love love love hgtv!

I never do stuff just to do it, or just for the sake or sale. I don't mean to be pretentious or rude so never take it that way.

That's why it's my vision, that way there will be no apologies needed. It's not for everyone. No one or no thing is for everyone.

Something miraculous happened. I saw a guy eating a sandwich. It looked like pulled pork, I thought to myself. No it couldn't be, not here.
Today I came and danced with the citizens of cambridge university, I honestly didn't know what to expect. But we had a great night! And then
Wonderful

I didn't think to make that clear at the time because I was shaken and furious. Now you know.
And that's when fat pink faced british guy who was on the plane with me called me a slave and to call him sir. It was at passport control.
I took a flight from gatwick back to spain so for those fact checkers that is approx 2 n a half to 3 hour flight. I landed in spain
Just to clarify, because apparently there's been some confusion. I was in the uk (as always) this time for bestival (which was great)
And what does that help. I could go on and on. I won't. But maybe someone will start to talk about it from here.
Against something no one is willing to talk about or even admit exist. Everyone wants to be politically correct. But who really cares?
But its NO SECRET! And that I can fight against. I can try to prepare and teach my son. Because its out there. But you can't fight for or
Smorgas board (spelling?) Of disgusting racial problems. We are the poster child for racial inequality even still with a black president
Not mentioning a problem doesn't make it go away. I bring it up now because as an american it is abundantly clear that my country has a
Decades behind progression because everything is swept under the rug. People don't talk about it. People don't fight about it.
For a lot of reasons. But I am in london all the time and today I'm gonna say that the racial issues in the uk are disgusting. Its racially
Anyway, it made me think. This person was aprox a 50 year old english man. I didn't say anything at the time of the riots in London
Or how that pig deserved. But #1 my gorgeous baby boy was literally sitting on my hip and #2 I'm a believer. And we are better. Sposed to be
Over 50 people said nothing. I mean literally nothing. Didn't flinch. We all no I'm no saint, so I retaliated. Not the way I wanted to
Head in agreement I guess, and said "kunta kinte". All the while the entire line full of people I just sat on a plane with for almost 3hours
Probably a disgusting nigerian. He called me kunta kinte and ranted and raved some more. The man behind the passport desk laughed, shook his
This fat red faced sweaty "man" (I use the word man loosely here) started calling me a slave and told me to call him sir and how I was
Cut the line. Which wouldn't be far fetched of me but this time I actually didn't (not entirely anyway) well the point is from 0 to 60
We just landed and I had the midget with me. we get in the passport control line and apparently pissed this one man off cause he thought I
Is "what would you do"? Or how do people react when they see injustices. I love the show. Its interesting. However today that didn't happen
There's a show in the states, I think its on dateline or something like that. The host is a spanish man. Basically the premise of the show
I think they are showing the festival on sky arts. Watch it :)
Bestival was fantastic! And I didn't get stuck on the island so I'm even happier about that! Wepa

Deep thoughts
And a masseuse should not lean in close to ones face while giving a massage!
Word to the wise, a masseuse should NOT talk while giving a massage. A masseuse should also not ask personal questions during a massage
So my summer tour shannanigans is coming to a close. I would like to say that belgium by far has some of the best most plush hotels.
P.s I just bought an armadillo purse :) wepa!
I do enjoy pissing of vegetarians, lol there feathers are so easily ruffled. Good times lol I'm surrounded by them its the least I can do!
I prefer it at sea world or in the sea. Because it was not delicious at all. But u know I had to try!
So we did a festival in tromso norway today. Its beautiful here. Had a blast. Oh and I tasted seal. The actual sea creature at seaworld.
Ok, so I had a craving for nandos the yesterday and I heard there is some kinda secret society of people with @Nandos_Official  black cards.

Oh! So nicky encouraged (basically enforced) me to buy these shoes yesterday. She kept saying how comfy her clogs were. Well let me tell you
I keep buying the wrong thing, problem is I keep eating it. I jus want a lil dark chocolate crunch. Is that too much to ask?
We are headed to bristol now, sidebar. I've been a bit of a chocolate junkie lately, when I say nougette I mean the delicious crunchy stuff

So happy, I feel quite special. :) for my next trick...... Awww I can't say. But it does involve my new deliciouso jamon!
Another name for it is jamon imbierco (I think) anything that starts with "jamon" makes me happy. But this is the truth, the mother load.
I am so excited! I just bought my first full pata negra! Actually I got a shoulder which is better. And I was convinced to buy the boot!
And I'm in dublin, wepa! Good times

So after our opening night in l.a (glorious) I was kinda just standing around in deep thought (jack handy lol) when this guy says to me in

P.s I'm late I know, but did anyone notice how boring mtv movie awards were except for my Favorite human Will Ferrel. (He can do no wrong)
Kiddies!

Ok I just noticed my tweet never went through. Annoying, but I am on to new thoughts. So moving forward its gay pride this weekend

With people I know , much less some stranger in transit. So scratch that last part lol. I'm jus sayin, really people lighten up a little!
Sitting next to on the train, plane, or automobile. Ok now I'm getting beside myself I do not actually want to have a full on conversation
And people just don't respond I mean seriously. Even on a bad day is it that hard to pretend to be civil. You never know who you may be
This really is the best time to be in ny. On a side note, I hate when I get in an elevator or in a cab and say "hi, good morning" and smile

Charlotte. Not happy needless to say. I didn't even bring it up Cause the whole day was just appalling. Any how I'm walking into the
I painfully watched the plane I was sposed to be on just sit there and eventually take off without me on it. I then had to fly into
Airport experience. Which as u may have begun to gather is easier said then done for me. I had a nightmare of a day the other day as
Rise and shine and give God the glory! I'm up and headed to miami for winter music conference. Super fun. However we must get through the

I feel a long weekend coming on in my future! Woohoooo!
I'm in atlantic city, which when u first think about it sounds smokey and old. But maybe its the hotel I'm at cause it feels like vegas!
That will not be going home with me this morning. Ugh, not happy......
Filled with treasures to come barreling down. That is not the case here. I am too tired to even weep over the loubiton, westwoods, etc etc
Indignent attitude as though I'm the horses ass for wanting my stuff back. Or excuse me niavely, blindly optimisticly expecting my trunk
My carryon, still not happy about this. And its not just the lost of my stuff that pisses me off. Its the person behind the counters
The good news is however that I don't trust these airport scoundrels, so all the glorious treats I had made for video are nicely packed in
Oh did I mention I have a 9am call time, which would be fine if I wasn't still here staring at this empty baggage conveyor belt. Not happy
I am at airport, sans luggage not happy. How is it that they "lose" bags? Does that make any sense? Let me answer, no it absolutely does NOT

Hey there all. I was just called by my very excited manager screaming on the phone that my song "acapella" is #1 on the billboard
Are now clean (phew) crap like that gives me anxiety lol ok moving right along I have no idea what to wear to plush tonight.
This. And those that do know our good pal Neil drop it. It was a simple misunderstanding. I hope this at least makes u laugh Neil. My hands
(Obviously too much fun to stop) lol so there I feel better. For all of u who don't know who I'm talking about,get over it, I owed at least
Brass and offensive in conversation with you and NOT on this entirely too excessable proven scary freedom we now have called tweet lol
Directing that at you. So I repeat I was not talking about Neil Jacobson lol just to be clear. If I was, Neil I assure you I would have been
To you NEIL JACOBSON, I was not secretly cursing u on a tweet lol (what's the world come to) I do hate kiss ass a&r's however but I was not
The other day I said something to the effect of "kiss ass a&r". My a&r who is really my manager (don't ask) was pissed. So this one goes out
Misquoted or misunderstood for lack of clarity. So this is not a recant or even an apology for that matter as much as it is a clarification.
Make many apologies for myself. And I hardly ever take back anything I've said. If I say it chances are 95% I ment it. However I hate being
Was talking about n I didn't care. So I told him basically to leave me alone. Anyway blah blah blah, here I am. I have never been one to
I was dehydrated from the "vegas night" starving and in no mood for his shinanagins. Particularly because I had absolutely no clue what he
My dismay this morning (nice way of saying down right irritated) when I got a text from a friend saying "yo that tweet u sent was not nice"
Vegas was fun as usual, of course the after effects are it hurts to live the next day. Small price to pay I guess lol but u can imagine my
And p.s south west airlines is really just a nice way of saying 1974! Lol
I wear a ton of jewelry, won't remove my scarf or God forbid a hat and I have an admitted serious problem with authority lol
Of course I'm just bitter because I've been hearing the resounding ring of "female assist" for the better part of a decade. Its my own fault
That 75% of the time there just a bit pissed off ur goin somewhere and they aren't. Just a thought. Come on, you've thought it too.
Tsa, is that an acronym for mentally retarded ? Granted some of them can be nice and even a light bit helpful but doesn't it just seem
I love vegas, gonna be a good night!
And yes I had a few glorious beers this evening. Its been ages! thank goodness it was a good night :) xxoxox buenas noches friends n others
Ha, made you look ;) xoxo
Have fun and stay true to myself amidst a world that is prone to smother difference. Who cares if u get it or even like it for that matter
Gifted, not the best performers or dancers. Its the people we believe. Who do u believe. Whatever, point is I reminded my self how to still
Responsibility. We all have to. Yes you. I have always said the best music comes from people we believe. They don't have to be the most
How drunk do I have to be on a regular basis to let this crap slide. I'm not bashing or hating I just can't help but take some bit of
And can't be new or thought provoking. But seriously don't lie 95% of this stuff is just down right BORING! Like snoozer, nap time. I mean
Absolutely. I can get a lil leant to the side in a party just as much as the next chick and have a ball. And I agree that all music shouldnt
That to me sounds new.... I hear the same radio you hear. And again truth be told do I sing along and enjoy its ignorance is bliss reality
In an annoying preachy self rightous way cause that's just as annoying as the ass kissing a&r but I mean I seriously try to put out music
Sonicly perfect songs that never see the light of day. I will be honest, and take this how ever u please. I try to stay true to myself not
Involved. Honestly u have no idea. I find myself fighting relentlessly every album. But at the end of the day why? There are wonderful
Thoughts, hell children (a little dramatic but u get my drift) hard as hell. I don't like this part. There's so much business and politics
I'm at the stage where I have to choose what songs I will put on my album. It is not a fun game to play. Its like getting rid of moments,
It all off. Brings me back to ground zero.
Tired, the hours were crazy. I feel good though. I think it will look just like it did in my dream :) I baked all day today, helps to shake

P.s bill gates is here. Dope but obviously super white :) I'm from ny I'm accustomed to a bit more options lol. Not cause anyone wants it
Like this. Where r the brown people black, spanish, asian, indian anything dang. I mean the "others" lol just a thought..... Mull that over
Ok sundance is totally fun n everyone is really nice n happy blah blah blah (all true) but seriously it becomes so evident at events like
Such a shame xoxo
Its stuck to my lip gloss and on my eyelashes its honestly worse then soot. So pain still is beauty, but I draw the line at cotton mouth!
Looks like the bad side of velcro. Knight is furious with me as he doesn't understand where all this fluff surrounding him is coming from.
Everywhere I've been. I'm convinced its in my lungs, in my mouth of course my pants are covered, the poor guy stuck next to me on the plane
In it. But oh contrare my friends. This dang sweater has been my demise all day. It is making me nuts I have left a trail of vibrant yellow
For it. so naturally when I purchased my delicious canary yellow cashmere mohair blend sweater I was prepared and ready to take on the world
Ok so you know I firmly believe that in most cases pain is beauty and we must take our fashion seriously which sometimes mean suffering
On the other hand I have been writing and recording though just about officially done with my album finally. Not even the rain can stop that
Ok so its torrential rains in la and I'm over it. Sick and tired between the cold and moisture everywhere I go. Now I have a cold. Not happy

Rape you for the cost of ur ticket, at least virgin n emarites buy u dinner and a movie. Lol seriously pure luxury! Get into it! Xoxo
Is simply sub par. Treat yourself, go on a trip. Its worth it. The u.s airlines need to step it up, seriously. They all (airlines)
Virgin is glorious, every part. They have there own security, they let u take the stroller on board. Its glorious honestly! Everything else
Ok, here r the facts. If its not emrites  (spelling), or virgin airlinesn it should basically just be shut down. Best 2 airlines ever
Yay!!!
