Oh, thank you so much~!!!! https://t.co/e1wNvLjeiB
@SnarkWorld The nude pumps at the start. The brown knee high boots (which I now have) and the Prada pumps from the 1st flashback.
@caitlin_lore to tell the truth… they are DJ Tanner’s. ;) I borrowed them from Fuller House ;)
That walk and talk scene with Charlie was my favorite scene in the movie. God sends sleighs… do we notice? Do we see them? Does fear hold us back? #AShoeAddictsChristmas #CountdownToChristmas
@iam_jelsy @hallmarkchannel Right?! Best line of the movie!!!
Who’s your true love? I’ll tell you, the one who is always there, knows you best, and will never leave you…  is God :). #AShoeAddictsChristmas  (and my personal opinion)- cause this is my feed! hehe
What?!!!! What do you think about what just happened? #AShoeAddictsChristmas  Is he the one?! #CountdownToChristmas
@herrin_carly Mine too!
@bcarliesue1226 Thank you! That was my favorite for sure!
This dress and look was my favorite in the movie! #AShoeAddictsChristmas #CountdownToChristmas
This is my FAVORITE scene of the WHOLE movie right now!!! #AShoeAddictsChristmas
@JenniferBigham4 I think you’re feeling the movie ;) !!!!!
@kristacarrolI I think that was Ted Baker
@irishgino @hallmarkchannel thank you!
Yes I did! All the food must be fresh and edible. ;) #AShoeAddictsChristmas https://t.co/IhNHL7SKTo
After the movie, if you follow me on Instagram, I’m posting on my STORIES- a little play by play ;) #CountdownToChristmas  #AShoeAddictsChristmas
Thank you!! I think the HUMOR is such a fun surprise and different for a @hallmarkchannel movie. Glad you’re loving it! https://t.co/waXPrhiBtt
@aliciabrooks86 the green one? I think it was Ted Baker
@tammyr72 Agreed! It’s by Ted Baker
I just ADORED Luke MacFarlane!!!! Such a sweet and down to earth man and great actor. I was SO excited to work with him.  #AShoeAddictsChristmas #CountdownToChristmas
@Lemon_and_elm We had a combo of both!!! Real and fake snow #AShoeAddictsChristmas #CountdownToChristmas
All the movies have professional hair and make-up artists that get us ready each morning. I take about an hour ;) #AShoeAddictsChristmas #CountdownToChristmas https://t.co/GqLdzY5YtJ
@trevor_radio @Producer_Brent @ZachKDWB @hallmarkchannel @VanessaHudgens hehe ;)
@tazrock71 @hallmarkchannel yes!
Here comes the APRON you can buy from @DaySpring https://t.co/0fTYZY2rcY and ALSO enter for a chance to win it tonight!!! #AShoeAddictsChristmas
It was my assistant Bailey’s hat! I think she got it from a street vendor in NYC a few years ago! I was super cold one day and I grabbed it off her head and wore it in the movie! haha. #AShoeAddictsChristmas https://t.co/7xoKkTuEni
YES. I work with a costume designer and ultimately decide what I like best. On this movie, I brought a lot of my own dresses and was very specific as to the look I wanted. #AShoeAddictsChristmas https://t.co/MjnhrEeTDW
Nope, I’m pretty used to it at this point ;) 37 years!!! #CountdownToChristmas #AShoeAddictsChristmas https://t.co/f7Ot0AIoql
@KarlaHale13 @hallmarkchannel YES! An old train station in Winnipeg.
I laughing seeing my #StarKist tuna and chicken creation commercials during my movie #AShoeAddictsChristmas  #CountdownToChristmas
@24_JG_24 I like it more festive and fun!
@KeWhite80 I like it long best - but short is just easier.
@CM_Mayberry @DrLancerRx Make-up is only as good as the foundation it as to work with ;) So, I’d say BOTH!!!
@klenny152 you are right!!! And thank you!
Most of them were my personal shoes :) and Yes, any that weren’t, which were only 3 pair, I kept. hehe #AShoeAddictsChristmas #CountdownToChristmas https://t.co/J0rBgsRHhy
@ladyluke05 Prada
@grandrunning @hallmarkchannel MIne ;)
@payitfwd_arrow @MMjewelry Club Monaco
@michellea1487 YES!
@ChrisStewart99 Winnipeg!
@gr3n0uill28 @hallmarkchannel Club Monaco
It was really snowing during the horse and carriage ride scene! Unexpected and PERFECT! #CountdownToChristmas #AShoeAddictsChristmas
There is alway a costume designer! However, Several of the dresses and shoes were my personal clothes ;) And all the jewelry is by @MMjewelry !! #CountdownToChristmas #AShoeAddictsChristmas https://t.co/3SaeAQ2s7I
Behind the Scenes- that cute gray snow hat is my assistant Bailey’s. It suddenly snowed one day when we filmed in September and it was so cold that I asked if I could borrow her hat- and then it stayed in the movie!! #AShoeAddictsChristmas #CountdownToChristmas
I do! I’m a certified shoe addicts myself! That’s why I chose this movie!!! ;) #CountdownToChristmas #AShoeAddictsChristmas https://t.co/fnnMnUGnmK
Probably 15 pair of shoes in the movie. But I brought about 30 pair from home ;) #CountdownToChristmas #AShoeAddictsChristmas https://t.co/gAWmI0u71x
Well? Thoughts? Isn’t Jean Smart hysterical and Luke MacFarlane so handsome and adorable? #AShoeAddictsChristmas #Countdowntochristmas @hallmarkchannel

Catching the remake of No One Would Tell with @dohertyshannen - Well done.  It’s such a sad and awful real life story. Abuse, verbal &amp; physical is NEVER ok or justified. Tell someone if you’ve been hit or hurt.

Here’s the real question of the night for #aurorateagarden fans… Are you hoping Aurora gets over Martin and moves on to know Nick better or that Martin comes back?
@HallmarkiesPod I love them all, but thank you for loving ours so much!!!! ;)
YESSS!!!!! I have the BEST mama!!!!!! Go Aida!!!!!! @therealmarilu #aurorateagarden
@jnweaver24 @LexaDoig @TheRealMarilu @niallmatter @hallmarkmovie LOL- that’s the perfect gif!!! hahaha
You’re right!!! Good job Sally. Finally! haha #aurorateagarden https://t.co/lyNbJVM0IQ
@NealFine3 It’s the same for all of them. The filming is 15 work days. Pre and post production is much longer than that.
Guys, how are you liking the short hair? I think I’m gonna have Aurora go back to strawberry red and grow it back out. #AuroraTeagarden

And how gorgeous is @therealmarilu ?!!! She is so stunning I can never get over it. #AuroraTeagarden
I think it’s time for Arthur and Lynn to embrace Aurora as she helps in future cases. Maybe they can hire her instead of pushing her out. #AuroraTeagarden
FANTASTIC!!!!! HAHA I loved working with @NiallMatter - he has the BEST story about how he and his wife met! #AuroraTeagarden
Working with @niallmatter was….. um… how can I say this without being….. um  #AuroraTeagarden

@RPopBox Maybe….
@NancyProvenzan1 @hallmarkmovie Not really. I’m never two steps ahead of everyone else LOL #AuroraTeagarden

Long before becoming a New York Times bestselling author, I dreamt of writing children’s books you’d want to read to your littles. I am excited to share my first children’s book, “Candace Center Stage!” It releases in Oct, but is avail for pre-order now! https://t.co/RMcFh1hm3h https://t.co/KbC2F2KzZa
@goofygirl66 Doesn’t ring a bell. And I went on very few dates in my life so I’d think I’d remember 🤔. What school?

@adrianjesscoach @stephmb75 I think soft pink/blush or light purple will be prettier than nude. Or blue - that’s my style opinion!
@stephmb75 @adrianjesscoach Some of thsee styles will work great! Maybe you can find some even less expensive- but those are good finds 😉

@frostflower46 and not because I knew the outcome, but because Hallmark would never leave fans in despair- they always give us hope! That’s why we tune in, right? I trust the Hallmark brand and they didn’t disappoint. Blessings.
@frostflower46 exactly- time heals! Too many fans were willing to quit the show after the first 2 minutes- and that’s who I was responding too. it made me sad to see those comments.
@LisaTownsMyers1 @hallmarkmovie @TheRealMarilu Miranda was pregnant in real life- and due while we were filming. We wrote hat her character Lynn was pregnant and on bed rest

@JEvans96474901 @hallmarkmovie correct! And hopefully the last for Aurora
Now tune into When Calls The Heart with @LoriLoughlin and @erinkrakow on @hallmarkchannel
Thanks for watching Sluethers!! I’m so glad you loved this mystery so much! So did I! Until next time… #AuroraTeagarden @hallmarkmovie
Aurora kicks butt!!!!! #AuroraTeagarden
@TheRealMarilu @hallmarkmovie Stunning!!!!!
@Lmkoller1 He’s in the next movie. They messed up the movie posters ;)
Thanks Marilu!! It is still my all time favorite Hallmark movie of mine :) https://t.co/fe4bGunYNN
@sgsessoms YES! We can keep the movies coming!
We are coming down to the end!!!! Who done it? #AuroraTeagarden
@MetacarolineR @yerutherleft1 @niallmatter @hallmarkmovie You’ll have to tune into the next one to find out!
This is such a good mystery!!! I even know who did it, but re-watching has me guessing all over again! #AuroraTeagarden

@TheRealMarilu @hallmarkmovie yay!!!!
I’m laughing at how much I’m on Hallmark channel! The movie, the previews for Home and Family, Starkist commercials…. Yay!! Thanks @hallmarkmovie
@RafaSjc7 @hallmarkmovie usually whatever scenes when I have a TON of dialog to memorize!
@RadiantSunset7 @hallmarkmovie @LexaDoig @RealCharlaine @TheRealMarilu I always go there too- whoever seems most harmless
@Demis_potato Ha! Some sparkles dropped in my make up bag, so for two days we couldn’t figure out why I had sparkles on my face! Finally found the source and got a new bag
@anistonlopez @Trontasia Niall actually isn’t in this one. He’s in the next one. Hallmark mixed up the movie posters- oops!
We were actually very professional on this one and didn’t break too much! But Aurora #3 was terrible… we couldn’t stop laughing. https://t.co/09JzQz0pOV

@JenniferBigham4 @DeroseMick yup! You got it!
@matthew_akers Not at all! It’s my mystery series on @hallmarkmovie channel. I play Aurora Teagarden!

@TheRealMarilu @HomeandFamilyTV @hallmarkmovie We might need to co-host it together, or be the only two guests for the whole 2 hours- LOL
@NancyProvenzan1 I’d love that! #AuroraTeagarden
@anistonlopez I don’t. Aurora’s style is definitely different than mine. I’m much more similar to DJ Tanner’s style ;)
I know!!! - I’d move if I were her!!! #AuroraTeagarden https://t.co/A9bc6oq0s8

@AnimationBoy007 @ruthhill74 @ellieharvie She’s the BEST!
@JonathanFarris0 3 weeks of filming. Months of prep and post.

@RdMajors515 @yannick_bisson Ooohhh!! They did date a while back! Maybe they’ll rekindle something
@ann0311_martha @TheRealMarilu We’re not sure. I don’t think Aurora is over Martin yet.
@LexaDoig The WORST- and it’s super funny. #RoeandSallyShow
@TheRealMarilu @P_JBenson That made me laugh!!!!! So true, I remember we couldn’t stop laughing about it during filming
I think this is the question of the night! We love Aurora and Martin together- unfortunately Yannick chose not to return to the series. @yannick_bisson come back! https://t.co/NnE8EIaqZX
Arthur and Lizzy are married in really life ;) #AuroraTeagarden @P_JBenson
@NiallMatterFan @gleedemifan01 @niallmatter @TheRealMarilu @LexaDoig @hallmarkmovie Niall is actually in the NEXT movie, not this one! @hallmarkmovie mixed up the movie posters
@Qrtr4Thoughts Me too!!! And I LOVE working with @P_JBenson - we laugh SO much. #AuroraTeagarden
@HolsombackDiane Unfortunately, Yannick decided not to return to our series. Boo. But keep watching, I think you’ll still love whats to come
@tlselle72 @yannick_bisson I agree! They were cute together
@colleenlaffey @hallmarkmovie We all are :( #AuroraTeagarden
@RyanBartholomee @hallmarkmovie hopefully not quickly (although a few I guessed right quite early) but most of them I really don’t know until the end!
@sweetmisslisss One more after this one for sure!
#AuroraTeagarden  Any guesses who did it yet?
@heitmeyernancy @hallmarkmovie @ruthhill74 @TheRealMarilu @LexaDoig @P_JBenson I know ;( Tell @yannick_bisson he should come back
@MickeySharp7 @hallmarkmovie @TheRealMarilu Roe is always getting in the way and solves everything before Arthur! I think he’s tired of it- LOL
@JamieCosley Wow!! That’s so cool Thank you :)
@SaaSyStacy @yannick_bisson AGREED!!!
@LexaDoig XOXOXOXO
@jackster_93 @hallmarkmovie Thanks- however, I think my hair looks like a hot mess in this movie ;) #AuroraTeagarden
Whoo HOO!! @LexaDoig is on too!!!! #AuroraTeagarden https://t.co/K4V1odEf2f
Never!! Aurora is always so in control. https://t.co/WTWvVcTXs3

@LolaLariscy LOL- agreed!
@MetacarolineR Our producer @jimheadjr
@maryteachesmath @Downy @hallmarkmovie yay! Glad you love them
We can only hope! But no, Yannick decided not to return to our series. :( We miss him dearly and wished Aurora and Martin could have gotten married! https://t.co/hQKwq71Jbm
@TFedena Marilu for sure!
@annawilson06 me too :(

I found myself in both characters. My personality is more like Chris, but I have Kate’s workaholic tendency ;) #SwitchedForChristmas https://t.co/nPmpgIqOia

@camcdear @MargaretHaraga crazy, right?! Lots of great technology and several different camera shots!
@aydree_swyers @MargaretHaraga Yes! We had a great costume designer, but I always have an opinion :)
@oncerfan01 wonderful. A sweetheart. So is @MarkDeklin
Challenging and great! Yes, doing the twinning scenes were complicated and extensive but worth it! #SwitchedForChristmas https://t.co/MbiElHFFrV
@MarkDeklin GREAT job Mark!!!! I loved Chris and Greg together ;)
Are you #SwitchedforChristmas ? I’m back online tweeting with the west coast!

I think Chris and Greg are SOOOOO cute together!!! #SwitchedforChristmas
I love working with my daughter @natashabure ! She was great and I was so happy to have my baby with me #SwitchedforChristmas
@RyanBartholomee @hallmarkchannel no, I haven’t. I want to!
@kstaylor I’m not sure!
Who’s doing that Hallmark drinking game that went around? LOL- the obligatory baking and food fight scene #SwitchedforChristmas
Yikes!!!!!! Chris might get caught!! #SwitchedforChristmas
Isn’t @natashabure doing a great job?! And so is the boy who plays my son, his real name is Cooper. So cute!! #SwitchedforChristmas
Which couple are you rooting for more? Chris and Greg or Kate and Tom? #SwitchedForChristmas
What are you guys thinking so far? Liking #switchedforchristmas ?

Who has a twin in real life? #SwitchedForChristmas
I’m trying to answer some questions but they are coming SO fast!!!!! I can’t even read them! Thank you! #SwitchedforChristmas
I’m probably more like Chris, but I had an easier time playing Kate. Does that make sense? #SwitchedforChristmas
the hardest part playing twins was learning SO much dialog for the scenes with each other &amp; the rhythm #SwitchedforChristmas
It got quite confusing at times acting with myself ;) #SwitchedforChristmas
Tell me who you like better… Kate or Chris! #SwitchedforChristmas
there are SO many tweets I can’t even click them fast enough to comment! #SwitchedforChristmas
