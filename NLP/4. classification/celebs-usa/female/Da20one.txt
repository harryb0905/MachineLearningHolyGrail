I really have a love jones for this thing called Life. Whenever I think I can’t love it anymore, it up and blesses me. Unreal
I take timeouts when the game does but I’ll be back when the action is back. Question: should I live the stream going or it’s cool that I leave and come back? What’s easier for y’all?

I don't have a dog in the fight. I just don't want anymore blowouts. https://t.co/WfgH9k6INB
Things always get critiqued when you lose. Cavs dance every game during the warmups &amp; stuff but since they lost, now they were goofing off
How much did that $1,000 bring in? https://t.co/iv4SgT8BJ9

@tcardoza23 oh hey. Don't mind me. I'm just bragging about you.

@TTTRiga @EuroCupWomen where is the women's game? Mine is showing soccer https://t.co/DNjJv2xJML
@RealTr3y lol I'm curious this answer
Not a chance I'm changing the channel tho. Steph, Klay and Kd could make 17 threes in a row easily. They always have a chance
Now I know I'm country but never heard that saying before. https://t.co/e7BO1WopQC
I didn't fully believe it at first but The Warriors really are the new villains. How is that possible with a guy like Steph on the team tho? https://t.co/x1dXxN6JUL
The emphasis for the refs this year must be to not call fouls when players kick their legs out. Steph got those calls last year
@KedowWalker @bmoe_careful his reputation is getting the best of him
@Oprah that show is legit. I love it
All facts. Pop ain't with the games and musicals https://t.co/TYcdR1krVX
The Spurs must not have gotten the memo about that super team... This game is fun to watch

@RebeccaLobo @DishNSwish @LaChinaRobinson are already intense so I meant it's unfortunate we can't see both at full force. But 7 is too many
@RebeccaLobo @DishNSwish @LaChinaRobinson yeah, that's def not a good idea. Im just speaking as the fan I am, these single elimination games
@DishNSwish @LaChinaRobinson @RebeccaLobo I understand the rule. It's just really unfortunate that she's out in a single game elimination.
@AtlantaDream @tiphayes3 happy birthday Kiara!!

Yeah the refs need to cut that out as well ... A little scuffle is ok. People are fighting to win a championship  https://t.co/LPRiIB8RQe
If the Refs are going to clearly let the playoffs be more physical then they need not call technical fouls so quickly.

Then coming from the perspective of being on her team I've watched @twin1532 shut down top players in this league. I'm really shocked.
