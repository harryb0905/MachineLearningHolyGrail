@VictoriaBatezel The hurt we feel watching a parent suffer. No words can describe. She is at peace now and always watching over you. It’s going to be a long road for us but hopefully the good memories keep us going. My condolences love.
@maggiejbl I’m so sorry for your loss. I feel for u more than u know. I lost my mom 4 months ago &amp; watched her struggle 4 4yrs. We took care of her at home. Find some peace in knowing she isn’t in pain anymore. Have faith u will make it through. Cyber hug &amp; kiss 2u
@LennyGreen Of course my dear friend. I talk with him daily....

Love is a unconditional commitment to an imperfect person. To love somebody isn’t just a strong feeling. It’s a decision and a promise. Love with your whole heart! Happy Valentine’s Day my loves 💗
@bornrichceo 👀I’ve been working in silence. Everything doesn’t need to be televised. My vision is almost done and I couldn’t be prouder of my full body of work. Thank you for supporting a sista💁🏽‍♀️
When you love what you do, it really does not feel like work. Finishing up mixing my album and single/album photo shoots. I wake up motivated af. Thank you Jesus that I live my dream job everyday.
@instagram @RaeHolliday Man my numbers were dropping and I was like what the heck is Wrong with my IG. I was at 493k and now it’s at 388k Fix it jesus🤦🏽‍♀️

@jemelehill My thoughts exactly 😒How sway??? They arrested him in 2014...if he was illegal I guarantee he would have been outa here from them. Bizarre af
Don’t raise your voice, improve your argument.
I’m so in my element when I’m in the studio. Mixing the 1st single off my album and this joint is hittin like Tyson 😩👊🏽 I’m finna rattle y’all speakers! #JoinMe coming soon 🔊
@SoftEssence Yes I hear that a lot too. Unfortunately there are fakes. So when I don’t give money,I give food. I’m going to start carrying blankets in my car so if I see someone cold I can offer that as well. Any small gesture is appreciated. But yes at least our hearts will be at peace 🤗
@GurlSagittarius Respect is what everyone deserves. That small gesture of even saying I’m sorry I’m can’t help..u still acknowledge them. Most of us with good open hearts wish we could help everyone 😩
Martin Luther King Jr was a bridge builder not a wall builder. Today we still see racial segregation and are still fighting for equality. A man way ahead of his time who still inspires us all. We have got to be better.
This is so heartbreaking. Especially in the times we are in now. People need 2be more kind &amp; loving. Everyone needs/needed a helping hand at some point in some way. God bless his soul. I read he passed away &amp; would have been 68. Ronald Davis you aren’t forgotten. Love one another https://t.co/AXyC8s35XJ
Blessed are those who believe without seeing. Blessed are those who push forward no matter the circumstances. Blessed are those who know their worth. Blessed are those who take the limits off themselves. Blessed are those who know God created them with purpose. Be blessed.
Let me remind u, u haven’t come this far 2melt in fear. U haven’t come out of darkness 2live in the shadows. But 2live in the light. Don’t think for one moment u aren’t well equipped 4the battle. U have everything u need 2 thrive. Take a deep breath of relief. U are ready 2go!

@MissyElliott So well deserved! Nobody writes hits like you mama 🤗They better keep giving you all your flowers!!!!! I’ma need us to write a few more joints together too🤷🏽‍♀️😭
To all who need this, say this prayer with me ; Lord, I may not like my situation right now and things may be uncomfortable. But through my pain I know you will promote me. Help me to not be negative and remember I am blessed. Things will get better &amp; I will move forward. Amen
I’m watching this interview right now on @TheEllenShow and @KevinHart4real is so authentic &amp; open. He’s always spoken so well &amp; I’m glad she gave him the platform to speak his mind with no interruptions. I’ve always been a huge supporter of him and this further seals the deal. https://t.co/keuQRWHuSU
Heavenly Father, thank You for today! Thank You that I have another chance to come back to You, to help others, and to use the time that I receive from You well. I pray that You would guide me every moment of today and the future. Amen.
Happy New Year everyone! May your year be filled with more positive than negative. More love than hate. More yes’s &amp; less no’s. And less trips to the hospital &amp; more trips to the bank. 🥳 https://t.co/ZOocS7Vks7
Shiiiieeet me too! Sometimes people tell you and promise you things, so you move in good faith on their behalf, but then they never keep their word. Just gotta roll with the punches and carry on. https://t.co/MtKgbQSHtw
It doesn’t feel like Christmas Eve for me. My father is at the Mausoleum visiting my moms vessel and just text me how much he misses his wife. I hurt for him in many ways. I pray you are all grateful for everything/everyone you have this season.🙏🏽
When your bra and underwear match I swear you feel better about life 😩 I’m out here walking with that extra bop cause I’m matching underneath 🤣
Know the difference between burning a bridge and clearing a path...
I have seen harsher &amp; more proper judgement on a episode of Law &amp; Order SUV. I am so hurt for the victim to not get justice after this monster raped her repeatedly. Our system is totally screwed. God help us all. https://t.co/Lsrkpw2qDB
@realtorchic2 Oh wow. You are a trooper my love. Keep pushing. I’m going to be praying for you tonight 🙏🏽
This is the video I was telling you guys about that I saw on news this morning. Fukin out of line! These cops need more than training. They need Jesus &amp; for someone to do them like this. https://t.co/9v6lhJNhB3
Sending love &amp; positivity out to you guys. We are all going through our own issues. But everyone needs love. The world has become a horribly bitter place. But I pray for better days for us all. Be safe out there &amp; make someone smile today.
She’s continually yelling they are hurting my baby. All because someone called cops on her for disorderly conduct/obstructing hallway while she was trying to get assistance for her &amp; child. Cops now are the worst kind of evil. I’m convinced there are only 10% good cops left
So I just came in from my workout &amp; turn on HLN news. The video they just showed ruined my entire thought process for the day! 4cops wrestling with a black woman holding her 1yr old on the floor. Looks like they tryna rip her child out her arms &amp; tugging hard on woman..
@Milisahoades2 I’m watching now too. This poor lady &amp; sister😩😩😩they were living in hell. I just can’t
@darkchinaz Lmao that’s teeew much! You need a time out😩
@4thplanet @DiscoveryID It’s so addictive right😩
@pisceschic_91 Lmao no I’m an Aquarius 🤷🏽‍♀️🤣
I watch the ID channel way too much. This can’t be good for my psyche. I can’t be the only one hooked on this. I literally watch it every night when I get home. How I don’t have nightmares is beyond me😩
A thought can manifest into physical form. See the path you want to take and know you can get there. The road may be long and hard but never give up. See your vision through. You are a conqueror.
Your greatest ministry will most likely come out of your greatest hurt. I am learning to grow and glow in the dark!
You just do it. You force yourself to get up. Put one foot before the other and refuse to let it get to you. You fight. You cry. You curse. Then you go about your business of living. Push through.
She’s loved me from the moment she saw me. She saw all my hopes &amp; dreams begin to blossom. She taught me how to believe in myself. I became everything she hoped I would be. How grateful I am that regardless of time or distance, life or death, you will always be my mommy. https://t.co/5bd2VFuCzU
Good morning lovelies! Woke up in Disney 3 nights in a row 😍My family and I had a blast. You guys gotta go on the Hulk ride in Universals Island of Adventure. That was my favorite 🙌🏽 This trip really lifted my spirits. Thank you guys so much for all your love &amp; prayers❤️
I have a brighter fire inside of me since my Mother’s passing. I’m so sad without her but I’m going 2do my best 2push forward &amp; continue 2make her proud. You will live on through me. I Love you &amp; miss you mommy. Be grateful 4 what u have. Happy Thanksgiving guys🙏🏽
The only way to get through a storm is to look up, cry out for help, then take steps of faith even on the days you don't feel like it. God help me repair the broken pieces of my heart and life. I have so much 2b thankful 4 but still heavy hearted.
Dear Lord, thank u 4 a new day &amp; week ahead that is full of promise &amp; possibilities. Help me 2overcome any self defeating thoughts or habits. When I am tempted 2say “I can’t,” help me 2remember that u can &amp; I can do all things thru u. Give me strength 4 all that lies ahead. Amen
@kayslove31 That was beautifully said. Thank you so much
@AleshaRenee Lesh I never felt pain like this in my life. You know I am a woman of faith but this hits hard. Thank you baby
@LennyGreen Lenny, I thought losing my grandparents was worse enough. But the pain of losing a parent is far worse. I know you understand all too well. Thank you so much for being a dear friend all these years.❤️
Hey guys. I have been completely distraught &amp; heartbroken these past few weeks. My beautiful mom left this earth on October 9. Please keep me &amp; my family in your prayers. My dad was married to my mom for 40yrs. He misses his wife &amp; I miss my mom 🙏🏽Lord help us through
Ur blessing is coming. U are so close. Don’t buckle now. All those long nights &amp; early mornings. In school, at the gym, in the salon, in the studio, in the kitchen, on the movie set,in the boardroom, in the hospital. Ur next break is right around the corner. Ur next level.PUSH

@shaunking No words can take away/ease your families pain. Just know that I’m praying for your strength during this time and that your heart will heal. Taken too soon but I know his memory will live on through you. God bless you &amp; the family Shaun.
Give me one solid person/partner over 20 phonies any day! I don’t need a big circle, just a tight one.

@imraansiddiqi @shaunking How humiliating this must have been for this already scared and anxious beautiful young lady. I’m appalled and disgusted at the behavior of these TSA agents. This was absolutely absurd and I pray she can identify the 2 agents.

Remember, you are handpicked by God and nothing can change his love for you.
I’m just learning how to pray for my enemies/people who have wronged me &amp; I’m still a work in progress. @RealJohnGray is proof that God is working through him. He knew all the backlash he would get, yet he still went, even though his mind told him no. Don’t judge the messenger
I knew @RealJohnGray heart the 1st time I met him. I’m so disappointed in people for not seeing HIS bigger picture. GOD TOLD HIM 2do something &amp; he did it. Yes the majority of us loathe Trump, but someone has to be the bigger person 2speak for those without voices.

@ShaunKing Jesus help us all. We have got to find a way to get Donald out of office. This evilness starts at the top. His supporters love his hate &amp; have gotten beyond bold.His America is an abomination
Man of God, woman of God, you are a mighty warrior in Jesus! God is always with you, always fighting for you, &amp; always preparing you for victory. Though you may feel overwhelmed at times, the battle is never too big for you. May this be a year of great victory in your life.
Your hard work will pay off. The right people will show up. The moment you are ready to quit is usually the moment right before the miracle happens.

This is so terrible. Although I agree a punishment is warranted 4stealing, this young man is not the one who pulled out a gun. He should have gotten community service &amp; probation. He’s been in for 3yrs already. Smh anything to lock up colored kids😔 https://t.co/ooVGOZFoAZ
@Gabriel_Will1 Bruvvvv that shit was wayyyy too much smoke 😯
@AleshaRenee Buwahahaha I will do u one better &amp; send you a coat for the cold🤣🤣but not these candles lmfao sis my whole downstairs smells amaze balls right now
@AleshaRenee 🤣🤣Giirrrl the lilies and roses are my new fav!! The roses smell snexy😋my go to is the vanilla bean though. Man I’m being stingy with these boo🙅🏽‍♀️🕯
Just got home &amp; couldn’t wait to open my package from my favorite candles @DWHomeCandles 😍😍Thank you so much guys. My house smells amazing any time I use these. Can’t wait to try this new collection #Stop&amp;Smell https://t.co/Z9SuOuiltD
@ShaunKing Exactly!!! She’s shown her true color before. I don’t know why they gave her a reboot in the first place. We have enough racism going on &amp; sure don’t need to see more of it on that show. @ABCNetwork finally got something right.
Roseanne Barr needs to get down to @Starbucks ASAP and join the “Anti Bias” training. That was so blatantly racist and degrading. @ABC should be ashamed to have her on this network
🙌🏽Praise God from whom all blessings flow! Such a great deed and so deserving of a greater reward. https://t.co/y3ZK1C6cs3
It doesn’t matter how over saturated the market is. If God called you to it, there’s room for you.
@SikhProf Oh absolutely! But we live in terrible times under a racist government rule &amp; it causes us to point out race &amp; religion. It’s so unfortunate that people of color &amp; “different religions” are looked at as harmful when all we do is try to help &amp; empower others. Love to u also♥️
THIS IS UTTERLY AMAZING!! But this headline should read “Brave man saves baby from falling from balcony”. It shouldn’t be about his race/religion. God bless his agility. Wow just wow https://t.co/FRm4lv44H0
😩😩Still proud of my squad but got damnit I missed Kyrie out there!!! Great season nonetheless @celtics 🙌🏽 but can we talk about how Lebron balled out tonight👀🤦🏽‍♀️one man team! Sheesh 🐐
Sweetbaby Jesus don’t let the @celtics fail me now🙏🏽 👀
Sometimes you gotta fall apart, lose the person you thought you loved, watch your friends turn into foes, just to get to where you’re going. Trust the process. Elevation requires separation.
You just have to say to yourself “I’m not willing to accept anything less for myself than what I deserve.I am smart, I am beautiful, I am a good person &amp; I deserve to be happy”.
A lot of them lack common sense clearly!!!!! It’s so disgusting cause it all stems from the top. https://t.co/c0M7MweOxZ
More tears😩But thank God these are happy ones! Kids don’t see in “black &amp; white” you are taught to hate, you are taught racism. God bless this little boys parents and grandparents ♥️ https://t.co/xnVPgWokme
I’m literally in tears after watching this! All these officers are disgusting &amp; a disgrace 2 any uniform. You curse in her face &amp; push &amp; pull her 4 a traffic stop? None of the other officers saw anything wrong with this? My heart aches for this grandmother. I have no more words https://t.co/u3LBEca643

@ShaunKing @WaffleHouse I’ve eaten at a Waffle House 1 time at 2am after a performance.I didn’t like the food &amp; this seals the deal of ever going back. Racist, degrading place with horrible employees &amp; clearly corporations. Not to mention that the majority of these cops are evil &amp; a disgrace

So these 2 black men are realtors &amp; we’re just waiting at @Starbucks 4their friend 2show up &amp; that’s why they were arrested? Waiting while black? This gotta be a late April fools Prank?

Again, media &amp; people in general love to praise people when they are up, &amp; bash them when they are down! Shameful. Nobody is perfect.
See you guys put @OBJ_3 on such a pedestal that he's not allowed to miss a few passes? Come on man stop. He's only human. Off day or not.
I'm not even gon front. Watching @FirstTake as always &amp; they don't gotta press the Giants this hard😩but @maxkellerman beard &amp; 🕶 Lit Af
If it's meant for you, you won't have to beg for it. You will never have to sacrifice your dignity for your destiny.

A man doesn't need to be perfect to make a woman happy. All he needs to do is be the man he said he was when he first met her.
It's impossible 2 please God w/out faith because the 1 who draws near 2him must believe that he exists &amp; that he rewards people who seek him

Life is so much better when people don't know what you're up to. Everyone is ya business with an opinion. Don't tell, they won't inquire!
Forgiveness is such a simple word, but it's so hard to forgive someone when you have been deeply hurt. Give me strength lord😞
Sorry is nothing, the real apology comes when you can look in their eyes and see they hurt themselves just as much...

Sexism, racism,bigotry, hate,all won. But we as a unit have to hold each other 2gether. This proves how far we truly have not come.
I am utterly shocked and disgusted at the new president. I pray for the children who grow up seeing this as a representation of us😔
I woke up with tears in my eyes for this world we live in. I couldn't have been more proud of the family that graced us &amp; ran our country.
IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS CLOSE! I am truly ashamed.
I personally cannot wait for this election to be over so I can stop hearing the words "divisive" &amp; "bigly" 😩 #ImWithHer

Lmao easy Michael😂 I like Bron Bron, I'm just saying.We expect him 2b great,cuz he is. https://t.co/bkMqfo4lod
This is the first time I'm ever going to agree with Skip. "Lebron should have scored 41". Iggy out, Bogut out &amp; refs were pure shit✌🏽️
Tuned into my favorite show to see all the smack they Finna talk 😩 @FirstTake
Aight no one can deny that Lebron balled all the way Tf out but damnit these refs are horrible! The officiating was bullshit period.
So bron bron just gon look back at curry like that..ok we see u😩. https://t.co/1UYiBvjkI5

Don't be afraid of your fears. They're not there to scare you. They're there to let u know that something/someone is worth it.
Over thinking ruins you. It twists things around, makes you worry &amp; just makes everything much worse than it actually is. Just let it be

I knew they was finna pull this out🙌🏽 My pressure was up during the game. I called it..Cavs Vs GS
This teeeew much pressure. GS got me cussin at tv in 2 different languages https://t.co/KLMcuBuy5r
I'm so ready for game 7👀 *Does birdman hand clap*both teams outstanding but I'm sticking with GS for the win at home.
I want food, cuddles, attention and exercise. I'm basically a puppy🤔😭
Remember those who served. All gave some, some gave all. https://t.co/ULSLoNLp7X
You can't make someone be ready for what you're ready for, and you're not obligated to wait around for them to make up their mind.
If you wait and don't settle, you're going to get everything God has for you. The key is knowing what you want.
If he doesn't make you feel like u want 2 kiss him &amp; punch him in the throat at the same damn time, then he's not the one 😩😭
Stop hanging out with folks who got the tea, &amp; align yourself with folks who got the juice. Your network often determines your net worth👌🏽
That's the exact line I sung too lmfao https://t.co/eJ0k3RxL6Q
If the Warriors lose this 20pt lead in the 4th, Ima be highly perturbed.
Idc what y'all say, everytime they close up on Klay after making a shot, I start singing a Jon B song 😩😭 #GSWvsOKC
I know you are tired. I know you are physically and emotionally drained. But you have to keep going.
Stay in faith. God will move you towards your destiny. He will pay you back double for that terrible situation
So ready for this Okc vs GS matchup.&amp; some of y'all told me they wasn't gon play eachother😴 Tuh I know what I'm talkin bout damnit.
Thank you lord for every great opportunity you have waiting for me🙏🏽
When ya woo woo woooooh😩  https://t.co/JI7D9jk6wC
Closing deals at 1am seems pretty dope to me 🍾 @TonyDofat https://t.co/v0UIUC0HlK
When God lets things affect you emotionally, seize the moment and view it as an opportunity to step into a place of absolute trust in God.
Everything doesn't need recognition, especially if it's pure &amp; from the heart.
Thoroughly enjoying @lecrae interview on @FirstTake right now.
It was always a pleasure when I saw/Spoke w/Papa Wemba.Congo has grown very dear 2me &amp; they have lost a music legend, as he's laid 2rest 2dy
Success in life comes when you simply refuse 2 give up, with goals so strong that obstacles, failure &amp; loss only act as motivation.

Idc how many times I've watched "The Notebook" I still cry like a snotty nosed kid every time 😫😭#IBeLookinLikeRoscoeOnMartin #ImSensitive😪
Sometimes the most powerful thing to be is underestimated....
Faith is praising God in the storm. Trusting him in the valley, following him in the darkness. Trust your vision &amp;  trust God 2c it thru
How u start is not important how u finish is what matters. The odds may be against you, but the most high God is for you.
S/O 2the old white man that told me if he was 50yrs younger he'd scoop me up &amp; take me on his vacay w/ him😩 #AirportChronicles #It2Early4Dis
Although I know my Celtics aren't going to win it all, I'm just glad they in the playoffs🤔 I'm calling OKCvsGS in the end
God does not always deliver us from everything when we think he should, but he is always with us..so trust Him 2walk w/u thru the process.
Utter shock in hearing the news about the icon known as "Prince". He will always be an influence in music period &amp; will be genuinely missed
Put a little faith in a big God, and you’ll get big results.
I am happy with who I am, even though I am not where I want 2be. I am fine 2enjoy where I am while I'm in the process of being changed.🙏🏽
Peyton went out with a W...and it's only right Kobe does too. Sheesh what a night! #60 #KobeDay
WOW! Even I'm in awe tonight😳 #KobeDay what a way to go out #Salute
If ur a couple &amp; she prays for u, u better keep her. She's not just worried about your flesh, she's looking out for your soul.
Face ur fears.If u wait 4perfect conditions,you'll never get anything done!God doesn't expect us 2b perfect,but he expects us 2keep trying
Be thankful 4 ur trials. If you're being tested, you're being perfected. Which means u have a divine purpose and reason to rejoice!
The journey may suck but that's what makes you appreciate the destination.
Watching @FirstTake &amp; Skip Bayless facial expressions are always priceless when he's hearing Stephen A out.🤔😒🙄

People have to pretend you're a bad person so they don't feel guilty about the things they did to you....
Sometimes people who don't socialize much aren't actually anti social, they just have no tolerance to drama &amp; fake people.

Every painful thing is developing you. Difficulties are a part of life. You are not weak you are well able.

What you are praying for is way too small, God is going to supersede your prayers
You are full of God-given potential, &amp; He wants to do more through your life than you could ever imagine, but it requires your cooperation.
Be grateful for the good times &amp; keep the faith during the bad times. Stay positive when life gives you every reason to be negative.

Have faith in your journey. Everything had 2 happen exactly as it did to get you where you're going next.
Intimacy is not just who you let touch you. Intimacy is who you text at 3am about your dreams &amp; fears.
You may not always end up where you thought you were going but God will place you where you are meant to be.

Have you ever noticed that people would rather stop speaking to you instead of apologizing when they are wrong? Fukin meatballs
Your best stories will come from your struggles. The seeds of your successes are in your failures. Keep standing...The seasons change.

God rewards the faithful who amid their circumstances continued to believe in his wisdom,mercy &amp; power instead of questioning his reasons.
No need to envy anyone because what they have is not for you. And what is coming your way is not for them. Wait for yours!

Genuine people don't come around too often. If you find somebody real enough to stay true, keep them close.
Work on improving what you have &amp; what God has already given you while ur waiting
It's easy 2 have faith in urself &amp; have discipline when ur a winner, when ur #1.What u got 2 have is faith &amp; discipline when ur not a winner
Uncommon achievers are different. In a doubting world,they believe.In a slow world,they run. In a quitting world they persevere.
Let your hope keep you joyful, be patient in your troubles,and pray at all times.
