“Defeating ISIS” is a steady theme in all the letters. We have not defeated them - far from it. They continue to win bc their ideology still can persuade/recruit globally. Winning/defeating means puncturing narrative, reducing recruits, securing Gen Z. This is bigger than ISIS. https://t.co/AI8SfWgHeZ

#Norway Desk @StateDept should give @DHSgov a briefing book. Inter-agency doesn't always work well, but this seems like an easy win.
Just curious, do we no longer have notetakers in WH meetings? @DHSgov Secretary doesn't recall what @POTUS said. Usually, every word a president says is carefully documented to ensure his/her staff (or Cabinet members) can execute on views. https://t.co/sNWOpVRWMA

This is worth re-reading in light of POTUS word choice/sentiments, yesterday. Via @TheAtlantic re #Norweigan terrorist and word choice: In the manifesto, Breivik writes that Oslo Muslims "have transformed my beloved Oslo into a multicultural shithole.” https://t.co/W08SJgVs6a

@AliVelshi @WajahatAli With respect, it is not just what you say but what you do. Reps of our great nation must not just call out racism but stop allowing it to thrive.

Speaking of sending messages/defeating terrorism: #ISIS recruits using #UsVThem. Of all kinds. When USG, esp public presidential statements, favors certain races, religions, ethnicities etc... US is helping #ISIS + others. #Norway #Haiti #Africa WH remarks today are dangerous. https://t.co/XtBFp4iOco
