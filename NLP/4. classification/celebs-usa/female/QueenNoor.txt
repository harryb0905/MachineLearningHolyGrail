“[With] laser focus on women, the Noor Al Hussein Foundation rapidly became a source of best practice models and training and capacity building in over 20 countries throughout Western Asia.” #FFA2018
“I would encourage all of you through the means you have to find opportunities to support, mentor, and train this next generation because in the decades to come we will increasingly rely upon them to tackle the issues we face and, they are ready and waiting.”
“I know that this is a conference on #agriculture but we have all heard the phrase “give a man a fish, feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime.” In my experience, the saying should be “teach a woman to fish, or to farm, and everybody eats”.”
“Women farmers produce 60 to 80 percent of the food in most developing countries and, globally, are the main producers of the some of our staple crops…”#FFA2018
"The King Hussein Foundation has been acting as a disruptive, innovative force for young people, especially from underserved communities in education, economic empowerment and entrepreneurship as well as community service and cross-cultural understanding."
#MarchForOurLives as a proud member of a previous activist generation (1960s-70s) I am so heartened by another generation who have enough faith in themselves and their country to know that they can make it better. Bravo!
