Things I fortunately was not asked to explain: Rosie O'Donnell, Sean Hannity, and Howard Stern. #debate #watch #students #Cambodia

My informal poll of watching debate w a group college students in #Cambodia: Clinton overwhelming winner. Citing: #temperament #experience
After spending a week in #Cambodia - HRC is correct: people around the world following closely/want to know what results will mean for them.
