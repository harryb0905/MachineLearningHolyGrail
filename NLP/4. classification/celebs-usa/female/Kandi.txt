I’m cracking up that some of y’all are questioning Riley’s age. She’s 15. She will be 16 August 2018. She’s grown up on #RHOA.
@prettyboyww you clearly don’t watch the show if you posted that
She was trying to hold her tears until she was away from the camera. That’s why she cried when she got in the house. We were still mic’d so they played it anyway. https://t.co/ckqAh63eCN
@KVNGBALOR she’ll be 16 August 2018.
@_MOEtivation i couldn’t have said it better! Thanks
I’m happy the girls went to Houston but just because I didn’t go doesn’t mean I didn’t give. I gave 10k before I even knew the girls were going &amp; I gave another 11k to women affected by the Hurricane. I have a very giving heart.
Thanks for reminding everyone @_3nia3. https://t.co/s4vbWM0D9n
@Magnificentmom1 i gave money to help the people in Houston before any of the girls put together anything. Just because I didn’t go with Porsha doesn’t mean I’m not charitable.
