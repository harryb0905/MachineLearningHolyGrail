Dear @RawStory - This headline is a reckless LIE. My comments were a transition to Hillary topic and the tape proves that. #truthWinsAlways
Truth: I defended the Muslim student who made the clock and got arrested. Sad how that "writer" aims to mischaracterize me. #truthWinsAlways
John 8:32  and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free
This headline is a LIE. I never said what it claims. I was transitioning to topic on Hillary saying  she is "real"  http://t.co/nCGpkfusZr

And...preventative surgeries are still considered "elective"in most cases  correct? So: no insurance coverage = not an option for many...
Would you have preventative double mastectomy if you had strong family history (high risk) but not the genes they test for? Would you wait?

So... Bubbles is floating in my kitchen by the spice rack until we come to a decision.  #rebound pet seems to be a unifying theme. Thoughts?
Kids could not agree how to handle dead bubbles. "Too icy "to bury. "Too disgusting" to flush. "Too sad" to look at him or move him yet.
#family policy : they can always get #truth from us.  so we  told them. Bubbles died ... I am sad.it is ok 2b sad. All reacted differently.
Thanks @NrsJocie - it was a beta :(
Our #pet fish "Bubbles" is not moving.  Floating.   In 5.5 hours kids will be up and will feed "Bubbles", and find out. #advice ? ? ?

Five questions to consider before training for a marathon: http://t.co/KEGjFyEI @TeamRWB
Prepping for my appearance on @DrOz to talk about being #GlutenFree with my partners @GlutenFreely. http://t.co/URVyiCUe
Why women are split on #Romney and President @BarackObama http://t.co/ncV0wntb #election2012
I guess I am wrong to expect the leader of the free world to be  air-tight  when it comes to security of money. Is that asking too much?
why does @MittRomney ask donors to give CVV code to ensure secure, legal donations yet  President @BarackObama never asks. #IsThatLegal?
#expectMoreFromThePresident #focusOnEcomomyNotBigBird #awkward #Desperate
big bird not happy @BarackObama "Sesame Street asked President Obama's campaign to take down its latest attack ad against Mitt Romney"
household income down.  federal deficit over 16 trillion dollars. &amp; the President's focus 28 days from election day is -Big Bird. #awkward

@InspiredMom824 amen
@MLee0910 then u r lucky
@joannek7 ha! Neither do I... Bit some liberals and ind's do
Both are good men. #Debate2012  but we need a great president. #It's not about liking Obama - It's about needing Romney
@joannamcneal  I know many people who feel peer pressure to star the same vote...It's not about liking Obama It's about needing romney
All I am saying is that you can let your friends assume- and keep your vote 2 urself if u feel peer pressure to vote Obama again.
It's not about LIKING @BarackObama Obama ( And I do) It's about NEEDING @MittRomney Romney ( and we all do) #Debate2012 #debate #Debate2012
Ok... How about we use secret ballot: just tell it friends u r voting for Obama and when u get there- vote #romney. #DoTheRightThing
23 million more out of work, 50% of college grads with no jobs opportunity. Debt doubled. #on who's clock #Debate2012 #debate

Anyone else in the "school picture protection program" this week? ( where u try to minimize injuries, scrapes, bumps before school pics?)
When summertime returns and i am chasing them to sun-stick their faces remind me to use them siting patiently  for facepainting as leverage.
@RachelWeintraub miss u!
ok @TiffanyGlamCEO guess which other family member was in the movie? Hint: belly
I have a love-hate relationship with kids' facepaint. Love that they are happy. Hate that their cheeks become stamps all over me and house.
@SherriEShepherd maybe after 1?

@jess_roland it is not ok
Hellooooo- I held the position that he should NOT be discriminated against based on weight!!!!! The scale remark was to show how ridiculous
If "christy" Christie were running and we said "she"was to fat, it would be sexist. Therefore-  It is not right to say it about a man.
It is wrong to assert that someone can't be president because of their weight. "we'll have a scale waiting" was a sarcastic throw.
I realize tonight that I actually hate vanilla ice cream. Really- If it is not chocolate: WHAT is the point. #wasteofcalories
Ordering online groceries, watching @hopesolo on #DWTS, reading bill o'reilley book, and prep for Vice Prez Biden interview - #strangecombo
