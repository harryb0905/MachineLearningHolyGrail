@hartluck and I have been lucky enough to ride through Ireland, Germany, Austria, Australia. It’d be hard to pick a favorite. I rode with my dad through the mountains in North Carolina and he rode behind me. He was nervous, lol, but he told me after that I was a really good rider https://t.co/RCIosJXuUX
Yes. I’ve been riding my own for 16 or so years now. I’ve had triumphs, Harley’s and Indian motorcycles and have ridden all over the world. I grew up on the back of my dads bike. First accident at 9 years old. It’s a passion in our family. https://t.co/4LQMNf7xZj

Rolling stone did an article tonight on concerts, and how moving forward, It’s all about the spectacle. I kindly disagree. It’s about the songs. It’s about music. Bells and whistles are extra, and awesome. You just have to be good.

I actually feel like we are all just celebrating who we are, and living out our memories from when that song happened, or just letting go of things we no longer need to hold on to. It feels like the best kind of party slash therapy. https://t.co/u7cZidbbyR

Hi my Sydney friends. It is with great frustration that I bring you this news:( Friday’s show will be postponed. I was hoping a couple of days of rest would help me kick this sick, but not at the speed I was hoping for. I appreciate your well wishes and understanding + I’m sorry.

Seriously can we bring back stories about nuns adopting rescue puppies? And Girl Scouts donating money to shelters?
I’ll clarify my “news” Comment before it becomes a blshit story. The current climate is that everything is bad. And a lot of it is. But there are so many beautiful people in this country who don’t subscribe to any of this horseshit. We all get along. We believe in decency.
Also(very important)my favorite part of the shows/crowds so far in America have been exactly what the news and social media don’t want you to believe; this/our world is diverse and beautiful. And you have all shown up, co-existing peacefully and even lovingly. We r better 2gether

I choose to remember last night as being a celebration of women, of Diana, of Whitney, of love and life and joy and all things good. THANKYOU to everyone that had the courage to take that stage- wether it be right side up or sideways. All love ❤️
Waking up to see a newly created riff between myself and another incredible woman, Christina, who took on an incredible feat, who I support fully, makes me so sad. You all perpetuate keeping women apart b/c you're afraid of the power we have when we get together.
Last night was about honoring first responders, singing with one of the greatest voices I have ever heard @kelly_clarkson, and pushing myself to do something I was afraid of and everyone thought was impossible. I scaled a building. While singing live.
No matter where I am, I always try to #ShopSmall! Like right now, I can't get enough of @MercedesVenice in Marina Del Ray - amazing food. This Saturday, Nov 25 show your neighborhood some love and #ShopSmall! #AmexAmbassador https://t.co/LKho8aYLEB

Anything about Demi Lovato or called out anyone. I was talking to a friend in response to his disappointment about the show. I agree w him.
You know, this is part of why I'm sad about the VMas and the world in general. Everyone is so nasty and waiting for a fight. I never said
