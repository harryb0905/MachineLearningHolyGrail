You know that song from bruno mars about how he thinks he wants to marry you? Someone should use that song to propose
Did I bring a brownie into the car? I did. And when I emerged half an hour later, I did so without the brownie. They know what time it is
The lunch line is in the parking lot, mere paces from my car. So 80 crew members could see me walk up to my parked car, climb into the backseat and close the door behind me. Could this be perceived as erratic behavior? Maybe
Catch me sleeping in my car on my lunch break
@breathnchlorine @banditochords tbh everyone’s mad about different things every day and I don’t see most of it. I don’t even clock most the stuff that comes up. But there are things that’re so insensitive towards stuff I do not joke about or take lightly bc shit y’all ain’t even know abt, it’s wrecked to me
@earthangeldebby @banditochords @breathnchlorine Wait disparaging towards trans but also towards rape??? And saying kys? Like in earnest, in 2019? Is actually really messed up, ty for bringing this to my attn
@banditochords @breathnchlorine What did she say? Nooooo it’s endlessly impossible to learn about anybody
@breathnchlorine Wait what? No way
@MelanieMaynard1 Same same. It can be so inspiring or deeply dehumanizing. I was so encouraged by the full range of size, color, sexuality and just types of beauty that challenge the societal norm...! I love what’s been happening in fashion &lt;3
You think anyone will be able to walk an awards show carpet after Cardi B did that 1995 Mugler archive to ‘em or

Chaos breeds chaos
People with a compulsion to destroy things attract destructive people.  Folks that like to poke holes &amp; stay bitter &amp; stir things up attract others that do.  Mean spirits find one another and get meaner and meaner together, til they’re mean against each other. Loyalty is gold

@sweetenerbenzo @Alyssa_Milano @MichaelProvost_ that’s riiiiiiiite keep speaking it
@Don_tTouchMe @RyanPops I’ve seen a lot of that support from their fans that watched the show and am so grateful. 🖤 People who appreciate and stan someone of that much character understand that he sees a full picture, and anyone that’s targeted and cruel to someone’s loved ones just don’t respect him.

@DVYDREVMING @HeyVioletUK I ship Patty and Nonnie endgame, said it before and I’ll say staying it. Except Patty’s been too selfish for real love historically and needs to sort her priorities, and Nonnie should be worshipped, but let’s all cross our fingers for the journey https://t.co/dC5YoqAtcK

there’s a point at which the makeup artists just don’t have time to conceal all my noise  you should see my wrists after the scene in back of the Weiner Taco truck, brutal https://t.co/trTBNQxjEP
@httpscrawford We’re both bad at staying quiet at what we perceive as injustice, we have a hard time forgetting when manipulative, insidious, fake or hurtful people get defended and celebrated, both have gotten “sheetfaced” to self-medicate, prefer sneakers to heels and are hungry for so much
@Meditatingkat_ So dark
@lmbueno4 Hahaha we literally show Patty bra shopping before her road trip to Alabama. A new bra is expensive okay and she already had to get new clothes for school, so she’s gonna wear her pretty new one whenever she thinks someone will see it?
Idk if you’ve noticed but Patty is impulsive and gets misguided 😇 Bob was the first dude to show her attention and she got that wayy twisted for a minute... of course Christian’s obsession with her feels good, empowering, collaborative even. I guess she never watched Heathers... https://t.co/MuDAVjvKcG

@brentsower WOW I wrote thrashed but I also cried and shouted like human garbage so
@tayraecrowe Awww angel bb. Wasn’t it the most healing night after the most heartachey day?
@brentsower Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.  You too! Glad to’ve trashed alongside you
Also the first album I ever bought myself was Wildflowers in a cracked CD case from a used bookstore and now he is gone. But music stays
Heal how you need to. Grieve how you need to. Process how you need to.  And when it’s all a lot, working to be okay is enough. Noble, even.
Go courageously into a scary world. Hold tenderness and leave it less scary. Don’t let fear pressure someone else’s words into your voice
It’s fair to feel devasted and daunted. Hope is super important. Desperately search for the loudest, healthiest version of light and be that
Okay bbs ily but c’mon Cowboys. What happened
