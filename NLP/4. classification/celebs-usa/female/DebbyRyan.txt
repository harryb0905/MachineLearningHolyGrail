@lmbueno4 Hahaha we literally show Patty bra shopping before her road trip to Alabama. A new bra is expensive okay and she already had to get new clothes for school, so she‚Äôs gonna wear her pretty new one whenever she thinks someone will see it?
Idk if you‚Äôve noticed but Patty is impulsive and gets misguided üòá Bob was the first dude to show her attention and she got that wayy twisted for a minute... of course Christian‚Äôs obsession with her feels good, empowering, collaborative even.
