As always, an honor to share the @NBCSports booth with @terrygannon83 , and to have a front row seat to some brilliant ice dance performances. Thank you, skaters!
@Adaripp @rockerskating Oksana Baiul: “My All”
1 of the best parts of my broadcasting career has been being welcomed into the @usacurl family. I know you loved watching these great athletes at the Olympics, now we can help them reach their next goal by visiting the following link. Every click counts: https://t.co/AEnlW0yxQZ
@CJVosters @JoeyCheek @ISU_Speed @CharlieaWhite @tarawellman @paulbronoly @TeamUSA @ItsKrystleT @kristiyamaguchi @Ben_Agosto @kaitlinurka Ben and I were there too! Sorry we missed you.
@PiperGilles @icedancecom Count my family in, if we can help!
@AshWagner2010 First commentary job, and @AshWagner2010 did it covering 3 disciplines AND working through the night to call it live 🙌 Can’t wait to share the broadcast booth with you!
@HRHtheDentist Great question, and one I should probably know the answer to...🤷‍♀️I’ll look into it. Thanks!
@KristiMac2014 @rockerskating Thank you! Ben brings out the best in everyone :)
@rockerskating Nothing better than a beautiful triple axel! Kulik &amp; Mura would make my list as well.

Thank you, @LynnRutherford , for the nice conversation! https://t.co/zS1ecTCBVe
@KerithBurke @est1930 @NBCSN @TeamUSA Haha! I love it👍 We’re destined to meet.
@MrT Same.... 😪

@rockerskating @Ben_Agosto @NBCOlympics @NBCSports 😂😂😂 Never enough for Liza
@bluffdweller @NBCOlympics @NBCSports Thanks Uncle Paul!!! Have a GREAT trip 😀

@ScottHamilton84 @liam_mchugh @NBCOlympics I’m already missing all of you! Thank you, Scott, for always providing an example for how to live gratefully, and with joy!
@MamaLinzD @ZARA @NBCSports Mac Retro Matte “Ruby Woo”😘

Closing ceremony complete! And with that, I say goodbye to one Games and hello to another. Paralympics, here I come 🎤@NBCOlympics @NBCSports
Recycling this photo with one very special update 🥇 ... CONGRATULATIONS @TeamShuster !!!! Gold looks good on all of you. @NBCOlympics #BestOfUS https://t.co/wLlknX58nh
@chriselam @NBCOlympics @NBCSports @terrygannon83 I miss seeing Ben every day, but I love this new role! Thank you for watching!
@TyberiusSays 🙋‍♀️
@williamward @ScottHamilton84 We were having trouble with the signal and our mics were dropping out 🤷‍♀️
@PhlowerGirl @ScottHamilton84 Thank you, Kimberly!
@rol411 Her coach told me she’s tried them in practice. Why not?!
@AnneofDunrobin The standard for clean turns and edges in step sequences has been raised significantly, as have the acrobatics in the lifts, not to mention the twizzles cover about twice as much ice as ours did!
@lpsrocks Thank you! @LeotaNewYork
@ms_b_history All my wrap and print dresses were provided by @LeotaNewYork Thank you for watching!
@icedancecom Thank you!!!
@AnnKCharles @Ben_Agosto So neat! Thank you very much for sharing!
@OhRingItOn @NBCOlympics Wow, thank you very much! I’m so glad you enjoyed our coverage of the events👍
@AlanLLee Well, Alan! Thank you and hope you’re doing great!
@KathleenALynn I guess I just couldn’t help myself!
@sarahgonyon I’ll miss it too! Thank you so much for watching ❤️
@megcopenhaver I’m sorry I got to this too late to remember what I was wearing but thank you!
@DensiLand @NBCOlympics Most were provided to me by @LeotaNewYork . Thank you!
@MichelleinWA I’m sorry I got to this too late to remember what I was wearing, but thank you!
@brenders_e I wish I knew! We have a great team of stylists working on us, thank goodness!
@remavineyard It depends on how much support staff they have at their home rink. Oftentimes there are 2-4 coaches helping to assist the head coach and training specific skills. There could easily be 10 teams to a coach, in that case.
@ChelleMoraga Sorry I didn’t get to this in time! When the videos are made available, Ilike review 👍
@itslisae @BrightCuPenny 😊🙋‍♀️❤️
@helenasmonster This means even more coming from a fellow Clone Club member 🙋‍♀️ Thank you!
@DMS721 @kwanfan1212 Tech panel replay cameras must have seen something we couldn’t... I couldn’t see it in real time either 🤷‍♀️
@_Wakabond I didn’t see it live either but the tech panel had a different view of things through the replay system, apparently.
@MiniCoopGuy @NBCOlympics @JohnnyGWeir @taralipinski I hear you, Brian. I’ll keep working on it. Thank you!
@JoAnnBarnas Thank you Jo-Ann!
@hkburkholer20 Noted! Will try to do better next time. Thank you for the feedback.

@WheelerHillary @ScottHamilton84 Scott is, as always, too kind but you’re right. Truthfully, I’m just as caught up listening to what he has to say as everyone watching! His passion for this sport is unrivaled. I’m sure we’ll both have plenty to say about ice dancing. I can’t wait!
@MrCollierC @ScottHamilton84 @liam_mchugh We’ll be previewing the event on #NBCOlympicIce on @NBCSports one hour before primetime!

@LisaLockman1 @ScottHamilton84 @NBCOlympics @terrygannon83 Unfortunately, Ashley wasn’t able to skate in the gala. It wasn’t the same without her charisma!
@DeclutterDiane Thank you for the feedback! I’ll definitely take this into consideration for the future.

@ScottHamilton84 @terrygannon83 @NBCOlympics Dream team!
@j9carlson Thanks! There always was a bit during SlLi but if you rewatch GPF FD for comparison, you will see they’ve added more from the chorus between StaLi and STw: “Lights will guide you home...I will try to fix you”.
@lynda722 Miss my Ice Desk family!
@logical_laura @NBCSN So glad you enjoyed the broadcast and thank you for the feedback! We’ll be back live on NBC for the FD 🤗
