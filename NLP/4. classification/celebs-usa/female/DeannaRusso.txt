@lapkus I... don’t know
Gave myself a bloody nose when my knee rammed my into my face. I was jumping between two beds at Circus Circus, wasted obviously.
I stabbed myself in the leg with a skinny metal knitting needle I had just purchased at Walmart because I stumbled into a doorway. The puncture was so deep that when I lifted my hands away, the bag of yarn they were in hung off my leg
A kid stepped on my hand with double-bladed ice skates when I put my hand down on the ice RIGHT IN FRONT of the gate to enter the rink... 7 stitches later...
I fell through a deck that was under construction. I was small enough that my whole body slipped through a missing plank but was stopped by my head/nose. I dangled by my bleeding face until my parents pulled me out.
I sealed my eyes shut by splattering hot wax at my face when I looked down to see something I knocked off a shelf land in a Glade candle that had been burning for HOURS. Dialed 911 blind... but was this “the most stupid”? [thread] https://t.co/IWtsOtHmDn

@mikestill Like I said, we encouraged people to donate to RAICES. Back when the crisis was first publicized. Now we are encouraging people to donate to smaller go fund me causes. Thank you for the opportunity to learn from one another.
@mikestill Thanks for the feedback, Mike.
@mikestill RAICES has $20million plus. I encourage you to do your research and look for smaller go fund me missions to help individuals.
@mikestill @DangerBrooks I can’t defend SWK by I do know they’ve been doing this for 30 years. I’m shocked to learn that they have unlicensed facilities. They’ve been the landing pad for kids for decades.
@mikestill It’s like doing service for prisoners. We don’t support the prisons to help the prisoners. If we want to criticize anyone it should be anyone with a law degree not in the trenches right now.
@mikestill It is a very complicated and sensitive situation. Morgan, Casey and I decided to treat it as emotional triage. SWK never asked for money. They said letters and drawings from other kids comfort them. We felt this validated their request. Teddy bears was Morgan’s idea.
We were 3 moms who needed to try something, Mike. And it worked to our own surprise. It’s not binary. It’s like cancer, hit it from all sides. This was the small impact we could make &amp; it brought attention from both sides of the aisle which is what this crisis needed. https://t.co/HZLorotTc0
You’re right and we did refer queries to RAICES and The Young Center. We never condoned SWK but they were our gatekeeper to the kids. We talked to social workers and learned this was something that could make the kids feel better now while we wait for the law to catch up. https://t.co/cftTwGZflk

@Jekklez1980 That’s a good point. The FBI’s role is to uphold criminal laws. Therefore we need laws that would prevent someone with such a huge warning from buying that type of weapon legally. Gun control would protect both children and responsible gun owners.
Guns can provide food for one’s family. They can also be an important tool for law enforcement. Other than that, they are terrorist propaganda, and America is losing that war.

10.) That everyone at every level has to do them so there’s no escape.     Fin.
9.) I’m paranoid. Is anyone watching this $50 thing I paid for and worked on? Or is this file-sharing link going ignored? Or worse, what if the take I sent was so off-base that it’s now become something people laugh at  behind my back and pity me for still being in the game?
7.) Self-tapes send me down an existential crisis because what does it all mean anyway? There is no point to any of this...  8.) I’m much better in the room. LOOK HOW MUCH FUN I AM.
6c.) Omg actors are neurotic enough as it is.  Don’t make us decide. Our health insurance eligibility depends on it.
6b.) Self-tapes, on the other hand, are a lot of guess work. Do you send the version that’s too broad but the first line is strong or send the take that starts out slow but ends exactly how you had it in your mind?
6a.) Self-tapes are a vacuum. Every project has its own unique tone, and when you work with the person who was hired to find that tone, it makes all the difference.
5b.) And it’s gonna cause tension with your partner because you hate the way they give notes. And you can’t get drunk yet. And this happens every time you leave town. I mean, thanks for the opportunity.
5a.) Self-tapes fuck up your vacation. There’s nothing worse than leaving for a little break from the hustle only to hear, “Can you put yourself on tape before end of business day?” Now you gotta track down a printer and good WiFi.
4.) Self-tapes are all kinds of quality. I’ve submitted tape I filmed on my phone while talking to a prerecorded vocal track of myself saying the other lines. Versus going to a professional with good sound &amp; lighting &amp; you pray they’re a decent scene partner.
3.) Self-tapes are expensive. I like being married and self-tapes are a relationship-ender which means I get to shell out $50 per HALF hour for someone else to press record. That  collection of rejection adds up.
2.)  Self-tapes have become the new norm. The convenience of technology is undeniable and therefore expected.
I’ve been taping myself for auditions since 2004. Here’s why self-tape auditions have become a thing I resent.   1.) I’m lazy. Or, I come from a time before self-tapes existed.

Parent tip: If you think of toddlers as playing a new video game for their 1st time, then them running around testing boundaries is how they learn the rules of the world. It’s your job to be consistent physically and emotionally. 💫

An exec producer once told me in a meeting that women aren’t funny. I told him I hoped he’d die of AIDS. He was rattled by this. So I pointed out that if a man had said it he’d be laughing. Didn’t get that job. 🤔

@PiperChristeson @stu_corbett If you didn’t know hopper was a good guy, his behavior could be misconstrued
@PiperChristeson @stu_corbett Child grooming is establishing an emotional connection with a child to lower the child's inhibitions with the object of sexual abuse.
Thankfully Hopper turned out to not be a child molester but everything he did for Eleven was straight up grooming #StrangerThings2

@SkyVendor3 Recording my voice for a possible job. Other than that, taking my sick cat to the vet right now. You?
@SkyVendor3 You're not wrong about that
@SkyVendor3 Why don't you think everyone is horrible and wonderful? You believe there is only good and bad? That's ok I just want to understand.
@SkyVendor3 Thanks for your well wishes. I have everything I could have asked for and therefore no longer chasing. Thank you for the polite convo ❤️
@SkyVendor3 for the same thing you are looking for maybe. Which is accountability. Yes? If not please elaborate.
@SkyVendor3 But I don't know if anyone "easily complied" with anything. Nor do I think anyone is asking for sympathy. I think the victims are looking
@SkyVendor3 You're right that a lot of people knew and couldn't/didn't do anything to stop him. It's a nightmare.
@SkyVendor3 Oh I thought you were disagreeing with my quote about everyone being horrible and wonderful etc. my mistake. Thanks for clarifying
@SkyVendor3 And for the record, I won't agree to do anything for fame. That's what my original tweet was saying.
@SkyVendor3 You reached out to disagree with something that seems like common knowledge to me and for that reason I'd like to learn how you got there.
@SkyVendor3 That's not what I'm assuming. I'm genuinely curious to understand your viewpoint and have no intention of changing it.
@SkyVendor3 I'm failing to see what you mean. Walk me through it ❤️
@DangerBrooks Excuse me a second. https://t.co/xDgTi1q0Ww
@DangerBrooks Maybe he was assaulted tho

Feeling myself when the grocery guy called me miss until I watched him also call a senior citizen miss. Who am I kiddin I'm still feeling me
maybe the assholes would stop getting away with it.
I shouldn't have taken my shirt off. If every woman or man who was sexually harassed or sexually assaulted posted #metoo,
I called the director confused, he told me a million girls would kill to be in my position. He told me if I didn't want to be filmed topless
#metoo  I was filmed nude without knowledge or consent and didn't find out until watching it the movie on DVD (with one of my grandma's).

@TacitPatriot I'm pretty leftist and also very curious what you mean
@BasementThought Sorry about that, I am getting a lot more attention from people who don't follow me. Hi.
@BasementThought And I think we can both agree that shame is a nasty deterrent and it sucks that it prevents people from coming forward sooner.
@BasementThought No one covered up the scandal to keep anyone in govt in power. That's a pretty bold conspiracy theory. They hid it out of shame.
@BasementThought Dare we agree that the idea of having sex with a nasty pervert for work isn't actually a dem vs rep issue?
@DjLots3 @AnnCoulter Also it drew negative attention to my other liberal posts. But hey this should all be great for my star meter on IMDb, right hollywood? 🤢

@dannymoersdorf @Jackie_Blue_CA Um I just had a baby, dude. Relax.
@MDeVore304 If by my people you mean my twitter followers then I think that about all my tweets. Jk sorry this is serious. You're right tho.
Twitter was originally invented for traffic updates. Man is this shit so stupid now.
@jerrasic_ Yes there is a diff between celebrity and actor. I was reacting to being yelled at like I was a celebrity. I don't have to tell ya I'm not
@longshotranch I ask myself that all damn day
@jerrasic_ Anyone who works to feed their family is working class. But you're right I'm not technically WC. I'm on unemployment ❤️
@NotBrutonSmith Never underestimate the power of one tiny flame ❤️🔥❤️
@Jackie_Blue_CA Yes good point. I'm still living paycheck to paycheck tho. Most actors do. Wish I weren't!
@BasedMonitored Jefferey Macintyre and he's not on twitter. I need to follow his lead on that.
@BuriedPipes @LiamMcIrishman @jllgraham You're absolutely right.
@Ma1973sk @TheDemocrats No one hid anything because of that tho. I promise. Victims hide assault because of much more awful reasons ❤️
@Jackie_Blue_CA @rikilindhome I feel the exact same way about Trump supporters. Maybe we should sit down and find out where we went wrong ❤️
@Ma1973sk Hey love you tweeted @ me so that's why I responded. I'm not the enemy. I was trying to make light of the discussion. And for that I'm sorry
@gina_chevy Both. It was said to me as a joke by a friend who loves to talk about sex. Made me sad. I take sad things and tweet them as jokes.
@Jackie_Blue_CA I'm literally on unemployment maybe that's why I'm for govt assistance ❤️
@NineLineMedevac @SalomeAnulisch I absolutely agree. I was never propositioned or else I'd like to think I would have blown a whistle. I said whistle right? Whistle.
@jerrasic_ (Loooong way off from that btw 😂)
@jerrasic_ Yeah man. I'm a mom trying to make ends meet. Until I have my own plane and doctor and island, I'm working class.
@Ma1973sk @TheDemocrats You're absolutely right that hollywood preys on young women. But to go from that fact to lining Weinstein pockets for Hillary is a stretch
I've never met Harvey nor do I know the woman he was talking about but I tweeted the joke because I was sad that it was even a thing (2/2)
The friend who gave me that awful advice is a gay dude who loves talking about sex &amp; claimed to know a woman who turned down Harvey (1/2)
@GoodFight4 lol you're not wrong
@obama_speech lol I wish snookie beat me up. I'm not even that famous.
@aerofile Lol
@Ma1973sk Heart breaking, yes. Please tell me, what exactly should I have done? Maybe this will stop all predatory men. Genuinely asking.
@Ma1973sk @TheDemocrats Do you believe 911 was an inside job?
@ScarlettLane You're not wrong
@jimhen68 @jllgraham Same ❤️
Most of us "Hollywood elite" moved here with nothing and a dream. We are the working class. If u don't like our opinions, change the channel
@LiamMcIrishman @jllgraham back in 2010 it was so I'm not surprised it turned out to be real. I'm glad it's getting attention now. That's how we do something about it
@jllgraham I'm not a celebrity nor have I "made it" in hollywood. This was one of those urban legends people joked about. Fucked up? Yes.
@Chet_Cannon It was a gross rumor. I didn't want to think it was real because that would discount the actresses' talent. What a monster 🤢

@Jeffmw Do you think having easier access to mental health and a more generous healthcare system would help?
@Jeffmw ...distance between an inch and a mile to find a safer middle ground. We need responsible gun owners to come forward &amp; say this.
@Jeffmw ..hands. Too many bad apples need more control unfortunately. I think NRA is worried giving an inch will mean a mile. But there's a great...
@Jeffmw Guns can provide food &amp; protection when in the right hands. But it's clear there's nothing currently stopping guns from being in the wrong..
@Jeffmw The one last week? That guy was stopped by being tackled. He accidentally shot himself with his own gun. Or did you mean a different one?
@Jeffmw Earnest Q: how many people do you know personally have had to use a gun to protect themselves? I ask out of curiosity &amp; want 2 understand
