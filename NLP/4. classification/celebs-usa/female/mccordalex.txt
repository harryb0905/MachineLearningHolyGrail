@MrsRuggeri Great point. What's the threshold? Is 2 months OK? Is 6? How about zero for the threshold, applied to everyone?
@lettuce43chat LOL, that wouldn't help. No matter where one actually lives, US citizens still have to pay taxes &amp; get to vote, etc etc.
@3912125 Of course he gets to choose when. However, if you look at the $$ raising rules, he bent them really, really far.

New episode of @TheRealDealAlex will air @The_Stir this afternoon (with a NEW camera &amp; microphone...yay!) Tell me if you hear a difference.
Johan danced down the street to the bus this morning singing "I'm Too Sexy for my shirt." Don't think I've heard that since the early 90s...
@Natefame @TheRealDealAlex did you see last fri TRD? I said the same; also talking about an experience I had pre-Simon ;-)
Gotta say, #catfishmtv was more interesting than ANY of the Housewives tonight. Did you watch?

@JOVANPAVIC Yet you tweeted me...what does that say about you, my friend? xo
@cocogeorgeson Lovey, you've never met me. Stop slinging mud online and go hug somebody, if you're brave enough. xox
@cocogeorgeson Well, that's 40 with no botox for you. I'd rather be real than fake, if you know what I mean! ;-P xo

@Leigh26Heather Normally I give her a kiss, commiserate and listen to her. Or do you mean on TV? ;-)
I have a funny feeling you're going to LAUGH when you see what I'm wearing in today's @TheRealDealAlex for @The_Stir...
@tjhaneckow Great question &amp; I'll address it in today's episode of @TheRealDealAlex - stay tuned!
@PrimaDonna001 @Bravotv Taking TRD to 5 days/wk has expanded my horizons! I recommend 19Kids, Catfish &amp;the naked manipulation by Kris Jenner
Since @SimonvanKempen ate all the muffins, I think he should make some more. What do you think?!?!
@tjhaneckow And you as well!! xx
@PrimaDonna001 @Bravotv Writing today's script as we speak. Including FOX's, erm, exciting "I Wanna Marry Harry." Did you hear about that??
@PrimaDonna001 You're wrong about that. We've built a successful business commenting on the back-end of all reality TV, no more, no less.
@tjhaneckow Disagree 100% -- using the former means it's a term that doesn't apply to the user. Can't say the same for the 2nd.
