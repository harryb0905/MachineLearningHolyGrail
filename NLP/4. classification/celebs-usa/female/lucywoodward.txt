I don’t normally tweet this stuff normally because of the condescending and full-of-hate commentary it brings. Why haven’t we moved forward? Nazi Youth gathering 1940’s, Woolworth’s 1950’s, Indigenous People’s March 2019. So incredibly heartbreaking. https://t.co/suvesviX5L
I hope this MAGA youth is proud of his actions. Looks like the same DNA a Nazi youth could’ve been made of. Grotesque, evil and atrocious. https://t.co/8lApnIlmDT
