@AmericanAir You still owe me for the hotel bill tonight. The only reason I'm staying in a hotel is that you ran out of fuel, caused us to depart over an hour late, made me miss a connecting flight, and then left me waiting in line and on hold while all subsequent flights tonight departed
Forgot to mention that during the time I waited in airport customer service line -- and also for @AmericanAir *phone* customer service line -- I missed multiple subsequent flights that could have gotten me back home, tonight.
@AmericanAir Your airport team refused to help me. They claimed the system would not let them cover my hotel because the @AmericanAir "system" blamed the delay on "air traffic control." There was NO air traffic control issue. The problem was that you ran out of fuel. Pilot told us many times.
@AmericanAir This is unacceptable. You lie about covering a hotel room. You lie about why *you* caused me to miss connecting flight. You rebook me on *wrong* flight back, and lie that you can’t correct over the phone. Why would you ever treat your customers this way?
@AmericanAir Also, BS that hotel decisions are handled only by airport team. Airport team said they were not allowed to pay for hotel b/c “system” said issue was “air traffic control.” There was no air traffic control issue. Pilot told us multiple times problem was that you ran out of fuel
@AmericanAir Also your airport team booked me on THE WRONG FLIGHT BACK. I realized only after I left the airport . I called customer service and they refused to change it to the correct flight. They said I have to go back to airport. Will not fix over the phone
.@AmericanAir pilot specifically told us to tell customer service that the problem was fuel so that we would get comp hotel. Instead, after waiting in like 20 min to talk with rep, I was told I was on my own.
This is insane. I missed connecting flight because @AmericanAir de-icing machine *ran out of fuel* and we sat on runway for over an hour while we waited for someone to get fuel. Now refusing to pay for hotel while I am stranded. There’s a reason I never flight this awful airline

Moore also said "A lot of economists thought we were headed back to another recession" due to Obama in 2016. Dunno what this referred to.

Look, forecasting is hard. As Yogi Berra said, it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future. I’m not picking on this particular model. But it’s dishonest for Trumpkins to always cherrypick the outlier forecast, and suggest that it represents consensus.
Recall that Moore also loved to cite the Atlanta Fed forecast as well for Q1, because it was for a hot second predicting &gt;5% growth. The actual number came in at 2.2%. https://t.co/tXqwLarU8t
