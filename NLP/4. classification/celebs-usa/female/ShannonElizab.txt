Think of food as your fuel &amp; treat your body like a temple. If you break it you’ll not only pay for it, but you may never be able to replace it. Please...handle with care! https://t.co/Bi71kcAwnV

@AskDyson @BrigitteDeacon We are having the same issue with ours in South Africa. Can you guide me to help please? Thx.
@AmazonHelp It still doesn’t take me to a human. I went thru that whole process already. I can give you my case number which has my info attached to it if u want. But that contact us thing has gotten me nowhere unfortunately.
@My_Solo_Life You guys are so sweet! Thank you so much!! Happy Holidays xxx
@AmazonHelp I have a case # but nobody has gotten back to me &amp; I get on a flight tomorrow evening &amp; was hoping to have this one replaced somehow by then.
@AmazonHelp I did all of the troubleshooting already. The sound is skipping &amp; popping-hard to describe. It’s really noticable playing music at first &amp; now happens constantly. It’s been going on for a couple of months now. I always have to turn it off because it’s so frustrating.
I buy so much stuff with  @amazon but when my Echo Show breaks nobody wants to help me. Still waiting-leave the country tomorrow
