"I wasn't suggesting he was committing treason" says Judge Sullivan after a recess in the sentencing hearing of Michael Flynn. @NBCNews @GaryGrumbach
Court is back from recess and Flynn has said he wants to go through with sentencing today.  We are still standing by for @NBCNews Special Report.

From @PeteWilliams on @MSNBC: The judge sends "a repeated signal that he's going to impose some prison time if they go ahead with sentencing" @NBCNews
Judge Sullivan calls a recess until 12:30 after what @GaryGrumbach calls "blistering" back and forth between Sullivan and Flynn team. Sullivan questioned whether Flynn could have been charged with treason. @NBCNews
Notes from inside courtroom... Judge Sullivan just offered Flynn the chance to postpone sentencing and continue to help prosecutors. Then said "I can not assure you that if you proceed today, you will not receive a sentence of incarceration." @NBCNews @GaryGrumbach
Flynn Prosecutor: ‚ÄúIt remains a possibility that general Flynn is ‚Äúgoing to continue to cooperate with the government. ‚Äú @NBCNews via @GaryGrumbach
We're standing by for @NBCNews Special Report as soon as we know the sentence for Michael Flynn. Watch your @NBC station.
We are still awaiting sentencing of Michael Flynn. The judge stated: "This is a very serious offense. A high ranking senior official of the government making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation while in the White House." @NBCNews via @GaryGrumbach

Thank you Rachie. We stand by our reporting process. Appreciate that someone appreciates that. https://t.co/pvgBKfT8Fv
We always want to be clear and fully transparent around our reporting, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing here. 8/8
When Senator Grassley cited my interview with Swetnick this week when making a criminal referral, the second woman‚Äôs story became newsworthy again, so we published right away. 7/8
To be clear ‚Äì we did NOT have enough reporting to publish the second woman‚Äôs account until after Justice Kavanaugh secured enough votes for confirmation. 6/8
By the time we were able to find the woman independently from Mr. Avenatti, who declined to give us her full legal name and phone number, and fully report and vet her story, the Kavanaugh confirmation process was over and the news value was limited. 5/8
After repeated requests to Avenatti for corroboration of Swetnick‚Äôs story, he had conferenced us in to a call with a woman. The day after our Swetnick intvw aired, Mr. Avenatti tweeted out a sworn statement from that other woman. It was inconsistent with what she had told us. 4/8
We also made clear ‚Äì in the interest of full transparency ‚Äì that NBC News had not been able to independently verify her claims. 3/8
My interview with Ms. Swetnick aired on October 1. She was making serious claims, so we took care to provide viewers the full context around her allegations and our reporting with a 13+ min piece 2/8
Important context to my and @annaschecter‚Äôs story regarding a second woman Michael Avenatti put forward to corroborate Julie Swetnick‚Äôs claims about Brett Kavanaugh 1/8

‚ÄúI did not hide Dr Ford‚Äôs allegation... she asked me to keep it confidential‚Äù @SenFeinstein #KavanaughHearing @NBCNews
"I think they both believe they're telling the truth" @ChuckTodd just said @NBCNews. I've been thinking that all day. Ford &amp; Kavanaugh appear to both believe with all their heart that they're speaking the truth.
Judge Kavanaugh fights tears describing how his 10 year old daughter said "we should pray for the woman".  Says he doesn't doubt she may have been assaulted, but began his statement by saying he was never at the party she describes. #KavanaughHearings
(3/3) Ford also described "constant harassment and death threats", family forced to move. Asked how certain she was that Kavanaugh was her attacker: "100 percent"
She has described deciding to come forward when Kavanaugh's name was reported to be on a short list for the Supreme Court &amp; asking friends at her beach vaca how to do that. Says she didn't know how to reach people in power
Some highlights of Dr Ford's testimony so far for those who are working &amp; can't watch:  "I am terrified...here because I believe it's my civic duty"  "The details about that night that bring me here today are the ones I will never forget" (1/3)
