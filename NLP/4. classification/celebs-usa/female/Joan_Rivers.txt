As a wedding gift, Ray J gave Kim Kardashian his profits from their sex tape. It’s “Something Old” as well as “Something Blew.”

Attention “Walking Dead” I figured how to get zombies to run away from you. Start a knock-down fight with your daughter @MelRivers. #JKB
Thank God for French Stewart @FrenchStewart! He was perfect at breaking the ice. #JKB
I love working in animation. You never get old! Wonder Woman is 160 and her boobs are perkier than Kelly Ripa on three cups of coffee. #JKB
It was nice of Melissa to offer to cancel her plans in order to watch “Rosemary’s Baby.” I think of it as the feel-good movie of 1968. #JKB
All of those people covered in mustard got me thinking…I should do a sex tape for the Food Channel #JKB
I love meeting new neighbors. It’s always nice to see the faces of the people I’m eventually going to fight with. #JKB
I finally found a use for the kitchen pass-thru! Melissa doesn’t entertain so it’s now used for eavesdropping on our assistants. #JKB
If this matzoh ball thing works out, Melissa and I will single-handedly be responsible for constipating America #JKB
I adore Canter’s! They have the best deli in LA... or as we call it, “Jewish comfort food.” #JKB
My first-grade teacher said I needed “commendation”? No I didn’t! I needed applause and a limo. #JKB

Tori and Dean think they had a bad sex life? Mine was so bad, when we finished my husband would ask, “Was it good for anyone?!?"
Meet Lance, my favorite Joan Ranger in Medicine Hat! And possibly the butchest!!! http://t.co/0cWApLpSDb
Don't even THINK about coming backstage in Medicine Hat. http://t.co/ciAlAIDwNj

I’m so worried about Kim and Kanye’s wedding. Their photo album is going to be the first ever that has a money shot.
Melissa and I really pulled it off. Are we ready for Vegas? Maybe Penn and Teller need an opening act! #JKB
I can’t get in "The Squisher." My bones will break! I don’t know why Melissa’s upset – after this she’ll be able to fit in a size 2. #JKB
Where’s Marissa’s theatrical spirit? She should be like Tom Cruise after his wedding--you don’t want to "do it" but the show must go on #JKB
These toucans are crazy! Frank seems terrified of Mia. It could’ve been worse. We could’ve gotten a third toucan and named him Woody. #JKB
Cutting a person in half is weird. I felt like Jeffrey Dahmer trying to practice portion control. #JKB
Marissa Jaret Winokur has such energy, such zest, such pizazz. Wait until she sees I’m cutting her in half. I hope she packed Xanax. #JKB
I don’t know why Melissa’s so upset about the toucans. She ought to be thankful. At my age, she’s lucky they’re not vultures circling. #JKB
When I saw Cooper’s parakeet presentation, I thought, “He’s my little Bill Gates! And someday he’ll be worth billions.” #DollarsforNana #JKB
Adam says I need a BIG TRICK. I wonder if I can pull a husband out of a hat for Melissa. #JKB
My tricks and illusions suck. I’m in trouble. Time to take a crash course in magic. Enter Adam! #JKB
Usually when someone walks around Santa Monica saying they’re looking for tricks, they get arrested. #JKB
Penn wants me to snort a bean and pass it out me eye? I’ve had so much work done - there’s no telling where that bean will end up. #JKB
Did Penn ask me to fill in for Teller because we’re friends or because just once he wants to be able to tell his partner to shut up? #JKB
Coming up, back-to-back all-new episodes of "Joan &amp; Melissa: Joan Knows Best?" on @WEtv. Starting in 10 minutes! #JKB
Justin Bieber was detained at LAX. Customs probably thought he was smuggling 14 illegal aliens in those saggy pants.

Kirstie Alley has returned to Jenny Craig. She wants to lose 30 pounds, or roughly one Olsen Twin.
So what! I texted under the influence and it has happened before. During the Bicentennial, I drunk-dialed half the US Navy. #JKB
Melissa is right. I need to “let go” of my priceless Queen Victoria chair. Tony just made it easier by calling it his “Joan Throne.” #JKB
Melissa gave me that sleeping pill in CT. She’s a one-woman drug operation – the infamous Rivers Cartel. #JKB
Tony’s new house is so gay, there’s a portrait of Liza hanging in the bathroom. #JKB
The way Melissa is confronting Cooper’s lacrosse coach, she can take on anyone. The Ukraine? Send Melissa to talk to Putin. #JKB
I adore Tony but I never would have parted with my Queen Victoria chair. Someone has to get it back for me… #JKB
Why won’t Melissa heed my advice? She’s such a prude. Wanna get a man’s attention? GET NAKED! #JKB
I love it when Cooper gives it his all in lacrosse. I love him even more after he takes a shower. #JKB
The night before I leave CT, I need to sleep. Sunny Von Bulow took a Xanax and slept 28 years. I’ll take a half and maybe doze an hour. #JKB
The KKK has a better thread count in their sheets than the ones in Melissa’s guest room. #JKB
This year was tough. I lost my sister, my dog and my house. I lost more than Bernie Madoff, except everything was mine. #JKB
.@Christies auction house came to my home in Connecticut to appraise my antiques. They tried to put me on the block. #JKB
I loved the portraits of the creepy ladies in my guest room. They always kept an eye on all my house guests. #JKB
Selling my Connecticut country home is awful. I envy the homeless. If they lose a house, they just have to go find another box. #JKB

I’ve had a rough couple of months. I need to pamper myself. I’m going to the Hermes store for some retail therapy. #JKB
I’ve lost my sister and I’ve lost my dog. The only thing I haven’t lost is five pounds. #JKB
Melissa has a snow globe collection. Maybe I should Max’s ashes in the NYC one? #JKB
How did I get roped into helping Lynne bathe her dog, Aldo? I don’t even wash my own hair. #JKB
The stuffed dogs in Evolution and I have something in common. We’ve both had so much work done, neither of us can move or blink. #JKB
Duncan dropped an F-Bomb?! The British accent makes it sound so much classier than when I do it. #JKB
Thank goodness Lynne stepped in to help plan Max’s funeral. If nothing else, there will be plenty of food and snacks. #JKB
Of course I’m planning a funeral for Max. He was the man of the house and he deserves a proper send-off. #JKB
I’d give Max a kidney if I thought it would help. Not mine of course – one I found on the internet. #JKB
Excited for the @MichaelKors fashion show! Nothing picks up my spirits like designer clothes, gay men and anorexic models! #JKB
Nothing makes me happier than Fashion Week in NYC. The energy, the styles…and sleeping in my own bed! #JKB
Devastated about my sick Pekingese Max. I’ve tried everything to help him – maybe acupuncture for dogs will work. #JKB

It was fun while it lasted but it’s also nice going back to being glamorous! Anyone want to buy a scooter? #JKB
The Fashion Police execs say I have choices to make. Yeah? So did the Kardashians: Should we go out with the Knicks or the Lakers? #JKB
I had a blast riding my scooter around Beverly Hills! Can’t an old lady just have a little fun sometimes? #JKB
If they’re all upset at my old-lady look, wait until they see what I’m doing to try to get the lead in “Lassie.” #JKB
Mike White wants to cast an old lady with an edge? I’ll give him Helen Mirren with ‘roid rage! #JKB
Melissa is pleading the fifth. And all of this started because Lynne drank a fifth and went home with Duncan. #JKB
I’d love to work with Whitney Cummings. I’d give up two major organs for this part: My boobs. No one is using them anyway. #JKB
I’m totally with Kris Jenner and upholding family loyalty. Thank god I don’t have five daughters – I can barely handle my one! #JKB
After witnessing that fight between Lynne and Melissa, Kris Jenner has certainly earned her wine. #JKB

Wow! @RayJ was AMAZING in bed. At this age, when the men I sleep with climax, they yell out their nurse’s name. #JKB
Poor Duncan. Lynne obviously had too much to drink. It looks like it’s time for Lynne to go home…alone. #JKB
I’m really hurt. I can’t believe these performers walked out. Now I know what it’s like going to a Justin Bieber concert. #JKB
These naked guys auditioning are fine, but where do they keep their credit cards? How am I supposed to rifle through their wallets? #JKB
527 films!This porn star has a bigger film career than I do. Instead of the Actor’s Studio, I should have gone to the Playboy Mansion. #JKB
These porn actors were so good, I didn’t know whether to applaud or have a cigarette. #JKB
There’s a porn film called “Orgy University”? Do the girls major in doggie-style and minor in STDs? #JKB
Meeting with Steve Hirsch has me thinking. I could open up a whole new market: Nana Porn! #JKB
Everything in Vivid Studios is white. It’s whiter in there than at an office party at Paula Deen’s. #JKB
Lynne’s right. There is a market for everything. Think about it – millions of people sit and watch Honey Boo Boo, eat and fart. #JKB
Melissa’s ignoring my advice about doing porn. The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach, but the way to his cash is his zipper #JKB
Lynne Koplitz is like Michelle Duggar’s menstrual cycles – late all the time. #JKB
Kris Jenner has me milking a cow? Ridiculous. I’m lactose intolerant, so go moo yourself! #JKB
Duncan is staying in a hotel? Melissa is a prude and she didn’t get it from me! I’ve let Shriners and carny folk sleep over. #JKB
Melissa came back from sunny Hawaii without a tan? Hmm…did she and Duncan spend their vacation indoors? #JKB

Also heard that Charles Manson’s wedding to his young fiancé will be traditional. The priest will say "I now pronounce you maniac and wife."

Nicole Kidman said Tom Cruise wasn’t the love of her life. WHAT?! A rich gay guy who always works and never wants sex? That’s my dream man!
WAIT! It just dawned on me why Jennifer Lawrence fell on her way up to the stage to get her Oscar. She tripped over her own arrogance.
But now that she has a movie to promote, suddenly we’re picking on all those poor, helpless actors.
It’s funny how Jennifer Lawrence loved @E_FashionPolice during Awards Season when we were complimenting her every single week...
"Tan Mom" is divorcing her husband because his penis is small. Was it always, or does it have the good sense to hide when she’s in the room?

Kris Jenner showed off her iPhone case, which says "Queen of F*cking Everything!" Kim has the same one, just without the word "Everything."

Here it is...my new latest @InBedWithJoan episode with the wonderful @RuPaul!  Take a look! http://t.co/Za76sgD6ax
Drunk Reese Witherspoon told cops, "You're about to find out who I am." Odd, that's what I say in the mirror before taking off my makeup.
Get ready for my next episode of @InBedWithJoan, featuring the fabulous @RuPaul! Tune in later on today! http://t.co/CHMpAdqD5A
Please join me on @QVC at 3pm EDT for an hour of fresh Spring looks – including my Rose &amp; Peony Floral Print Jacket! http://t.co/baYqj6Nmp4

Heading down to @QVC. I'll be on-air from 6-7pm EDT with my Couture Chic Sunglasses with Pave Butterfly Detail! http://t.co/xEGXMRb5bN.
Had a great time at the Matrix Awards with @MelRivers today, as emcee! Also introduced my @WEtv boss, Kim Martin! http://t.co/FEQsxOsCvL
So many pictures circulating of Miley Cyrus smoking a blunt. I bet her dealer gets more of her money than Billy Ray does!
This week's @e_FashionPolice was full of special guests, including @TheJaimePressly. Don't miss it! http://t.co/Lg3bjRS3ht
My plastic surgeon is so rude. I just saw the name he put on my file: Mrs. Potato Head.
Look who else is our guest on tonight's @e_FashionPolice! It's @wendiemalick! Tune in to E! at 10pm tonight. http://t.co/fGDLIDFZGA
Here I am with the very funny @BrookeBurns. She was a great guest on tonight’s all new @e_FashionPolice. 10pm on E! http://t.co/SzIlPr48zm
Special congratulations to my dear friend @EnterMissThang on the induction of @TheDonnaSummer into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall Of Fame. Well done!
Justin Bieber was 3 hours late to his own concert in Germany. I’d never do that. I already have people calling me “The Late Joan Rivers.”
YES!!! My next episode of @InBedWithJoan is live!  I’m honored to share my bed with the hysterical @anthonyjeselnik. http://t.co/cJOAgzkw70
Thank you Dennett from my @AmericanAir flight to LAX today.The ONLY flight attendant on board that was able to fix my light so I could work!

My friend Chuck bakes 2000+ birthday cakes a year for @godslovenyc clients! Help support their Birthday Cake Campaign http://t.co/ZjOiC8R5Am
No jokes. Watching the Boston coverage-this is just terrible, terrible, terrible.  My thoughts and prayers are with everyone.
Target got in trouble for naming a plus-size dress “Manatee Grey.” It’s better than their original name, “Oh God, Here It Comes Charcoal."
We also had the amazing @Fergie on this week's @e_FashionPolice! What a show! http://t.co/qWDB8gqwAj
What incredible guests we had on this week's @e_FashionPolice! The hilarious @anagasteyer, and... http://t.co/7YP95vBW1O
Gwyneth Paltrow says Botox made her “Scary like Joan Rivers.” I’ll tell you what’s scary – when your son brings home a girl named Apple.
Just flew back to NYC and I had the whole first class cabin to myself. It was Heaven!!! http://t.co/QyLBuzpfgq
Thank you all for watching this season of #JKB! Don’t forget, you can see full episodes of @InBedWithJoan at http://t.co/PCrtpsKNPd.
This boat party can only be salvaged if Tony and Lynne both go overboard. But it needs to look like an accident. #JKB
This boat party is off to a very bad start. It’s cold and the seas are rough. All we need are some Somali Pirates. #JKB
After interviewing @TheKatVonD in IKEA, I know I can take @InBedWithJoan on the road. But can I get used to strange bathrooms? #JKB
Thrilled @TheKatVonD agreed to do @InBedWithJoan in the middle of an IKEA. I wish getting all my guests was this simple. #JKB
IKEA furniture is just like me. It looks more expensive than it is and it’s all about how you put it together. #JKB
My mother NEVER walked in on me having sex! Then again, she didn’t have a set of keys to my Chevy. #JKB
Tony wants to co-host @InBedWithJoan, which is the first time he ever asked to get into bed with a woman. #JKB
Hold on. I’m switching over to @E_FashionPolice mode for a moment: What the F*CK is Lynne wearing!? #JKB
My guest on @InBedWithJoan is none other than @SarahKSilverman whose book was called “The Bedwetter.” Wish me luck. #JKB
Duncan is coming to L.A. from London. Either this guy has the hots for @MelRivers or he REALLY likes Disneyland. #JKB
I can’t believe @MelRivers would trust Lynne with such a big secret. Why am I always the last one to know? #JKB
Tonight’s season finale of #JKB features @SarahKSilverman and @TheKatVonD, both of whom I interviewed for @InBedWithJoan.
Michael Lohan thinks Lindsay going to Coachella is “the worst idea ever.” I guess he hasn’t seen the trailer for Scary Movie 5.
See what @SarahKSilverman thinks about the set of @InBedWithJoan on the season finale of #JKB TONIGHT @WEtv at 9pm!  http://t.co/tLxDkO4Muo

Here's a clip from tomorrow’s season finale of Joan and Melissa: Joan Knows Best on @Wetv. So I forgot to knock...  http://t.co/BWNsXPxcnG
Gwyneth claims Botox made her "Scary, like Joan Rivers."  Sweetie, you should see how scary I'd be without it!
LOVED having @Fergie on @e_FashionPolice. She's so much fun.  Don’t miss this episode! Tonight at 10pm on E! http://t.co/ZB6da2XiNW
Don't miss the season finale of Joan and Melissa: Joan Knows Best? Saturday on @WEtv at 9pm!  Here's a sneak peek. http://t.co/yw1o2vGpDR
Reading that California now has the Powerball. I'm confused. Hasn't Lance Armstrong lived here for years?
Don’t miss me and @melrivers with @IamSteveHarvey tomorrow! We’re both trying to find her the perfect man to date! http://t.co/rRaQ38LyJd
Rumor has it that Kim Kardashian is very upset. She just realized that there's a 50 percent chance her baby will be white.
Had a great time with @KellyRipa and @michaelstrahan on @KellyandMichael this morning. LOVE the new set. http://t.co/il23x4089x
On my way to @KellyandMichael. Looking forward to seeing @KellyRipa and finally meeting @michaelstrahan. This will be fun!
Speaking of @InBedWithJoan, my new episode with @margaretcho is LIVE! Watch it now...really...RIGHT NOW! http://t.co/s4oDt73Uhr
Had great time discussing my internet talk show @InBedWithJoan (new episode is live NOW) with the WSJ’s @leehawkins. http://t.co/YALIYUKvfd
And the play date comes to an end. Sam is exhausted. It's very hard keeping up with a younger man - Digby's only 1. http://t.co/DJvPg1YBLI
My worst fear came true! Digby got a little excited and had an accident on my new Stark carpet. Good thing he's cute. http://t.co/Dy1VilwrXi
It's a puppy play date! Sam and her best (and only) friend Digby are having a rare get together. (Digby is from D.C.) http://t.co/wh1qCooCQF
Excited for my new episode of @InBedWithJoan featuring @margaretcho. It will go live tomorrow so don't miss it! http://t.co/u9rMfszNEf
A very sad start to the week with so many deaths. And, I’m referring to my speed-dates.
Annette Funicello’s death truly saddens me. She was such a bright and wonderful part of all of our history.
Thanks to @brugli for this photo from the  @KinkyBootsBway opening. Me &amp; Liza, my BFF (only she doesn't know it yet)! http://t.co/bkPWQP8cti

Just read that sex in outer space could be bad for your health, so all future NASA missions will manned by a married couple of 7 years.
Thank you all for watching! Don’t miss next week’s big season finale! #JKB
Thanks to the Pool at Bethesda Choir for making one of my bucket-list dreams come true! #JKB
The doctor said that I had walking pneumonia, which is surprising. At my age, it should be using a motorized wheelchair. #JKB
Do I really need Cooper’s ominous background music while I get my test results from Dr. Kipper? #JKB
I’m such a city girl. Item #34 on my bucket list is “hold an actual bucket.” #JKB
Working my way down my bucket list. Next item? Two words: Ryan Gosling. #JKB
Truth be told, this is not my first bucket list. I’ve ordered twelve pieces – wings, legs and thighs – from KFC before. #JKB
Melissa needs to accept the fact that someday I won’t be here. Yes, someday I’ll find my own place to live. #JKB
Why do my @InBedWithJoan guests all have the same puzzled and frightened look when they see our “green room”? #JKB
Rest my voice? Are you nuts? That’s like asking Lindsay Lohan to rest her liver. Not gonna happen! #JKB
I lost my voice, but I won’t miss a show! I can mime the jokes and they can bill me as the Marcel Marceau of Comedy. #JKB
Forget about these home remedies. I’m Jewish…just give me a cup of chicken soup already! #JKB
Melissa’s concerned about dating a man who lives 5000 miles away? To me that’s the recipe for a perfect relationship! #JKB
Laryngitis is so frustrating. In order to nag @MelRivers, I’m going to have to learn sign language. #JKB
Here’s a sneak peek at tonight’s  #JKB where I deal with my estrangement from Johnny Carson!  http://t.co/RCiGKgOH49 9pm @WEtv
I was a Lucky Girl to see Tom Hanks in Lucky Guy! The cast and Tom are spectacular! Here we are with Geraldo Rivera! http://t.co/vfuTzVJOht
Back in NYC. Love seeing Broadway musicals. They work even if you don’t speak English. In fact, sometimes it even helps.
On tonight’s “Joan &amp; Melissa - Joan Knows Best?” don’t miss a special appearance by Ellie Kemper, my guest on @InBedWithJoan! #JKB 9pm @WEtv
We also have @KristinCav on @e_FashionPolice tonight. Great to have you back! Shall we say glutton for punishment? http://t.co/mMLN866VCz
Do you really need to ask??? RT @darianicola I want to know what @Joan_Rivers thinks of belly button rings.
Happy Happy birthday @Barbara_Bup!  Hope you have a wonderful day. xoxo  PS.  Thanks @CONY_STAR for the reminder!!!
Looks who's on tonight’s @e_FashionPolice!!! @EdwardWeeks is not only handsome but also VERY funny. Big-time combo! http://t.co/a9q4ykUHAn
Tomorrow night is an all new episode of #JKB at 9pm on @WEtv. I start my bucket list...what is on YOUR bucket list?   http://t.co/uftuOn8e1S

If you're a theatre buff and you want to see the final few performances of one of the Great Ones, go see Elaine Stritch at the Carlyle!
Just heard about the death of Roger Ebert. He was a nice, nice man. I truly liked him - I'm very sad.
Attention! If you're not in the USA, don't worry! http://t.co/PCrtpsKNPd is not restricted - you too can see an all-new episode each week!
We know North Korea has declared the 1953 armistice invalid. But did you know it upheld its pledge to produce short, angry supreme leaders.
An expensive study of dust mites reveals that reverse evolution is possible. Who cares? I figured that out while watching Honey Boo Boo.
Here’s a JKB extra! Cooper, @MelRivers &amp; I continue our tradition of delivering Thanksgiving dinner for @godslovenyc  http://t.co/hVCZ5CXe4f
Attention New York, New Jersey &amp; Connecticut! I'm performing at SUNY Purchase PAC, Sunday at 7pm! A few tickets left http://t.co/13hirKoMEI

Only @DrOz could get us to wear these ugly purple gloves! Tune in to his show tomorrow to see why. http://t.co/QUN6zhSI7z
Tomorrow @MelRivers and I will be appearing on @DrOz. It was truly a pleasure to finally meet him and be on his show! http://t.co/WKDQJc30Zi
David Beckham couldn’t accept his @e_fashionpolice stylish athlete award in person so he sent these two guys instead! http://t.co/jAMM1LHjQj
On my way to @QVC! I'll be on-air during PM Style at 7pm ET. Don't miss my brand new Vintage Scroll Pattern Caftan! http://t.co/eQLpm52qwi
Nobody showed up for my Easter egg hunt, yesterday! My living room has so many eggs, it looks like a fertility clinic.
Twyttyr? Why byy vywyls whyn yyy gyt "Y" fyr fryy? Syckyrs! #nvwls
I’m forgetful. At my Easter egg hunt I said, “While you’re looking for the eggs, there’s 50 bucks to the person who can find my car keys.”
Looking forward to the #BibleSeriesFinale on @History tonight! Happy Easter and congratulations to @MarkBurnettTV and @RealRomaDowney.
Happy Easter, everyone! Invited to a friend’s for dinner tonight. I’m Jewish – what do I bring? Lox and bunnies?
Thanks, everyone, for watching tonight. Even though it’s not Thanksgiving today, giving thanks works for Easter and Passover too! #JKB
Help! There’s more trash lined up in the street outside my place than there is at Miley Cyrus’s house. #JKB
I performed during the first Thanksgiving in 1621. The crowd wanted to eat fast and get back to the blackjack tables. #JKB
Enough with Lynne being topless in my home! Cooper’s unfazed, but Duncan doesn’t need to sneak a peek. #JKB
Lynne got naked and crawled into bed with me! Now I can relate to guys all over the world. #JKB
Lynne and @MelRivers are acting like children touching each other’s food. Next time they’re getting kiddie menus. #JKB
I can’t believe Lynne was eating an 8-year-old piece of cake-from a ROYAL wedding nonetheless! She’ll truly put anything in her mouth. #JKB
Dropping Edgar’s family’s gravy boat is possibly the biggest mistake Lynne has ever made (that doesn’t involve booze or men). #JKB
I don’t know who’s more upset that Lynne is sleeping in my bed – me or my dogs, Sam and Max. #JKB
Melissa’s always waiting for the other shoe to drop, which is not bad if it’s a Jimmy Choo. #JKB
In New York City, trash stays in front of your house until it’s picked up…or busted by the vice squad. #JKB
Poor Lynne has no luck with men. She gets dumped more often than toxic waste. #JKB
I’m at my happiest when entertaining in my NYC apartment. There’s so much to think about for Thanksgiving to be just perfect.  #JKB
Get ready for an all new episode of Joan and Melissa: Joan Knows Best? coming up RIGHT NOW on @WEtv!  #JKB
Yes, I know it’s Passover and Easter, but tonight on #JKB at 9pm on @WEtv we celebrate Thanksgiving, my favorite holiday. #JKB
Lots of talk of Easter and Passover. I’m starting my own religion, and why not? Look at me naked and you’ll know Melissa was a virgin birth.
Another great theater evening! Watch 2 great actors go at it in Talley's Folly! Here I am with Danny Burstein! http://t.co/d13yLKMDgs

@amberlovespie10 I wasn't sure that was you on Huff Post, and I didn't want to embarrass the girl I "thought was you." You looked adorable!!
On my way to @HuffPostLive to talk about JKB and my web show @InBedWithJoan.  I’m live at 2:30pmET.  Streams live: http://t.co/p60lyM3tZj
Passover and Easter are overlapping this weekend, so I've decided to dye my matzo balls.
David will be back on air at 2pm ET today with my Tulip Scarf. The perfect accessory for spring!  http://t.co/94QXio9ckQ
Tomorrow on JKB-9pm on @WEtv-I get stuck sharing my bedroom with Lynne...an interesting experience. Take a look! http://t.co/tziUaZXxe9
Don't miss David Dangle, tonight at 1am ET with my amazing Floral Bouquet 3/4 Sleeve Jacket! http://t.co/MHjeX5iU9r http://t.co/j24dcBmDuu
Actually 135. RT ‏@troystephane8m @Joan_Rivers yeah, you're one to talk about age... Aren't you like 109 years old?
Last week, Madonna said she wanted to become a Boy Scout, but they wouldn't let her join. That's because the cutoff age is 18, not 81.
Just back from LA and now on my way to @QVC. I'm on air at 4pm ET with one of my favorites-the Evil Eye bracelet! http://t.co/p7SeXXMu5F
Here's a sneak peek of an all new Joan and Melissa: Joan's Knows Best? Saturday at 9pm on @WEtv. Have a look! http://t.co/RNiBnCy5Zr
After two Passover Seders, finding out that matzo is very binding. Now I know why it really took us 40 years to cross the desert.

Finally we have time to bond! Shopping and lecturing @MelRivers are two of my favorite pastimes. #JKB
We can’t find Tony! We’re checking every emergency room, police station and gay bar in town. #JKB
Poor Tony! London hasn’t seen bombing this bad since the Blitz. #JKB
Yes, the countess thought that Tony was hilarious and adorable. This is also coming from a woman with a pet skunk. #JKB
This date between @MelRivers and Duncan has more awkward silences than a conversation with Helen Keller. #JKB
These waders make us look like a group of Oompa Loompas wearing adult diapers. #JKB
Usually when you scream, “Graham” in an English restaurant, at least six men turn around. #JKB
I love everything that Kelly Brook is showing @MelRivers: the lingerie, the casual wear…the cute publicist, Duncan. #JKB
Yes, the countess is a bit eccentric. Instead of a dog, she has an albino skunk…on a leash. #JKB
So excited that @MelRivers is coming to the UK with me! Thrilled she’ll be a part of my big tour. #JKB
Tony knows me so well. If you want something from me, a bribe is a GREAT place to start. #JKB
Stacey says that @MelRivers needs to establish boundaries with me. They really should have run this idea by me first. #JKB
Why is @MelRivers so worried about coming to England? All she has to do is postpone her entire life… What’s the big deal? #JKB
When I saw something purple coming out of the closet, I thought to myself, “Be proud, Barney!” #JKB
Isn’t @MissKellyO such a good sport for doing @inbedwithjoan? I don’t think she’s ever been in such a “unique” green room before. #JKB
OK, everyone! An all-new episode of "Joan &amp; Melissa - Joan Knows Best?" is coming up in a few minutes on @WEtv. Tune in...we go to London!!!

Happy St. Patrick's Day! What the hell is Shrek going to wear today?
Of course we need to be prepared for disasters, but @MelRivers lives in Malibu where CPR stands for Caviar, Perrier and Rolex. #JKB
I’m a Jewish mother. It’s my duty to set up my single daughter at every moment. @MelRivers – get married or get used to it. #JKB
Yes! I want to raise livestock, just like all the other farmers in Malibu. What’s the problem??? #JKB
If we’re going off the grid, we’ll need livestock: Chickens, a milk cow and oysters – pearls don’t grow on trees, you know. #JKB
Excited to be able to perform on multiple stages at one time. More excited to still be able to nag @MelRivers from beyond the grave. #JKB
I’m from New York so my idea of preparing for The Big One is being first on line for a sale at Bloomingdales. #JKB
WOW, I learned a lot about earthquakes. They’re caused by shifting fault lines or it’s God telling you it’s time to redecorate. #JKB
So excited to go on stage as a hologram! I’m just like Tupac at Coachella…if he was an elderly Jewish woman. #JKB
With a Joan Rivers hologram, being in two different cities at the same time is no longer restricted to my thighs. #JKB
I don’t understand the aftershocks. What, is Mother Earth having multiple orgasms? Showoff! #JKB
Thrilled to have @ChrisBHarrison from The Bachelor/The Bachelorette as my guest on @InBedWithJoan! What's the deal with the roses? #JKB
The earthquake was very scary! Not as scary as having to use a broom for the first time, but very scary. #JKB
OK East Coast USA get ready...an all new episode of #JKB is coming up at 9pm on @WEtv. Tune in to see @chisbharrison on @InBedWithJoan!

Steven Tyler wants to record a song with Taylor Swift. Taylor's game, but first needs to date and dump him for lyrical inspiration.
Who's watched my internet chat show @InBedWithJoan? Here's a behind the scenes look at how the show began. http://t.co/nuSUYIT3Kk
The new Pope is off to a bad start. Wearing white before Memorial Day...Oy.
Are you prepared for an earthquake? Watch this clip from Saturday's episode of #JKB-9pm on @Wetv-and you decide! http://t.co/Qx1baPlk8r
Here I come Columbia, MO! I’m  performing TOMORROW at the University of Missouri! Some tickets still available http://t.co/G3iUATAspt
Waiting for the Pope to emerge on the balcony in a white gown. Doubt he'll be singing “Don’t Cry for me Argentina.” A missed opportunity!
We don’t know who the new pontiff is yet, but I'll bet you anything it won't be Pope Liebowitz.
A new Pope has been chosen! I haven't seen this many people transfixed by a puff of white smoke since the discovery of fire!
A new study says that ham, bacon and sausage increase the risk of dying young. It certainly shortens the life of the pig.

A 61-year-old woman and an 8-year-old boy in South Africa have tied the knot. Actually, she had to tie it for him.
Was just sent this picture while on my flight home from Dallas. Look who's waiting for me to walk in the door! http://t.co/GdRrXB2ODa
Demi Moore is demanding spousal support from Ashton Kutcher. They'll first have to raise his weekly allowance.
OK, Dallas! I’m performing at the Winspear Opera House/AT&amp;T PAC tonight!!! There are some seats still available! http://t.co/AKQL1sdMm6
I don’t know what frightens me more, being arrested by the police or facing @MelRivers when I get home. #JKB Thanks for watching tonight!
Costco banned my book because of the “obscenities” on the back cover.  Really? All I can say is: wait until you look inside! #JKB
I can’t believe how much Cooper is growing up. He amazes me every day. #JKB
I’m over the bus thing! I still haven’t recovered from my first trip across the country by stagecoach. #JKB
I LOVE it. This store sells wine in a purse! A great gift for fashionable drunks.  #JKB
Yes, I offered two strangers $10 to drive me to a liquor store. What’s the problem? That seemed like a reasonable fare to me. #JKB
It still smells on the rock-star bus. We should probably check under the beds – there might be a dead groupie. #JKB
I love Plymouth Plantation with its primitive charm and period costumes. It reminds me of my childhood. #JKB
Something on this RV stinks! And yes, I’ve accounted for the fact that there are two 11-year-old boys on board. #JKB
I just realized this RV doesn’t have a terrace or a hot tub. Who am I, Honey Boo Boo? #JKB
So far so good! I definitely impressed Cooper and Julian with my version of a minivan. #JKB
So now Julian is coming along on "Grandma Week"?  Is there something that @MelRivers hasn’t told me? #JKB
I love small, Independent bookstores! I hope they can stay in business even with Nooks, Kindles and iPads,...and whatever!!!  #JKB
Ok who's ready to watch the next episode of #JKB? Tune in at 9pm on @Wetv and witness the adventures of "Grandma Week"…..I know…I know!!!

Thank you all for watching tonight's episode of #JKB! @InBedWithJoan will  air on March 5th at http://t.co/tZlvcCRd5v so don’t miss it!
Melissa is wrong. I did not hijack @RealJoeFrancis . He willingly came into my bedroom! Fully dressed….but willingly! #JKB
Not a good start! My first guest on my new show @InBedWithJoan just walked off the set! Guess it’s time to improvise! #JKB
I love @Kato_Kaelin!!!  He was so much fun to interview for @InBedWithJoan.  I will let you know when that episode will air! #JKB
I love having my guests come out of my closet on @InBedWithJoan. But if Kato won’t do it we can forget about booking John Travolta. #JKB
Kato Kaelin?  Melissa booked Kato Kaelin as my first guest for @InBedWithJoan?  At least I didn’t scream “Over my dead body!”  #JKB
The set for @InBedWithJoan looks amazing!  I’m so excited to get my first guest booked and get going.  #JKB
Hollywood sure is a tough town. Cooper’s only 11 and he’s already considered too old for the business. #JKB
How adorable is @GeorgeKotsi???  #JKB
Being a booker is tough.  Everybody seems to be busy or, well, busy.  Would it be weird to have Cooper on as my first guest? #JKB
@paddycullivan You're hired!!!!
I’m going to need a full TV crew for my new show.  “Help Wanted: Long hours, no pay, but a chance to meet a comedy legend!” #JKB
Just wondering…why is Melissa paying this woman for advice when I’ve been giving her perfect advice for free her entire life? #JKB
I see the future....I can have a talk show on the internet out of my bedroom.  And no one can tell me what to say!  I LOVE it.   #JKB
Melissa’s having a heart-to-heart with @RealJoeFrancis? If there’s one person who knows how she feels it’s the creator of Girls Gone Wild.
I just adore Chris Hardwick @nerdist.  We had great fun together-along with @jonahray-on his podcast.  And he’s very SMART! #JKB
I can say anything I want on the air during a podcast?  That’s amazing!!!  Just one question:  What’s a podcast?  #JKB
I’m so sick of constantly being censored on TV.  Will I ever have a chance to say what I really think? HA HA HA #JKB
Tune in NOW for an all new episode of #JKB featuring @GeorgeKotsi, Chris Hardwick @nerdist, @jonahray, @RealJoeFrancis and @Kato_Kaelin.

On Sunday night, you could easily pick Adele's Oscar statuette out of a lineup. It was the only one wearing Spanx.
Attention Joan Rangers!!! Tonight's @e_FashionPolice Oscar special is 90 minutes long and starts at 8:30.  Tune in on time!
We also have @SarahKSilverman on @e_FashionPolice tonight. She is hysterical as always! Loved seeing you Sarah! http://t.co/NA5sFHdQ0t
Just finished taping our @e_FashionPolice 90 minute Oscar show with guest @ninagarcia. Join us tonight at 8:30! http://t.co/axFTA4W9fD
Great to hear that John Travolta will be presenting tonight at the Oscars. Exactly what and to whom is any masseur’s guess.
When I attend the Oscars I'm on the edge of my seat. Not because I'm nominated-I just don't want to catch anything from some starlet.
Its Oscar Sunday!!! Lots of product placement in “Lincoln.” There were too many scenes featuring Sally Field as Mary Todd taking Boniva
Thank you all for watching and tweeting about the premiere of Joan and Melisa: Joan Knows Best? We're back next Saturday at 9 on @WEtv,
Seeing @MelRivers, Cooper and John together again makes me wonder of love. Like leftover lasagna it's better the second time around. #JKB
I’ve been through some weird break ups before, but today, when I said, “It’s not you, it’s me,” I really meant it! #JKB
I hated having to tell Lynne that she’s put on a little weight. That went down pretty well…like the Titanic. #JKB
Well…that was definitely a first! #JKB
Going to dinner with Shirl and I don’t know what to wear. Why am I so nervous? It’s not like this is a date…right? #JKB
I know I’ve gained weight. Yesterday I got a text message from my Spanx saying, “SOS! SOS! SOS!” #JKB
Shirl’s my friend so now Lynne thinks I’m gay. I’ll straighten her out right after we get back from the k.d. lang concert. #JKB
This pottery class will save @MelRivers a fortune. I can now make my own urn. #JKB
John told @MelRivers he’d only stay for a few days – just like I told her when I moved in…three years ago! #JKB
Shirl’s taking me to a pottery class. She’s gay - so what! Nothing confusing about two gals molding wet, sensuous clay together, right? #JKB
Going to an art gallery with my new friend Shirl. Gotta keep moving or someone might think I’m an exhibit. #JKB
So @MelRivers keeps her therapist on speed dial. Which is just fine...I do the same thing with my plastic surgeon. #JKB
@802mountain @WEtv
Great! While John’s house is about to be tented, Melissa’s house will be the three-ring circus. #JKB
Tonight’s season premiere of Joan &amp; Melissa: Joan Knows Best? featuring @LilyTomlin, @JaneMarieLynch and @JaiRodriguez starts NOW!!! #JKB
So excited for the return of #JKB! Here's a clip from tonight’s show. http://t.co/de8JndnloK. Find out all about my date at 9pm on @WEtv!
Rumor has it Oscar nominee Anne Hathaway has had more fittings on her Oscars gown than Pope Benedict had during his entire papacy.
ABC is so worried about what Seth MacFarlane might say hosting the Oscars that instead of a 7-second delay, they’re using a 7-week delay.
Tonight’s the night! The premiere of Joan &amp; Melissa: Joan Knows Best? Take a look at this sneak peek and clips. http://t.co/0MANYvtThS #JKB
You do not want to miss an all-new @e_fashionpolice tonight at 10pm on E! with our special guest @RedFoo from @LMFAO. http://t.co/Cc3DuC3ZZP

Reading about all those people stranded aboard the Carnival Triumph. The passengers on the Titanic had a better time on their trip.
Been reading about the murder charges facing Oscar Pistorius. I hope it doesn't make it to trial...he doesn't have a leg to stand on.

On my way to @LateNightJimmy to do his show tonight. Can't wait! Tune in at 11:35pm to hear about season 3 of JKB (starting Feb. 23 at 9pm)
I totally understand why the Pope resigned. I’d be furious too if they made me work on Christmas and Easter.
Any questions for me during Red Carpet season??? Ask me through this link and I'll answer next week!! http://t.co/2m6z6zqq
@realDonaldTrump @sassy_grunch @ApprenticeNBC Yes, seriously!

Thrilled to be an ordained minister, but I’m also a performer – every wedding I officiate has a cover charge and a two-drink minimum.

Getting Ready to watch the red carpet at the Grammys on E! Don't forget, tomorrow at 9pm is our @e_FashionPolice Grammy special. Tune in!!!
Tonight, the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word should definitely go to "The Crazy Deposition of Lady Gaga Regarding Her Former Assistant."
Tomorrow's Grammy Awards’ dress code says talent is not allowed to show any ass. Does this mean Rihanna has to leave Chris Brown at home?

Saturday 2-3am EST on @QVC's Hello Spring Style Accessories Event. David Dangle will feature my Sequin Stretch Shell! http://t.co/Vy5NZ6gG

I'm hitting the road with LOTS of comedy dates this Spring. I might even be coming to your town! Visit http://t.co/d4rlZ3Sw for all my shows
I truly hope that the Boy Scouts’ ban on gays will be lifted. Young men will finally be able to earn their merit badges in jazz hands.

It’s Super Bowl Sunday and the world is more obsessed about the fate of one little ball than Lance Armstrong before his operation.
You can still watch this week's @e_FashionPolice and see how I destroy the competition during our "Fashion Bowl." http://t.co/o7QCMuwO
The Super Bowl reminds me of “Dynasty.” It’s a bunch of very wealthy people trying to outmaneuver each other in big shoulder pads.
Don't forget to tune in tonight to our @e_FashionPolice Fashion Bowl episode with special guest @AdamPally. 10pm on E! http://t.co/kr0696VL
The Super Bowl may be Sunday, but tonight is the @e_FashionPolice FASHION BOWL! You don't want to miss this crazy competition - 10pm on E!
What will be different now that the Boy Scouts are allowing gays? The neckerchief will be worn sticking out of the back left pocket.
Met the wonderful @KimColes last night. Go see her here in NYC at @BeechmanTheatre http://t.co/3zSnsiJj http://t.co/4UTQTQ5W
Sad about the death of Ed Koch. I interviewed him and had dinner with him many times. He was a great mayor and THE quintessential New Yorker

Saving the best shot for last! Thank you @charlesbushfoto for a great 2 days! http://t.co/rbelaUUg
I think this Sunday's Super Bowl would appeal to me if instead of a football they played the game with a Gucci purse.
Attention NYC! I’ve added a show next Tuesday, February 5 at 8pm @BeechmanTheatre. Get your tickets before we sell out! http://t.co/HKEBm9uB
@hifive230 already did that one!

As you can see, Max is a good patient - following the doctor’s orders and drinking his water so he flushes them out. http://t.co/QKzQAsEC
Update on my dog, Max. The good news is that the ultrasound showed he’s not pregnant! The bad news: He has kidney stones.
In response to criticism that their "Footlong" sandwich only measures 11 inches, Subway will now bake its bread with a pinch of Viagra.
So worried! Came home to Max feeling sick. He had to have an ultrasound to see what's wrong. Fingers crossed, everyone. http://t.co/TRVyQmBE
Somehow, the word "fucking" slipped through on @e_FashionPolice. It shouldn't have happened, but whoopee! That's how the joke was written.

It’s @MelRivers ‘s birthday! I gave her the gift of life. I think she’s now waiting for the gift of inheritance. Happy birthday! I love you!

Attention! Never invite goody-two-shoes Taylor Swift to your Christmas party. She spikes your vodka with eggnog.
The best Christmas gift you can give Lindsay Lohan is Monopoly. She doesn’t play board games but she needs the "Get Out Of Jail Free" cards.
Heard that NBC might replace Jay Leno with Jimmy Fallon. Apparently they’re ready to try something new on the Tonight Show…humor.
