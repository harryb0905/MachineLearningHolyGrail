@keiopensdoors ayyyyyeee 💫
@NJinLA @keiopensdoors @SaintHeron It was and I’m so grateful u were there. (I was so nervous and weird tho, lol) I sometimes want stuff to stay in those “safe spaces” but am gonna remember this exchange and do better at releasing them into the world❤️
@NJinLA @keiopensdoors @SaintHeron With that being said. I didn’t and couldn’t do it ALL on my own and through my direction have been blessed to have an amazing crew of ppl who bring it all to life. I try to credit them always (via ig mainly) and so appreciate their contributions. All love! And thank u again ❤️
@NJinLA @keiopensdoors @SaintHeron I say this only because I think it’s important for women, especially woc women artist to stand by their work and creations in a world that often hands it to other ppl. I really appreciate having this dialogue, and really hope you understand my need to clarify:)
@NJinLA @keiopensdoors @SaintHeron Griffin Frazien was the amazing co- architect on Metatrons Cube. I designed, sketched out and conceived the cube (those sketches have been posted) and he actually made it come to life contributing his own additional incredible elements.
@NJinLA @keiopensdoors Armina and I collaborate on creative direction and art direction for @SaintHeron projects and she recently curated, art designed and KILLED the Coldest Winter installation and created her own sculptures (which are my fave in the world:)
@NJinLA @keiopensdoors Armina Mussa is THE most brilliant artist in her own right, and one of my best friends, but does not contribute to any of my stage performances or sculptures. I’m sorry, this is my baby and I’m sensitive about my shit lol.
@NJinLA @keiopensdoors 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 ??? Lol I’m curious ?
Hi! I designed this set, sketched it out....creative directed the show , choreographed and musical directed it, Griffen Fraizen rendered my sketches, and the incredible John Torres brought my lighting design to life ! Holla at a playa lol. https://t.co/WgEaR6xkc2

@ImTheMainTalk I’m working on it! The sculpture is modular and can be rebuilt on site (in about 24 hours) so that peeps can interact with it however they’d like:)
@NokwandaThemba Yes! The metatrons cube also uses the flower of life to map creation of all living things ... I’ve been really appreciative of the guidance sacred geometry has lended to me ❤️

Metatronia explores the process, and mapping of creation. The piece is an exercise on following the intuitive force that guides us, helping us to create space, and silence the mind to create the work. https://t.co/VYOVKWPDP8 https://t.co/czhXocJDiC
