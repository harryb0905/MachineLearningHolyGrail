Kimberly you are one of one! Thank you for doing what is right in this world! Even if it’s not the “cool” thing to do. Thank you for doing what is in your heart no matter how many people go against you! You truly are an angel!!   I am so proud of you! Ms Alice is FREE!!! #KUWTK
Ms Alice called Kimberly her “war Angel” before she even knew she was released! #kuwtk

I love these insider moments from the MET gala #KUWTK
We are still working on it! It is coming and it is being documented #KUWTK https://t.co/powwgsIFUB
Mommy guilt is real! I never understood it until I became a mother. And leaving her for just 48 hours was so incredibly hard for me. I know that’s dramatic because we all have to work, but it really takes time to adjust. I’m still adjusting lol #KUWTK
My Good American performance launch! I still can’t believe Good American has athletic wear! Such a huge accomplishment for me!!! #KUWTK
@bIairwadolf Babe don’t say that!! You are such a blessing to this world and to so many people! I love you!!! You are deserving of everything beautiful

Wait.... @kourtneykardash if I sent you the nicest text you’ve ever received… Shouldn’t you reply back to that? Buuuurrrrnnnnnnn
@Khlocaine_ Hahahaha I already did mine and I can’t diss baby True like that. But in like a week remind me and I will totally change it again! I need to start changing it more
@kyliestuffs Thank you so much for reminding me! I literally forget to do that kind of stuff

@Sept_Sunsh1ne Always true
@vindictivesoph SAME!!! My happy place
@ChaoticKitt_n @RevengeBody The show is for people to find their path on their own. I point them in the right direction but they have to prove to themselves that they have the power within. It was always within them. I just gave them a nudge. It’s unrealistic for me 2Bthere and then what after 🤷🏼‍♀️ failure?
@tyraeliiizabeth Hahaha my baby True really doesn’t but im@hoping her personality will
@TheJazzyType Which one love?

@EdgarSinahiRod @KrisJenner @KimKardashian @kourtneykardash Wow thank you!!!
@Cpena2020 Awwwww thank you gorgeous ❣️❣️
@danac311 Yes I tried literally EVERYTHING!! doctors came to check, I met with the lactation specialist, I did power pumping, I drink the tea, ate the cookies, did special massages etc. it just wasnt working for me. Once True started loosing weight bc of it. I had to give her formula
@Tiffany36608237 Oh my goodness same birthdays and same last names
@ashton_r_smith 💋💋💋
@KeeTheBeauty_ I’m normally always ready for war. I was definitely in shock and so defeated emotionally that I just wasn’t in a place for it. So I appreciate that she was! #KUWTK
@janetcology I love you babe!! You’re very right 💜
@twinveganspdx @RealTristan13 Lol got it! Lol your issue is with the fur! You clearly don’t know Tristan or myself so you have no idea our timeline babe. But I’m so flattered that you pay such close attention to me for all of these years 🥂 to the great life love. Thanks for the support
I want to shout out @RichYoungin for driving me to the hospital and for videotaping most of the footage! He may have been annoying me during my contractions but WO him we would not have most of this footage! Obviously once I started going into labor, one of the girls took over
@lisaolukunle In my opinion just try to stay as calm as possible and try to have a peaceful environment. I got an epidural so I’m suggesting that but I know everybody has their own opinions
@kyIiegurl Oh my heart!!!! 😍😍😍
@twinveganspdx @RealTristan13 What are you even talking about. Their son was born December 12th these images were taken many months later. And baby girl, i have been wearing those rings way longer than I’ve known TT. Get your facts straight
That conversation was WILD!! Lol it was crazy but my family has every right to express how they feel and they did just that! He chose to make this so public sooooo what does he expect #KUWTK
Kim is THAT b*tch #KUWTK
But I didn’t realize it until last weeks eoiside lol #kuwtk
I was definitely and completely in shock #KUWTK
@narcicismo Hahahahaha it’s a beautiful thing! I wish I had the no drinking syndrome #KUWTK
Honestly I don’t know if any other human being as this excited to go to their high school reunion! This makes me so happy #KUWTK
@MyleezaKardash She’s a pussy when it comes to alcohol. Everything else she’s a beast!
@narcicismo As she should! Blooooppppp
@coralreef_____ For realllssss
A birth is not something you can “redo”. Once you make that choice you can never get it back #KUWTK think big people ❣️ https://t.co/yomGzrFZcc
Regardless of what Tristan did to me, I was never going to take that moment away from True or Tristan. She should not be punished for his actions. He is her father and they both deserve to love one another as deeply as They possibly can #KUWTK
My god did Kimberly have a sip of alcohol? Wow big deal #KUWTK
I’m so happy Keeks went to her reunion #KUWTK
I made it very clear that I was still disgusted by his actions but I wasn’t going to let ANYTHING ruin this moment I’ve been waiting for my ENTIRE life #KUWTK
I love my sisters more than anything else in this world and I completely respect and honor their opinions. But they were not there when I started going into labor and I told Tristan what I wanted for the delivery room.
@brieanamae23 ❤️❤️❤️
@karvandergriff Oh my gosh! Now you are just flirting with me… LOL oh my God I feel like I’m looking at a beast but I did just give birth 🙃
@___cookj Awwww thank you so so much!!! She’s my angel!! Literally she is
@ink_nails I’m so sorry love!!!!
I tried breast-feeding for weeks and weeks! For me it was so painful but I also was not producing a lot of milk. So I had to pump every time she was napping. I guess due to stress my milk was not coming in. I tried and I just couldn’t give her enough. So I had to go to formula. https://t.co/3ohDLsa1RU
I can’t believe I had to deal with this disgusting crap still in the hospital room ! 😡🤬 #KUWTK
You all definitely did!!! I love our big ass family #KUWTK https://t.co/YLeq0BKY3C

I am praying for everyone affected by the fires. Stay safe everyone ❤️
So thankful for the heroic firefighters and first responders who are out here fighting the #WoolseyFires and doing everything in their power to save our lives, our pets, our homes and our communities. We are all safe and that’s what matters 🙏🏼

@OutxMiles Ok now you make a good point. Ugh my heart can’t handle much more
This entire situation is devastating! From the structures that have been destroyed, to the animals abandoned. People who have lost their lives. It’s simply unimaginable 😖
Y’all know I have a special place for giraffes in my heart! All animals but I am being told that all animals from Malibu wines safari are safe!! I didn’t think they would do that to Stanley. That’s a fake report https://t.co/SY1Majq1ae
@Khlocaine_ Thank you!!!!
Thank you!!! Praise the Lord! I feel terrible for all of the animals https://t.co/9dUMLnhoVb
Please confirm this! Oh my gosh! I pray Stanley is ok https://t.co/mLRNVjuEeL
I have to find out if Stanley (the giraffe 🦒) is ok and if I can help in any way. Oh I feel terrible for him. He’s probably so scared and confused!!!
No way! Is this real?!?! No fucking way they would do this?!?! 😡🤬 https://t.co/B8Tg8376Oj

I have not stopped praying and watching the news! May God protect us ALL https://t.co/9muYGQDdxN
I can’t believe this is happening!!! May God bless us all! I can not believe what is happening! Completely devastating for anyone who loses tangible memories and the security of their homes. Thank you to EVERYONE who has a hand in helping. I’ve never seen anything like this
I have this on but I’m getting no notifications but the reports I’m getting from the news tell a different story https://t.co/oholC93iWY
Fuck! The flames have jumped the 101!! I need an evacuation update please 🙏🏽🙏🏽

@neverletyoupart Thank you love! I appreciate that! But HE made it public. Not us. So I had to publicly deal with all of this SMH
@HereisKristan Wow!!! Bless you!! Thank you
@fastfuriousdiva Thank you love!!!
@Teresa50713924 Ugh I have to relive it more next week lol 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
@QueenCB4 The cameras weren’t with me in Cleveland thank God 😈😈😈
@kourtneykardash @DashDolls831 You are my life kourt!!!!!! You are my everything
strong for True.  I waited for this day for so many years! I know now, looking back that I was in shock because I couldn’t believe that this would ever happen to me but I’m still very proud of myself for how I handled everything. True gave me the peace and strength I needed
I know this! I chose to put my feelings aside for the birth and to try and have as much positive energy that I could. My only thought was about the birth of my daughter. I wasn’t going to let ANYONE disrupt anything less than what she deserved. Joyous love. I chose to be mature &amp;
I wanted to have a beautiful birthing experience for myself and for the memories of what I choose to share with True when she’s older. I want her to have videos and pictures of her daddy there, holding her etc. I want her to know she is LOVE and my happiness! Babies feel energy!
These poor ladies on skype were probably thinking my mom was CRAZY #KUWTK
@ChamarLatanja Oh well thank God a camera was NOT with me in Cleveland!!! I won’t put in writing what I did but let’s just say he’s LUCKY I was9 months pregnant 😏
@ChristinaAllDay Lol we all need a little MJ in our lives
@TNastek She’s perfect

I love you keeks!!! Thank you for EVERYTHING #KUWTK
@itsKELSEYtho The best!!
@Lioness_Zion Ugh that was a hard hard interview to do. I still remember the pain of that. But God prepared me for this and gave me strength so my baby True wasn’t affected. I was strong enough to put my feelings aside so she only felt love!! Nothing else
She doesn’t have a choice! She is lol https://t.co/Go1rwyRI0w
Same https://t.co/xT4mLDCqDf
I can’t believe Kylie thought she would hurt my feelings 😩 I needed to see what was happening and better from my family then by someone else #KUWTK

Oh my God my heart is racing! So crazy how emotions never die! You may forgive but forgetting is not possible #KUWTK

@TalkingToPaige Hahaha baby, I’m about to get pissed again too! Lol you are talking me down

@noemikardash Hahahahaha that’s exactly me! No jumping lol
No lol my mom is just busy I think so she forgets lol I’m hoping #kuwtk https://t.co/J7dWf2HGbP
I could never ever sky jump!!! I rarely say never but I’m pretty confident about this one
@KimKDelRey @theholykardash Completely! And that’s the problem and maybe the network programming which is done months in advance
@KimKDelRey I know! It’s not in our control. I wish we aired in real real time but I’m not sure what needs to happen to do that
I miss my pregnant belly!!! Can’t believe I’m saying this lol
I love filming for the show and I am proud that we are all strong and brave enough to be vulnerable BUT we have to start airing shows closer to real time. This episode is about 7 months old and it’s a lot to relive all over again But maybe I need to 🤷🏼‍♀️
I appreciate and love you all MORE than you know!!! We are ALL allowed to have our feelings in this! https://t.co/YchbsR5Q4b
My cutie Malika, is always by my side #KUWTK
Scott is the best
@amberedenharris @khloefandotcom Wow!!! Thank you!!! Pass it on 💕💕
I love you guys!!! Thank you for EVERYTHING you do for my soul! Everything is how you look at it. As toxic as social media can be, it can also be a beautiful supportive platform. Thank you 💜
@bIairwadolf 💜❤️💜❤️💜
I will see how much I can handle. This goes for tonight AND next week https://t.co/DeMG25fWSO
Remember that you are never alone in your pain, and that everything is temporary. Pain, joy, elation, panic, anxiety, it is all temporary. Be grateful for the experiences that continue to build character, and make you who you are. https://t.co/SLTrmua3DP
Amidst the tough times, I have been blessed with the ultimate gift, my sweet baby True who has changed my life in ways I never could have imagined.
To relive these moments all over again is incredibly difficult emotionally but I also hope that with every trail, tribulation and curve ball life throws at us, that we ALL get to learn from our journeys.
Tonight’s episode is an uncomfortable and super emotional one for me, but when we signed up for this show over a decade ago, we signed up for a reality show, which meant showing you guys inside our lives, the good, the bad and the ugly.
@Aussie_Kardash @Khlocaine_ Thank you 🙏🏽

@amberoniie So interesting how the world works at times. Right?
@Tumi0209 So much love back
@TrulyAKhloeKFan I love you! Im beyond thankful for you and your love
@rooharper Amen ❤️
@thesearchforan2 Thank you for this 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
@thisistheresaX That’s a horrible thing to say but this is  your opinion which you may have. You know nothing about my sisters and their hearts. But your outlook on life or others lives will only affect you in yours. May love be with you always.
It was not but it’s not about the sister or person. You’re missing the point. I’m better than I was years ago but still everyday have to work on me (if I choose) I was pointing out that just the other day I snapped and I hated it after the fact. I can always be better. https://t.co/5jsR9bcOj1
@khloefandotcom We are together babe! Never ever that. We are family over everything always
I’m rambling now, but I simply wanted to remind us all that our past does not define us. Knowledge is power! Self awareness is beautiful! We all should be growing /progressing every single day! I am not the woman I was 5 months ago, 5 years ago etc... thank God for that!
And please, by all means I’m not saying I’m super zen/perfect. Im saying that I believe in us constantly evolving. Recently, I responded to my sister in a super defensive way bc she hurt me so I snappped back. I want to get to a place where ones actions don’t effect my own.
Allow yourself to listen to friends and family. Hear them when they try to help you. As long as we live there will be something more to learn.  And as long as we follow our hearts and never stop evolving, we shall never turn older, but newer and more compassionate every day.
There will never be a stage of life that does not contain new ways of evolving if you are open to being honest with your faults. Don’t be embarrassed of them, be proud you are admitting to them and simply TRY to be a better version of youself.
I hated the way I used to react to people or how I would speak to some. I’m still and forever a work in progress. That excites me!! Never am I working towards perfection because what is perfection anyways? Simply aiming to be better, With every stage of my life.
Be patient, tough and have faith. Someday ur pain/struggles will be useful to you. Don’t be afraid to fall apart or fail. Cuz, 1day, the situation will open an opportunity for you to grow and rebuild yourself into the brilliant person you are capable of being.
Im thankful for every moment I have! I didn’t used to be present enough to truly reflect on the beauty of it all! The highs, lows. I was simply going through the motions of life! Im thankful that I’m in a place where I truly appreciate every experience. Good, bad or indifferent
@Andy The flirting will get you EVERYWHERE with me 😘
@khloefandotcom I love you 💕😘
@DashDolls831 I love housewives! Are used to be able to watch when the show is airing but now with the baby I don’t get to watch it in real time. But I definitely record them all and watch when I can. I’m behind right now but I love the series
@kyIiegurl Oh my goodness you have no idea what you guys do for me! I love you all so deeply
@noemikardash Happy happy early birthday! May you be constantly surrounded by blessings and beautiful things! You have so much life ahead of you! Enjoy every minute of it
@NeveKardashian @GraceKardash Oh my gosh this made me so happy! Hi beautiful girls
@kardashcans Hi beautiful! That just means when we talk it gets to be more special because it’s more rare LOL
@isamendesxo I am so sorry!! I really am! I heard a lot of hate crimes are taking place and that makes me so incredibly sad! I do not know why so much evil exists but I also know that we still have so much love surrounding us. Sometimes it doesn’t seem that way but we do!
@narcicismo I completely agree! Everybody has their own bubble witch they live in and no one should apologize for the life that they have. But we have a human responsibility to be aware of what’s happening in our world and hopefully do what we can to make it better or two at least educate
@DashDolls831 @BravoWWHL @Andy My sisters and I were just saying we haven’t done a trio sister interview in years! And we think we want to do with Andy soon
@Ross_Kardash @kuwtkhloek Wowwwwww!!! I’m so so proud of you!!!!!!!!!!
@narcicismo We are so great!! We are out of the country right now so the time difference is so crazy. But we are so in love with one another LOL or maybe I’m just in love with her LOL
@DashDolls831 So much back to you !
@DramaKing25 So much love to you babe
@NeveKardashian I love you thank you so much for saying that
@godskendall I’m sorry love!!! Pray and continue to be good!! Love and goodness will get you far. Evil will never prosper
@kuwtkhloek My baby nurse is Brazilian, she was explaining the situation to me. It’s so sad! I love learning about other countries but it’s just craziness what’s happening in our world. We have to remember to be good hearted people because even one person can make a difference. Praying 4all

@khloeroses All are stunning! I love the black and the burgundy options. I think burgundy is probably the winner because black is most likely what other people will be wearing and that deep wine color is so beautiful on your skin

@kardashwjenner I love you
@destinyyy31286 We need to learn to praise all skin tones/ethnicities! Our beauty is in our differences. We can learn so much! So proud of every human who is confident in who they are. I’m in my 30s I think I’m just finding this confidence. So I am patient with others. But allow me to voice mine
I love you more than you will EVER know!!!!
💕💕💕💕💕💕
@narcicismo Cancer for life!!!! (Obvi)
@DashDolls831 @robkardashian Robbbbbbbb I love you !!!!
@thejakekardash @Khlocaine_ Lol I will when it’s time lol
@ItsJorgeAcosta We will not be defined by social media. And I don’t mind the critics but please just stick with what you have to say. Dont erase
@njkardashian I love you
@narcicismo Listen True has changed me like crazy!!! I’m thankful! But sometimes I do want to stunt on these hoes lol
@thejakekardash Bloooooop
@Khlocaine_ But don’t push me
@Khlocaine_ That was the old me but I’m really trying to remain the new me lol
@DashDolls831 Same lol
@narcicismo I love what you red. It’s right! But it takes time for us to understand and to be that calm and compassionate. We all, as humans needs to grow and evolve. Life lessons teach us that. I’m proud of us
@MyleezaKardash I’m also really annoyed because I spoke so calmly and eloquently when normally I am rash and fucking aggressive lol
@narcicismo I try to put myself in their shoes &amp;maybe they were brought up in a different type of household then I was. So instead of shaming I try to educate. In our household we do not see color. We see emotion and action. We see love. We feed off of energy
@DashDolls831 I truly love educating others and hopefully opening up their minds to a beautiful collective world. But some people are not willing to except anything else then what they know
@Khlocaine_ Everyone is entitled to their opinion‘s and I’m not complaining about that. please state your opinion but allow me to State mine.
I dislike the fact that people are allowed to comment on my daughters skin color but as soon as I comment kindly back and praise her for all that she is, the comment gets erased. If you have the courage to post your nasty criticism please allow one to defend or comment back

Loosing the first 30 lbs of baby weight was not as challenging as I thought it would be for me. I think me learning my body prior to my pregnancy helped a lot. But now I’m plateauing and it’s sooooo hard to get this baby weight off of me! Ugh any tips guys?

@KimKWestPics @khloekedit Wow!!! That’s messed up!! They really are money hungry monsters
@khloekedit That’s sooooooo bizarre!! I would assume if you give them credit they would let you guys use them. I wonder if there’s another way around this
@Khlocaine_ @kuwtkhloek That’s lame AF. Well I’ve been literally sued and has to pay a lot so it’s whack a fuck!! So strange because how can they be mad at everyone for posting? Literally sooooo many people do it
@waveskylie @kuwtkhloek That’s fucked up!! I wonder how people can post then? It’s so bizarre
@Khlomoney98 @kuwtkhloek That’s crazy!!!!!
@dzurinko @kourtneykardash Oh my god!!!! I could never ever forget this day! That was the most uncomfortable day ever! But a great experience LOL I can’t believe she let us film that
@PlanetKhloeK RIGHT!!! They can legally stalk me and harass me and then on top of it all I can’t even use the pictures of myself they take LOL what the fuck is this
@brexcxdh @serena_adriana I’m newer to the eco friendly world but I’m really trying
@AyoLysha Always!!
@khloekedit Why are they getting deleted? Because you guys are posting paparazzi pictures? And they want you guys to give them credit or to pay for them? I don’t really understand
@kuwtkhloek Who is reporting? Paps? Wtf why?
Yes!! I have to license some of the images first. A paparazzi sued me in the past for reposting an image of MYSELF. So now it just takes me a little longer because I have to go and license the images so they don’t get my 💰 MAKES NO SENSE. https://t.co/GNUWUWUxZl

Mommy shamers r at a high right now. I’m sick, at a charity event &amp; I’m getting slack 4being here bc I have a baby? Her dad is watching her while I’m trying 2bring awareness 2an amazing organization. But either way, what’s wrong w a new mom letting daddy take over 4a few hours?
Have to get off Twitter. It’s making me nauseous typing and being in the car 🤧🤢😩On my way to the Forum to play poker for The City Of Hope! 🙏🏽
@bri_berry347 That’s a very good point!!! You are spot on!!! Thank you for the knowledge 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 ❤️❤️
She’s so fucking gorgeous https://t.co/H1wdAY4jT0
🙌🏽🙌🏽 https://t.co/pwfFt3axlV
@MillerShannon95 @bri_berry347 Thank you for sharing with me! ❤️❤️
@Arii__2001 Yes He did!!!!!
@dbbunny122 @extratv Thank you 😊
@BlinkParanormal Awwww thank you!!! It’s beautiful but it means a lot because it’s a family name too
@buck_josie Hehehe
@williamsdana29 Lol I know!! Eventually I want to get another puppy but you’re so right. They are like newborns
@thatgal_bamm Really? What does that do
@maispuro I have actually have one somewhere !! Smart!! I’ll find it and use it
@bri_berry347 So I’m getting mixed information on this. Ugh I don’t know what to do
@ShellySvee No feet too??? This is torture!! But I would literally cry if I got my angel sick. Wow I would be so mad at myself
Ugh I HATE being sick!! But I hate even more I can’t kiss my baby right now. Maybe just her feet?? 🤷🏼‍♀️😷🤧
Hell no!! Lol i’m still working on it. And it will come in time… I hope LOL but sitting down I have a completely different stomach then I used to have LOL I really can’t even talk about it https://t.co/dSMtr529zM
@Sarah_Lou_Merry I’m so blessed that for keeping up I can take her with me (if it Doesn’t affect her schedule) but for design meetings or photo shoots or when I start shooting revenge body again it’s not really a place for her to be. But that’s OK because I get so excited when I see her!!!
@tiffid19 Oh my goodness 🤦🏼‍♀️
@Cokzario You are so right! And I hope in time the guilt will go away. The only times I’m away from her is if I’m working. (Or unless she’s sleeping and I go to a late dinner) So I have to keep reminding myself that I’m working to provide for her future. But ugh the guilt is real
This is so true! Body after baby is definitely not the same. My body… Will it ever go back to normal LOL it’s a mindfuck https://t.co/wwYC8UFQSO
@moonpeachh No no no. I can’t even think about this
The worst part is the mom guilt. It’s a real thing. You feel guilty at all times if you have to leave her side. Or really for anything. The best part is everything about her! The unconditional love and the fact that I get to raise a beautiful, strong and intelligent young lady https://t.co/S1H7dJHpY2
@Stepherrz What a beautiful tweet!!!! You’re so sweet love!!!! Congratulations
@tash_kardash It’s not as terrifying as it once was LOL at least I pray it’s not

@mscoco1224 Congratulations to you too!
@CINDY_0788 The teenage girl part I don’t think I’m that excited about LOL I remember how I was as a teenager… Oh my goodness! Thank God I have a couple years to prepare for this
@JazzyBtooSexy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@brittany_bendik People normally think I’m crazy when I answer so honestly LOL but it’s my life and this is how I feel at the very moment
@monicadavis101 Great advice!!!
@Adrix_Garza Four!!  Congratulations mommy!
@jadeemadison I was looking for this Cuban coffee in LA and I can’t find any. It’s literally the best caffeine rush of all time
@RainaRain69 Maybe you’re right. I’m close with the girls but I guess I have more of a masculine energy? I like sports and I’m more rough. I’m not that frilly and delicate LOL but now I talk in this annoying baby voice and I want everything pink. I don’t know what happened to me LOL
@Ietsariana @ArianaGrande Oh my god I mean.... angelic!!! She’s incredible
@monicadavis101 6 kids!!! God bless you mama!!! You have the perfect balance of children! Three and three! What a strong woman you are
@JazzyBtooSexy Thank you so much for this sweet tweet! Honestly that’s so nice of you to say! I love her so much and I still think it’s crazy that I am actually a mom LOL
@DeanaK1 Hahaha oh goodness really?!?! Lol well grown men are bigger babies than woman so this doesn’t really surprise me lol

ANDDDD she has her two cousins to be her besties. We call them the triplets 👶🏽👶🏽👶🏽 it’s just the cutest!! GOD IS GREAT
@chelseat72 This warms my heart! I pray True does the same thing with her special song
I wanted a boy so badly Because Mason and I are so close. I love our bond. I felt confident in having a boy but God blessed me with my precious True and now I wouldn’t know what to do with a boy. True has made me sweeter and more gentle. God gives you what you need.  My BFF 4Life
@chelseat72 Oh good!!!! Thank you for this 💕
@itsDeviCarter Of course!! I love switching up my hair. I’m doing a short weave today. I don’t want to cut my own hair soooooo I’ll fake it

My sister Kim sent me this video😩Watch https://t.co/q0O8JCJ1pB
Oh my goodness! My sincerest apologies! Thank you for telling me Mx. Asia!! 💕 ok now I guess I’ll just be waiting by my TV until season 4 https://t.co/qrmdJo7TNZ
@elenawonders It’s suuuch betrayal. Almost something Bobby would do LOL #Billions
@briankoppelman I cannot fucking wait! I don’t know why I was so shocked by the last episode. I should’ve seen it fucking coming. And now I have to wait for season four. Time is moving slowly
@elenawonders I loooove Taylor!! I do! I was so invested with her and Bobby together as a team and I really thought they were going to dominate even more than they have. I think I was shocked because I was so surprised by that move
@MsDianneMary Amen! God bless you and thank you
@in2iti0n44 @stephie_baybie Thank you for sharing your story with me and for being so honest! Congratulations to being a great mommy and to your beautiful babies
@babrooks1239 Awwwww thank you love! ❤️❤️
@joshua_hudson7 So sweet love!!!! Thank you 💜🦋💜🦋
Ughhhh I was so caught off guard by Taylor’s move! Now I’m on fucking pins and needles for season 4! Miss Asia, you don’t disappoint 💕🦋 https://t.co/yz7MdiG3fn
Fuck Taylor Mason! #Billions #Season4HurryUp

@KayshaMarie @stephie_baybie Oh my gosh I was the same!! I fought and fought to try and continue but then when I actually stopped, I didn’t realize what a relief it was for me to not stress and worry anymore. Any sec I had of downtime I was stressing to produce more for the next feeding
@Krisholz5 @stephie_baybie Same love!!!
@Tisha_Mary6 Lol I have too much time apparently lol
Ugh it wasn’t that easy for me. I tried every trick in the book- water, special cookies, power pumping, massages etc. I tried so very hard to continue. https://t.co/UYDjvbJHZg
If you are corny enough to believe something like this than you must have a very miserable and boring life. The fact that you felt the need to tweet me this already sheds light onto the kind of life you have https://t.co/KZzw0T8gUP

I haven’t been on Twitter in a couple days and I’m just catching up on a couple of tweets. I have so many people asking where I got that peekaboo elephant from. Isn’t it the cutest ever? It’s by Gund. I think it’s called flappy the elephant. Honestly it’s the cutest toy!!

@Rickimalus Just because I said I’m taking a bath and having some wine you think I don’t have stress? Silly rabbit lol this is why you’re stressed- you’re hating instead of doing something to DESTRESS your life. Change your energy and watch what happens
Honestly it’s amazing! Of course it’s an adjustment but it’s so beautiful! Sometimes I don’t know what day it is or I don’t get a shower LOL but she is finally on a great sleep schedule so I get adult time which is awesome! 🥂 https://t.co/2UpkjLEAkn

My little mama goes to bed at 8. So I have a few hours to enjoy “being an adult” but truthfully I would rather just stay home with her. But I tried last night lol https://t.co/ucoJdIOzFI
@khloefandotcom Thank you!!! Just was tired lol need to work on my tired smiling face
You make up anything!! I actually had a great night. It was a large birthday dinner for friends and as a new mom IM TIRED AF!! Being out past 10pm is not where I’ll have the most energy these days. https://t.co/mUMnvKdLno
I’m sharing my exact workout to get my body back!! Now you guys can do it too! https://t.co/LEaUjoPsfl
Do it for the gram! See my hottest spots for pics across the world! https://t.co/iluOqziD2W
There are thousands of children now separated from their parents and we must not let these children be forgotten, nor can we let this moment be forgotten. We have to do better than this. Please tweet, talk, call, post, write, donate. Xo https://t.co/NzC4JWZ1iS
Whether you believe that refugees should be allowed into this country or not, this is not how human beings treat each other. This is not how we foster love and acceptance. This is not who we are.
It has been heartbreaking to watch what has been going on at the border, and impossible to comprehend that we live in a country where children are torn from the arms of their parents, who are dealt the ultimate punishment for wanting a better life for their families.
As a new mommy, there is nothing in this world more important to me than my baby girl...
@harringtonn For real!!! It’s the only place I’ll drink it from. It’s so weird it tastes so good from there
@alysa_loves_you Awwwwwwww everyone here is amazing, kind and professional!! I feel so lucky to have such excellent people here ❤️❤️❤️
@Nikita90403772 It takes about a week of torture to finally find your rhythm! But then after week two it becomes a beautiful habit. Keep it up love
@alysafranc Large fries and a regular coke. Yummmmm
@Ashley74908378 It’s important to continue doing what you always did. I continued working out my entire pregnancy and my pregnancy was amazing. My labor was so fantastic and easy and I hear because I stayed healthy and active! Congratulations and God bless
@lovingmygil26 You will get there!!! It’s so fucking hard and frustrating at first. But it took nine months to create our Angels, we have to be patient together. It’s all so hard but trust me it will happen
@celestemtorres I struggled fir the first two weeks. It’s so hard to get back to working out. I still struggle but I feel so much stronger. Stay with it!! I believe in you!
Happy #NationalSelfieDay!!! XOXO – Koko &amp; Kylie 💋https://t.co/QJzguCGxN1
@Robin_on_here It’s all I love in but holy cow I’m eager to put a sexy dress on lol but I just don’t feel right yet. Leggings hold my tummy in so I love it
I’m sure the McDonald’s run didn’t help the other day but it’s what my hang over needed lol life is all about balance
I feel great that I’m back to working out! My body has a ways to go but I’m completely fine with that. I just wish I knew how to dress my body at the moment. I’m insecure w how big my lower half is at the moment so I’m not sure how to dress lol but everyday I’m closer to my goal
I felt good today snapping my workouts again. My form and endurance aren’t where they used to be but I’m slowly getting there. Who else is on a fitness mission?

Dieting is great but dieting doesn’t typically create long lasting results. I also believe that working out is so incredibly healthy and should be done to each individuals own rhythm of life. There’s no one size fits all when health and fitness.
I truly dislike when people report I’ve lost a tremendous amount of weight in a short amount of time or when people claim I’m doing these ridiculous diets. It’s really setting the wrong tone. I believe in making lifestyle changes when it comes to my food.

@TalentPioneer Who did I specifically call out? 🤔
@UniquelyMeloDee Perfectly said and I can understand that
@ForeverMalika You better live your best damn life!
Wild that people assume you’re speaking about something and they run with it. Anything and everything gets twisted into something it’s completely not. Lord, I’m remembering how much I loved my social media break LOL
Misery loves company… people can’t stand for someone else to flourish and be happy. Nowadays people thrive off ones downfall rather than their success. Sadly
They love to give advice but are not living the advice that they are offering. Most of the ones giving advice are in no place to give anything at all. Focus on your own world. I’m sure there’s cracks there that need your attention. We all got em
People spend too much time finding other people to blame, too much energy finding excuses for not being what they are capable of being. People these days are focused so much on someone else’s life instead of their own.

👑👑👑
@LoveKhloMoney Happy birthday love! Shine bright be continuously happy
@LorayneTejada Deep babe. Sad but true 👑👑👑 I love your crown
@narcicismo I try and take time to myself. I know it’s just a moment in time and those feelings will fade. I don’t like to project negative feelings on other people. So I try to stay to myself when I’m feeling like that. And watch something I listen to something that will change my mood
@DashDolls831 Very true
@BigBabyJonathan @PlanetKhloeK I am proud of the people who know it’s not for them
@sophiaasoliss 👑
@DanielKardash I’m proud of you
@luxealicious Well im a child of God so im always protected
@anna_renay 👑👑👑👑
@PlanetKhloeK It is simply because social media has made people in humane. They hide behind a computer screen and they don’t feel feelings anymore. I choose to always feel feelings and be aware of how I make others feel
@safetchick Keep your crown sparkling Queen
@danmurace Sometimes it’s good that that happens. You can’t stay stagnant to make other people comfortable. I’m proud of you for stepping outside of your comfort zone and evolving as a person
@4EverINAxo So sad Queen
We can ALL be successful and prosperous! We must all genuinely be happy for one another. Life is too short otherwise 💙 I want to see you excell! Let’s Inspire each other to evolve as people and be better
What happened to women fixing each other’s crowns instead of trying to knock the others crown off?
