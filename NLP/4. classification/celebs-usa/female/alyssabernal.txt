@arturowtf @McDonalds There’s this one girl who is ALWAYS rude and she pissed me off last night
It’s my man’s birthday! Send him some love 🖤🎉 @YoungDarias https://t.co/BqyTl30cpo
@JoshSussman @McDonalds Miss you man! Hope you’ve been well
@arturowtf @McDonalds It’s on White Ln in Bakersfield Ca.
@Sandyniner @McDonalds All she said was “oh shit, diid y’all want to replace that?” And then after like 25 mins of waiting in the parking lot the other rude employee just came out and handed us the burgers without even a sorry lol
@JoshSussman @McDonalds 🤮
Worst @McDonalds experience! 1st, the employee taking the order was rude. And then both our burgers were RAW! Not to mention the fries tasted like raw potatoes. We didn’t even get a “Sorry about that.” from the employees! If I get sick from this 😷😡 These are 2 diff burgers btw. https://t.co/C3Uxni5lhe
Is that really her 😳😳🙊🙊 https://t.co/E4N75zyksd

@pastyourbedtime It took a long time for me to find someone I could talk to about it and someone who would actually try to understand
One time I told my ex best friend I was depressed and she told me it was just “early signs of menopause”. Real shit. She was like “I’ve known you since 13 and you’re not depressed.” 😑 I could never talk to her about it. https://t.co/adnqt3QPgd

..move into my complex. It's hood as fuck and you'll have night terrors.
Or breathe! But I guess what's funny about the dream was that Adam Sandler was the shooter 🤣 but anyway, I guess what I'm saying is don't
I had a dream that there was a shooting in my complex and it was so realistic and terrifying and I woke up literally petrified. Couldnt move
..threatening my neighbor with a gun (clicking his unloaded gun at him) to the point where my neighbor had to move out). So the other night
Speaking of dreams. So a lot of shit has been going down at my apartment complex. Including a literal stabbing (murder) and a tenant..
