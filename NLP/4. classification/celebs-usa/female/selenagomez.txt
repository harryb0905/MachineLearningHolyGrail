:) RT: @DelenaNerds #getaway first you're telling us to "come &amp; get it" now you're telling us to "Getaway" haha! üòú
. @iflyselenagomez Ryan Gosling of course. LOL
. @HeckYesSelena It was an opportunity for me to learn a lot about technology and cars so that was fun.
. @HeckYesSelena: @selenagomez how was your experience filming #Getaway different than any other film you've been in?
. @sadserunade Yes, I cannot wait to make my next action movie.
. @OhPerfectSel No they shot most of the fast driving scenes before I got there, only when Ethan drove me around for a bit.
. @OhPerfectSel: @selenagomez @Getaway @Texasbeauty5 #Getaway were you scared during the extreme car rides?
. @DelenaNerds Yes! :)
. @HereForSMG_ The end of the movie because it is really Epic ending and I get to jump out of a car.
@HereForSMG_: @selenagomez @getaway what was your favourite scene to shoot? #Getaway
. @gomezfied All we really did off camera was go to McDonalds and sleep they were long days and we shot through the night.
. @jemmaselenator  being able to completely tranform myself and work with someone like Ethan.  I have always wanted to do an action movie.
@jemmaselenator: @selenagomez #Getaway what interested you in being a part of this movie? I love you so much!
. @lovatosgomez It depends on the scene, dramatic is more difficult I usually  like to be alone a couple of hours before.
