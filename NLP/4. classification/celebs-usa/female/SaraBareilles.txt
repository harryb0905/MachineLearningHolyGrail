One of a kind. Thank you Queen. #ArethaFranklin
@DeedeeMagnoHall @AlwaysInTheClub @ThePartyIsNow this is the best. I auditioned with A whole New World from Aladdin, and yes of course I owned the cassette tapes. I think I actually still have them. They were worn out I listened on repeaaaaatttttt
@JoeTippett till the other ones are ready this is the one I have to use.
Internet is spotty so I am returning to my reading, but I enjoyed the chat and thanks for all the cutie pie questions. I do love you, and I am grateful for the check in. xo
@abbiemregen don't forget to lean on people. share the pain and you might be surprised at who can hold it with you so it doesn't feel so heavy. you're doing great, darling. keep on.
@MauraPerson all of the above. Currently working on the record, and a tv show and then I would love to do something for the stage again. Also thinking of learning how to plank while not touching the ground. Unrelated, but worth mentioning.
@CaseyMGreer It's the number of steps from the back of the venue where I was standing to the stage where the person I wrote the song about was playing.
@MusicallyJay lists!! on paper. I make them all day long. then I lose them and then I find them and am constantly reminded of what I forgot to do last week/month/year. so... I guess never mind. Still working on it.
@alannahcran need to sort out record first, but touring is in the works! Trying to work out a food component to the show, as waitress/pie combo was v. successful. saraB/hardboiled egg combo is front runner now.
@mollyjgordon I brought twizzlers, cheez whiz, and a yam. so.. yes.
@saramegan omg. If only I could say. we will announce very soon. :)
@MJFrizzle Almost! It's a long process. 13 songs in. have to sing a litlte more. adding finishing touches. Mixes. artwork. all the good stuff. On its way. :)
@hannah616 White wine I guess. Or bubbly water if I'm not doing the drank.
on a flight. paid for internet. FOR THE WHOLE THING. Any questions?

I am so sad and feel so helpless about the families being separated. This is beyond inhumane...I am just appalled. I am grateful for those sharing how to engage and help, thank God for you. The idea that there is anyone who believes this is justice is simply heartbreaking.
I don't say this to engage ANYONE in any sort of vicious dialogue.Please don't. Not on my behalf at least. I don't believe in it. I DO believe in love, and Sunday night was a lighthouse of it... shine on sweet ones. Shine on. I send you love, @09GeorgiaGirl. That's all,Just love.
It's easy to shut down when we do not agree with each other.I do it all the time. I'm not proud of that. I'm working on it. But I remain so proud of the @TheTonyAwards and the message that it sent at large. I stand with this very American community in all it's diversity and soul.
Ignoring the overarching tone of the night is ignoring so much of the conversation that was had. Articulate. Intelligent. Supportive. Thoughtful. Passionate AND Compassionate. I was so very proud of this community, and I believe in and saw the integrity of its mission that night.
I truly wonder how you would come to this conclusion. We made high-minded, loving, intentional decisions to voice ideals of inclusion, community, and passion for the arts.  I understand there were some political comments made that upset some folks. Sunday was more that though. https://t.co/KygpN1R7jY

I will have to tend to this relationship with depression and anxiety for the rest of my life. I am gutted to see people take their own lives because it means they feel alone and hopeless. But things can change. You are not alone. Hope is mercurial too. Keep seeking it. #mystory
was almost too much to bear. I was encouraged by friends and I got help, and I have been in therapy for 10 years. It's part of my self care. I am not ashamed, I am a proud believer in the benefits of learning to understand our own darkness. I have learned enough to know that
I began my relationship with depression just after college. I didn't know what it meant at the time, but it's called disassociation: where my thoughts were louder than everything else, and i felt outside my body. I was terrified and felt alone and the idea of staying in the world
I wrote a letter and @BillboardPride is sharing it. #Pride https://t.co/lJDhsOSWjL

Yes. @nbc is hiring people for SEASON TWO OF @NBCRise 😍 #RISEAGAIN https://t.co/AfLClQpqqZ
This makes me miss TLC. #waterfalls #RISEAGAIN https://t.co/4PzQtrN0mp
AAaaaaannd this is my favorite tweet so far. You're a yes man, Dave. Thank you for that. #RISEAGAIN https://t.co/sJI2CHeR5Z
If this were my superpower I would be shit for the Avengers team, but sooo good for network tv shows. #RISEAGAIN @NBCRise @nbc https://t.co/ryjgDWUvnt
not a bad idea (self quoting... ahem) I have a great idea about a story line where I'm a kid who has been sleeping in the lighting booth and loves beans from a can and also has curly hair #RISEAGAIN https://t.co/E9o9i3vY1m
hahaha #RISEAGAIN https://t.co/ubnZyLraVD
Like what are we supposed to do, jump off the end of the season cliff and then not know if there's a parachute in the bag??? This is a bad analogy but for god sakes you get the point. #RISEAGAIN https://t.co/G0kX2SRudG
I'm intrigued by your twitter handle. #RISEAGAIN https://t.co/671KJubTsx

Most months only have 30 or 31 days in them, so I'm curious what calendar are you using and can I have one?  #RISEAGAIN @nbc @NBCRise https://t.co/G24ZeNqiwo
haha. I should not be in charge of myself. It's truly a mess. but maybe I would learn to handle things if @NBCRise had a second season. #RISEAGAIN @nbc #learning https://t.co/hJfI04WBmX
But I'm very busy trying to get #rise @NBCRise @nbc to cooperate with my wishes. #RISEAGAIN will pay more attention next week. xo https://t.co/uosKAsRVdN

I liked doing the cheers and eating sunflower seeds...let's be honest, I never knew what I would do with the ball had it ever come to me.

Go bunting!
Go Baseball!
