#PaidFamilyLeave is not a nationally mandated benefit in the US. 46 states leave the decision up to employers. However, only 15% of workers have access to #PaidFamilyLeave at their workplaces. We need a national #PaidLeave policy to ensure #FamilyBenefits for all in our country!
In 2016, 29.9% of children from homes in the lowest income bracket were physically inactive, compared to only 11.5% in the wealthiest households. We are working to make #YouthSports accessible to ALL children in America.
