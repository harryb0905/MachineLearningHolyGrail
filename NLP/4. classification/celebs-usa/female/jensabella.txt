@Varsa @TinaSfon Cool comment, bro.
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE MEN? https://t.co/zxztHlBG5T
It's overwhelming to fairly cover races where there are 10+ candidates. But ranking people based on how much money they have IS THE PROBLEM. There is too much $$ in politics, but we choose to give monied candidates more coverage.
Polling shows no clear frontrunner. So why do we as the media feel that we should be able to crown someone? The candidates need to do the work and build grassroots support. We don't need to do the work for them.
Never have been a big fan of newspaper endorsements but I will say the @Suntimes endorsing @LightfootForChi is refreshing. I was baffled when the media started covering Toni P. and Susana Mendoza as frontrunners the day they announced. Like, why? Who decides that?
Last night, I finished "Surviving R. Kelly" and felt sick to my stomach. So angry, so sad, so disappointed. Tonight, we'll talk through this horror show during a special edition of @GirlTalkChi with @Karnythia and @thewayoftheid. Come thru https://t.co/Qidckzsz1R
@joannaklonsky Love you, queen. 🥰
Jonathan has that magical "that's a story!" curiosity and hustle we value so much in our cult membe...errr reporters. He was somehow snagging great stories for us while in school and at another full-time gig. Very lucky to have him on board! https://t.co/DrdqcQUy6A

@MaxCollopy @chilandlord @mina_bloom_ @BlockClubCHI Hi hello covering elected officials is literally our job as a local news organization. Reporting on where our elected leaders get their money does not mean we're supporting people running against them. Frankly, that is an absurd argument.

@MisterJayEm This thread filled me with great joy. YOU RIGHT. I hate the whole "caring for animals is stupid because humans are in need" argument, too. We do what we can. I happened to have 10 cats in my yard when I moved in. So I did something to make them suffer less (and not reproduce).
@joannaklonsky 🤣🤣🤣
@JCB_Journo https://t.co/kPQ9FdsYKB
If you had a newspaper column, would you ever be so hard up for things to write about that you dedicate SEVERAL columns to ripping on people who care for feral cats? Things I'd rather read than this column: grocery lists, my own 9th grade poetry, nutritional information.
@wjmaggos @mariabustillos They definitely have advantages. BUT I think the combo of reader + (not necessarily giant, but smaller) foundation funding is worth exploring for more news orgs. At this point, very willing to try many things to keep our reporters employed, insured and covering local news.

@marianna_emh @hannahalani @BlockClubCHI I'm not sure because I've gone to them for ages. But I will say they are always SUPER up front about pricing.

@Paul_Biasco Him saying people are "late to the party" when the plan was released six days ago makes me want to SET MYSELF ON FIRE.
The plan was released SIX DAYS AGO. SIX DAYS. You are NOT late to any party, Chicago. Shaming people for giving a shit about how THEIR tax dollars are spent is SUPER classy. https://t.co/Txmq9dRXCh
Up to 50% of required affordable housing will be placed within 3 miles of Lincoln Yards, not on site. Wonder if that area will actually be "blighted"... 🤔 https://t.co/1xCbXLfNG1

@ourmaninchicago It's honestly my fave workout. @ellembee knows.
@ourmaninchicago How I feel when trying to talk to ANYONE about this lately: https://t.co/9pshzroMzZ
@AldermanHopkins Let’s just not make neighbors feel like they failed to get involved when in reality they never got a SINGLE chance to meet and discuss the plan that is going before the PC and radically transforming the city.
@AldermanHopkins It’s disingenuous to say there have been public meetings on the Sterling Bay plan for 3 years when in reality their master plan was released five DAYS ago. Neighbors aren’t urban planners, it’s hard to have an opinion without seeing a completed proposal and working from there.
Sadly feeling this so much lately: "Increasingly in Chicago, it feels like the only viable alternative to watching private development appropriate and adulterate that which the rest of the city holds dear is to set it on fire ourselves and watch it burn." https://t.co/zh1E4LlFzM
@god_offal . @AldermanHopkins hasn't responded to @BlockClubCHI's calls for more than a week. If we as journalists can't get basic questions answered, I'd imagine neighbors are pretty annoyed.
I'm sure there were plenty of closed-door meetings with developers and powerful politicians. But there were not three years of public meetings on this plan. How do I know? We covered 'em all.
The first public meeting on Lincoln Yards was in June of 2018, which was seven months ago. And public comment was not allowed https://t.co/lDhokYIjAY
Oh THIS is rich: Ald. Brian Hopkins keeps saying there have been public meetings for THREE YEARS on Lincoln Yards. This is FALSE. In 2016, folks were asked to "reimagine" the Finkl Steel site: https://t.co/C5eqykQvlL
"While the master plan, now in its third version, is getting better, its potential negative consequences — snarled streets, bland street facades and concealed park space — could be with us for decades. So what’s the point in rushing it to a vote?" https://t.co/q05nWWllHO
Remember when the city said it was moving Fleet Management to Englewood to "revitalize" the South Side? The South Side got garbage trucks and the North Side is getting $900 million in tax funds designated for "blighted" areas on prime riverfront property https://t.co/EFuiyLfTGS

I am notoriously bad at waiting until the last minute to buy Christmas gifts which is why we made sure to have these @BlockClubCHI gift certificates available for all you news-loving procrastinators. 🥰 https://t.co/mz7bXgQ1Az https://t.co/ZlXXhAwg0R
Another story from @BauerJournalism today using data from @ProPublicaIL's amazing Ticket Trap project. Kelly spoke to West Siders about their growing ticket debts: “The tickets keep doubling... I don’t know what I’m going to do.” https://t.co/aO5H77nPHV
@UTChicago @slulay2 HAHAHAHA! She got the same call and tried calling them back. 😂😂😂

HAPPENING NOW: King College Prep students threatened with expulsion, loss of scholarships for protesting new principal's policies, which they say have made the school feel like a jail. @JCB_Journo reports: https://t.co/bAldFzDabI
@evanFmoore Yeah, it's always fun when I'm accused of being an anti-police piece of shit and a pro-police propaganda pusher in the same week. 🙃
@UTChicago People are so cute and totally stable and this country isn't a hot mess at all. 🤣
Happy Thursday, everyone! 😊😊😊 https://t.co/d5SXj1vvML
Stoked to have @ProPublicaIL take over the @BlockClubCHI newsletter today to discuss their Ticket Trap project! @BauerJournalism + @AVHndzdug into their (amazingly comprehensive) data and found that the city’s two police-heavy wards get the least tickets https://t.co/dVecjOEMh9

DEADLINE FRIDAY for Englewood reporter position. https://t.co/lrt4zBPTAh
@laudis_world @mina_bloom_ @cdsa_lsc Curious to know who has more closely covered gentrification in these areas more than Mina and DNA/BCC. Set up a meeting before you trash a reporter publicly. This is beyond unproductive.
@mina_bloom_ @cdsa_lsc They weren’t picking on you, Mina. The anonymous writer just targeted you by name specifically even though for YEARS we were the only folks in town constantly covering these issues on a micro level and showing up to these press conferences. 🙄
@JCB_Journo We had one in our newsletter today because I uploaded the wrong photo and we've received SEVERAL smug emails about it that I've had to suffer through. 🙃
*put 😳
Thank you for this, AJ! Here's another good reason to pitch @BlockClubCHI first: we'll pay you FAST! Reminder for pitches --&gt; newsroom [at] blockclubchi [dot] org. If pitch is breaking, but 'URGENT PITCH' in subject line. Or text me. 🤷‍♀️ https://t.co/0jqeuBoMvi

I shouldn't just say "sad" — this is a great opportunity for Lee and we're so happy for him! &lt;3 We'll just miss him! 🥰
The sad news: @Mario_Demiuex, who has done an EXCELLENT job covering these neighborhoods is moving on to work with the great folks at @FreeSpiritChi. We wish him the best and can't wait to collaborate with the team he is leading there!

@tracyswartz @BlockClubCHI @BCC_WPB I SCREAMED when I saw this today - was thinking the same thing! Thankfully was able to get something up quickly thanks to the MOUNTAINS of history @BCC_WPB already reported.
@jbenton @vivian Since the crypto element was so unpredictable, we stuck with our own business plan based on USD and continue to pay reporters (we're actually hiring). Did I joke to my wife that I'd finally buy our Subaru if we got crypto rich? Yes. But we're saving for it like norms.
@jbenton @vivian Just throwing this out there, but from day one I did *not* want Civil or anyone else telling us how to run our newsroom/budget. They never did. They gave us money (in cash + IOU tokens) and we budgeted (with cash) for every hire. NEVER thought tokens would make us rich.
It's the end of an era (and cheap mini pitchers): @mina_bloom_ reports on the closure of iconic Logan Square dive The Mutiny https://t.co/mFHqIVGz4b

@MauricioPena @BlockClubCHI @slulay2 @stoomey It's not hard to edit a reporter who asks the right questions, works tirelessly to get answers, has great news judgment and is genuinely one of the best humans I've ever met. Thanks for being you, Mo. &lt;3 &lt;3

When I describe what @BlockClubCHI is about, Alisa is always the example I use. She's someone who truly gets what the neighborhood cares about (because she cares too). There will never be another like her, and to say she'll be missed is an understatement. https://t.co/Axs9Qx2Sdr

@nikkicamcam Oh, I agree. Just was responding to the folks saying "guns aren't the problem."
@ceva1194 Stop and frisk would not have stopped this guy, he had a legal concealed carry permit.
@nikkicamcam There are many issues that contribute to gun violence, but the accessibility of them in this country is so obviously a problem that it makes me want to scream when folks deny it.

Thanks to @NewsMatch, every dollar you donate through the end of 2018 will be matched, doubling your gift. It's a great opportunity to support truly local, independent and nonpartisan news.
Yes, having a very wealthy benefactor is helpful. But watching as real people throw in $20, $50 of their hard-earned money to support local journalism is so much better.
*thread* For those of us who worked at @DNAinfo, today is a sad anniversary. One year ago, we were shut down without warning. It was devastating. Starting up @BlockClubCHI has been the most difficult and rewarding experience of my life, and we could not have done it without you.

@BoozyBeggarChi @BrEpicBreen @BlockClubCHI Also, thank you.
@BoozyBeggarChi @BrEpicBreen @BlockClubCHI Nah, some nonprofit dedicated to ethics in media that didn't feel the need to get comment on a piece that completely attacked a startup, nonprofit newsroom.
@maricohen95 The same way music writers or food writers should have some knowledge of the industries or arts they criticize. This job, as you know, is not easy. Don't know what kind of org FAIR runs but pretty horrified they felt that piece was ... fair.
@maricohen95 As for the Mean Girls GIF, I tweet this about all media writers, all the time. I personally am offended by people who spend their time tearing others down instead of doing any of this work themselves. Also believe that media critics should have SOME reporting experience.
@maricohen95 Some of the criticisms were that we did not have a second source in a DUI patrol warnings. These were requested by readers so folks knew when there would be an increased police presence in their neighborhoods. Lumping those in with their "analysis" was incredibly misleading.
@maricohen95 Hi Mari! I published our stance on crime reporting here. The piece that ran on FAIR was misleading and I did not want to rush to comment on Twitter (while drowning in copy) because the writer didn't give me a chance to respond in advance: https://t.co/OIheuF6bVJ
. @BlockClubCHI's reporters work their asses off every day to cover the neighborhoods they live in and love, and nothing wipes away a day of shitty @ replies like plotting more impactful stories and editing more scoops.
Some folks have asked about @BlockClubCHI's crime reporting strategy in the last 24 hours. We were not given the chance to comment in the misleading piece published about us, so here's where we stand: https://t.co/OIheuF6bVJ
@mizamudio Congrats, queen! 💯👑
. @evanFmoore on how fearmongering surrounding the Van Dyke verdict has lasting implications for young athletes who are being taught to fear the city of Chicago https://t.co/71aPVFHr0M
@alsjakobso Seriously where do we buy one?
@maricohen95 I would have loved to comment for this story but not a single person from Block Club was asked to weigh in. Totally unethical for a site that allegedly cares about ethics in journalism. Also, multiple inaccuracies throughout.
@imLeor 🥰
@influxed @jheath @BlockClubCHI @stoomey @slulay2 The contributor has a personal beef with us. Has for awhile. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@jheath @BlockClubCHI @stoomey @slulay2 Also some fact checks: we didn't launch 8 months ago and we've done multiple stories on Universal Basic Income (that mention wage theft). But feel free to pitch us these stories in the future. Or just count our crime stories. Also, FYI: https://t.co/zYsRRcQBhG
@jheath @BlockClubCHI @stoomey @slulay2 I won't do his job for him. If he wants a comment, he can request one. Or use tweets while criticizing us for sourcing. LOL.
@jheath @BlockClubCHI @stoomey @slulay2 Would be cool if the "reporter" actually reached out for a comment BEFORE publishing this hit piece. It also fails to mention every single newspaper and TV station in Chicago publishes dozens more similarly-sourced pieces PER DAY than BCC.

Love NYT but this is RATCHET. Local newsrooms do more with less every day &amp; don't have the luxury of being the most well-known national newspaper in the world.

I could choose to drown in the sorrow of this country and this city and how totally fucked everything feels AND IS right now. But so many humans, specifically in Chicago, give me so much hope. And I’m so grateful.
Today was trash. But then @Waldens_Block dropped off these amazing @TheTRiiBE shirts. And @LinzeRice reminded me of Tuesday night @GirlTalkChi w/ @BriMostiller @PPIAction + @kammadb.

Don't doubt yourself. You don't serve these people. You serve the public. Also, ALWAYS blame your editor. And if you work for @BlockClubCHI, have the asshole give me a call.
It took me too long to realize that the people who try to shut down your story and make you feel foolish for pursuing it are assholes. Their jargon and bullshit non-answers and eye-rolling and condescension should be a sign to young reporters: you're on to something.
He's no longer there, thankfully. And other people in the office treated me just fine. But that doubt lingered. Am I not smart enough? Am I too inexperienced to get a story right? Am I asking stupid questions?
Several times in recent days, I've found myself talking to female journalists who've been treated like garbage by "official" sources. When I was starting out, I remember one cop at News Affairs who berated me every time I called. He made me feel stupid and small and clueless.

@TribuneKevin @imLeor Agreed. We were getting so many tweets and emails, we felt that we had to do SOMETHING. It is highly unusual for there to be no full lineup or sked at this point, + the LouFest thing had people freaked. Transparency is always a good idea IMO. Silence = GOSSIP.

@JamesCappleman @thedailylinechi @HeatherCherone How would a list of pre-approved murals prohibit people from flagging graffiti? Also, if a large scale mural is being painted on someone’s private property, wouldn’t they notice that right away / before all that time and money is poured into the work?
Also on the traffic side: unless you're a HUGE outlet (I think @deadspin send us a shit-ton of traffic a few times), or linking without rewriting large chunks of the story, people don't click through.
As we move into a space where traffic and banner ads matter less and reader loyalty is more valuable, aggregators should ask themselves how they actually can help the news outlets they're relying on every day. Your company SHOULD have a budget to pay for subscriptions, TBH.
Been on both sides, and was told when I was an aggregator I was "helping" newsrooms by rewriting their stories. This is not true. Yes, you are helping spread the word about a story which can and does have impact and that is good. But your non-reporting is not feeding reporters.
While I'm early morning ranting, I just want to clarify a misconception: when you link to another news outlet while aggregating their story, it does not send them traffic or make them money.
Listening to @CarlosMonjeJr defend Twitter on @NPR and may or may not be shouting at my radio. This is what happened to my friend last week. She quit Twitter and honestly who could blame her? This is only a portion of the horrific harassment she experienced and @twitter ignored. https://t.co/OJqwFOI3y0

PITCH ME: jen@blockclubchi.org Send me one or two links to previous work and your connection to the neighborhood you're interested in. News reporting preferred, don't send me opinion pieces, plz.
ALSO: If you're a reliable freelancer with clean copy and good ideas, chances are it will turn into a full-time neighborhood reporter position.
Why you should write for us: your stories WILL get read (our traffic is already pretty damn great!) and you'll get paid within 7 days. Yes, you read that correctly. We want stories of neighborhood characters, schools, development, new businesses, innovative community organizing!
Pullman, Austin, Garfield Park, North Lawndale, Hyde Park, Garfield Ridge, Jefferson Park, Bronzeville!

Selfie. https://t.co/Vgw4jqDhZ7
@imLeor Anyway, the hate feeds my soul so keep the nitpicking coming, please. It's super useful.
@imLeor Why would there need to be an independent critic to say whether a reporter was on scene of something or cited sources? That sounds like something we as news orgs should be spending money on instead of paying reporters.
@imLeor And I fail to see how letting readers know more about the reporting process is problematic. No one is taught media literacy and CLEARLY this country has a serious problem when it comes to telling fact from fiction. But why do I even give a shit at this point, really?
@imLeor Literally 90% of our stories over the past 5 years have been rewritten by TV stations here with no credit. Full copy/paste. You might be smelling a whiff of "fuck aggregators."
You're never too young to be a #CMJ. @TinaSfon and @slulay2 know what I mean. 🤪
@ourmaninchicago @pete_grieve @louisekiernan Thanks, Scott. Kind of horrified that anyone (let alone a journalism student) considers quickly reposting a Facebook video without context or verification journalism.

@JournoGeoffZ @popula @SophieHaigney @city_bureau @JournoDesign Don't be! I think it's a super tough topic &amp; have been really conflicted about it personally. Feedback we got at the Public Newsroom was that people DID want more follow ups. Limiting what we do cover in the first place would allow for more of that.
@JournoGeoffZ @popula @SophieHaigney @city_bureau @JournoDesign That would be great - but who has the budget for that? And who decides what is serious?
This @popula piece by @SophieHaigney gets into much of what we discussed at the Public Newsroom with @city_bureau and @JournoDesign about crime reporting: "My essential thinking is that newspapers should cover fewer crimes, and cover them well" https://t.co/oyHg6JFjUH

@loosechange1058 @youraveragejo @BlockClubCHI Hilariously, I've received other tweets saying our story and tweets are pro-police. Our story clearly outlines both sides of the story. We aren't activists and it's not our job to confirm anyone's opinion -- pro or against anything. The story is fully cited and reported.
@youraveragejo @BlockClubCHI @loosechange1058 Tweets aren't meant to tell an entire story. You cannot, in any way, tell a story this complicated in 120 characters.
@youraveragejo @BlockClubCHI @loosechange1058 True, but this tweet is clearly for people who have followed the story. Otherwise it wouldn't make sense. I guess I don't see how pointing out a relevant detail that was ignored in other stories is problematic.
Just because a news story does not confirm YOUR opinion does not mean it is inaccurate or "clickbait." Do people know what clickbait means anymore? Also, it's my fave when people who never bother doing reporting of their own claim to be experts. Monday: 🤬 BTW, THIS is clickbait: https://t.co/1yNYTwMo3S

Also: there are no industry standards when it comes to aggregation. We had some in the @HuffPost Chicago office, but the practice has gotten completely out of control and should be majorly reined in.
Honestly feel bad for this reporter. SO MANY news outlets over-aggregate and outright ignore the original authors when they're called out. One solution? Spend less time aggregating and more time REPORTING. https://t.co/7dRNNzDJj9

@Brother3j This week, @cbschicago. But every local station has been guilty of this.
Raise your hand if you've ever had a TV news person read a story YOU reported as if it were their own with ZERO credit. https://t.co/AGl2D82z9N
@1unionteacher I was JUST talking about the lack of knowledge surrounding these classes! Are you in my computer? We're looking into it.
@rlissau It's such a BASIC courtesy. Anyone who works at these places and has ever reported a story should know better. Let's start a shame train. 🥰
@NeilSteinberg AMEN. But this is where the majority of Chicagoans still get their news. It's baffling to me! They need to start paying us. 💅💅💅
@jcassano YES PLEASE. You brilliant angel.
@catherinebehan Ugh! One time we called them and were like, "wait so you got this IDENTICAL quote?" and they were like "uhhh..." and only THEN would they give credit. It's time to call them out - esp since they would have NO NEWS without print/digital reporters putting in the work.
@kena1019 Sending you a ton of love, Kena. I'm so sorry about your cousin and hope he makes a full recovery. He's lucky to have someone like you marching and praying for him and the rest of this city is as well. &lt;3
And if you do use our content, give some credit. It is truly the VERY LEAST you could do.

Didn't think I'd have to bang this drum again after how everyone mourned @DNAinfoCHI, but if you see a story on our now-fledgling website, PLEASE give us some credit. We did the work, and could use the name recognition if nothing else. (But you should link) https://t.co/uNEgxFbxV2

“It’s a free country. You can file a police report about anything. I could file a police report about you badgering me today by calling me 10 times." 🤣🤣🤣 Bless you, @fspielman https://t.co/a9467sQ8aH
@pudo @ProPublica (in every conversation I've had with everyone at Civil and every skeptical journalist involved in this, getting rich on tokens has NEVER been a goal. It's about making the platform accessible to folks beyond Silicon Valley bros.)
@pudo @ProPublica Each newsroom on Civil has its own business plan. There is no magical fairy dust to save the industry, you have to do good work and get readers to pay for it. Civil believes there's more to blockchain than bitcoin and is using journalism to prove that -- not get to rich.
@pudo @ProPublica Very true and I'm talking about local newsrooms specifically. We are also depending on foundations, just seems like a harder sell for local newsrooms: https://t.co/iIghFfew7s
Bitcoin tech bros have given blockchain a bad rep. But there are MANY amazing future uses that could empower YOU to own your own data (and maybe not have it sold off to the highest bidder by Facebook and Google) Best explainer EVER here: https://t.co/jloqbBqcxb
@celrae @nikkiusher @JenniferBrandel @RobertChannick @lynnsweet @richgor @solshe @cherylwt @Illinois_Alma 👋🥰
Also, I highly recommend listening to this if you want to hear about the people who are NOT terrible tech bros investing in blockchain technology. Also, a song to help you wrap your head around the whole thing! https://t.co/jloqbBqcxb
Cool subtweet but just because you can't or don't try to understand something doesn't mean it's bullshit. The real, measurable investment @Join_Civil has made in journalism is unmatched by any other startup or foundation or tech company I've seen. https://t.co/H1e5zhqyNM

Welcome to the @Join_Civil team @ColoradoSun! “I’d like to think that, if your local news organization is struggling, or if you believe that independent journalism is important, but you don’t yet really know what to do about, I’d like you to see how Civil can be home for ideas." https://t.co/uGvzllwiqo

@pang @BlockClubCHI 🥰  Thank you so much, Kevin! Means a ton for real. 💌
When you're listening to a podcast and shouting "HOLY SHIT THIS IS MY LIFE!" in the car to yourself. If you haven't listened to @zigzagpod by @manoushz and @jpoyant -- get on it. Especially if you've ever asked me about @Join_Civil or blockchain. 😂 🙌 https://t.co/ldzhvy7N6L
Love this story. Featuring a throwback @pang headline: “When the Polish lady says soup, you say yes." https://t.co/774k8sXn4C
@d_holli 🥳See, if I had known this I would have left my bed for Big Star last night. 🍾 Congrats, Darryl! This is fucking amazing and ILY.
@lenifaye @kane_one_ DEF cry-worthy. Congrats! Y'all earned this. 👑👑👑
@bechang8 SO stoked for you guys. Seriously doing the lord's work. Love you and am so inspired by this! 🥰🥰🥰
I am WAY too excited about this: Penelope's opening "twin" boutique that will offer housewares and stationary in addition to clothes cc @Streblowpop 😍  https://t.co/hUADiw59IU
@mpventura YOU are amazing and ILY.
@marthabayne Thank you, Martha!
Ok, I know I've been threadin' like a crazy woman lately so I'll wrap it up. Chicago media: your support has been SO RAD. Chicago deserves a collaborative news media that works for THEM. Inspired by this spirit and hope it continues. https://t.co/kcLIvBGJI3
And @formyblockchi gets his own tweet. Your support from Day 1 inspired every one of us to (attempt) to work as hard as you do for this city. You're the real deal and we are honored to have you as a collaborator and friend. You all deserve a pic of Jahmal today so here ya go. 😍 https://t.co/k7XtSDVGb7
Also: a MASSIVE thank you to our Founding Members, who kicked in enough cash to fund DOZENS of stories across the city. Does it get any cooler than @patthemanager and my idol Janice Feinberg of the Bessie and Joseph Feinberg Foundation? Nope. It really doesn't. https://t.co/AkVYwe6XbP
You have no idea how much this means to us. We have cried MANY JOYOUS TEARS because of your support and belief in us. https://t.co/dobUN1f6OI
Then we were like, "Holy shit! Hiring reporters and covering the news is expensive AF" and Chicago was like https://t.co/LrbaX1xZIZ
When we decided to do this, another obstacle seemed to pop up every day: we need a designer! A place to work! A way to reward backers! Our friends came to the rescue: @ssears333 @Paul_Biasco @quiotechicago @PinkHouse_Media @CoGenCoworking @hideoutchicago https://t.co/4meLkdklRW
Also, the other AMAZE #firstfleet journos! Including my personal hero @mariabustillos, @ppolitics, @mazsidahmed, @NushinRashidian, @J__Velasquez, @alysonrmartin, @alexkotch @jcassano 😍😍😍😍 READ THEIR AMAZING STORIES: https://t.co/MfltI9h2wu https://t.co/vXLWvqyJwv
The BEYOND generous, kind, brilliant team at @Join_Civil. Typically when it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. That was NOT the case with you. @nicolebode is AGAIN my mentor (and friend). @matthewiles' enthusiasm has been contagious from Day 1. TOBY AND DAN ILYSM. https://t.co/k8bDWMKFtb

@myalogy @JimDeRogatis Definitely wasn't equating a journalist's role in this to the pain of victims. I was saying as a journalist who wanted this reporting to take down R. Kelly 20 years ago, it has to be infuriating to watch folks who can no longer claim ignorance shrug it off.
THE JOSH MCGHEE SHOW. So here for it. 👐 https://t.co/90vcdXl6Z8
@TheVoiceofJosh Holy shit! This rules! Congrats, Josh!

This RULES. So much magic in the @Join_Civil fam. https://t.co/4eRjqSwNks
@hedlynze 🙌💯
@evanFmoore Our server Stefan schooled me. 😍
I'm inspired by the block club captains we met last night. By the work @formyblockchi does to connect people from all over the city and specifically the message he had for the #OnTheTable2018 crowd: Democracy starts on a block level. To make an impact, you have to start at home.
A love for Rainbow Cone and thin-crust pizza (I learned about Italian Fiesta which is now on my list), a desire to know our neighbors better but an uncertainty about how to go about it.
It's so easy to get stuck in your comfort zone and not explore other parts of the city. But why live in a city like this and NOT branch out? We have so much in common. Including but not limited to: a disdain for how Chicago is portrayed in the national media.
Some thoughts/feelings from last night's #OnTheTable2018 event with @formyblockchi and @ChiBungalow: Everyone should go eat chicken and waffles at Capt. Hard Times, Jahmal Cole can run circles around every other community organizer I have ever met (sorry but it's true)

@tonikagj this is SO RAD.
THIS. https://t.co/L2VOnGBLpR
Negative coverage of Black Chicago led @TheTRiiBE to say: “How can [we] repair the relationship b/w media &amp; the community?” @MorganEliseJ
You have to offer something exclusive if you want people to pay for it. If it’s news you can get elsewhere, you’re screwed. @CityClubChicago
Weighing in on millennials paying for news: the majority of @BlockClubCHI subscribers pre-launch are 24-35. It’s $5 a month, which helps.

Also glad other Chicago media made sure to stay on this case (and live tweeted so I could frantically refresh all afternoon) @ChuckGoudieABC7 @BarbMarkoffABC7 @crepeau @agrimm34
Just want to reiterate what @slulay2 said earlier: @ericademarest's early reporting on the Marc Winner case led to more victims speaking out. Today, they saw their abuser convicted. Sad @DNAinfoCHI couldn't cover the verdict, but glad we listened to these women when we did.
EXHALE. https://t.co/NfolLjqkYW
My blood pressure is v high right now. OOF. https://t.co/k5gFJNCnJn

Horrified by the backlash surrounding this story. There are so many movies, books, TV specials about serial killers or white men/women who "snap." We try to understand the WHY, look into their history. When the perp is a POC, why is looking for answers so problematic for people? https://t.co/1TosOMuAap
There is another Jen Sabella and she runs an Italian restaurant that specializes in ravioli and I feel like I might be into that timeline.

@ajlatrace @robertloerzel He is a master manipulator, that is for sure. I feel for the young women who worked for his campaign.
@ellembee Complaining is ALWAYS fair game in my book. 🤷🏻‍♀️
@robertloerzel @ajlatrace Which name? The one he’s using now or one of his many aliases? Such a creep. Hopefully he leaves Chicago. 🚮
THIS is impact. Thank you, @jasongrotto. 👏 https://t.co/PXSrd6rGqr

"Ferro would regularly make sexual comments about women’s clothing and appearances, the former employees say, telling female staffers they looked 'hot' or that he liked it when they wore short skirts"
@marthabayne I am red faced and SEETHING over here.
"..the former editor of Grid says Ferro instructed him to stop assigning the satire column in the back of the magazine to female writers because Ferro didn’t think women were funny."
"Ferro talked about topics ranging from strippers and prostitutes to his beliefs that women in technology have to get ahead by using their looks and sexuality. ... She says he asked that she send him her resume, and told her that she should always include her photo."
"Kappler says Ferro told her that she didn’t need to sleep with people, but she did need to flirt and 'suck dick.'" https://t.co/9SIQl3JYVX
YESSSSS. I feel so seen. https://t.co/qxhSrGF2bP

It is possible to shine your light without dragging others down, to promote your work and mission without shitting all over someone else's. It actually FEELS GOOD to respect the work of others and acknowledge that your way is not the only way. Community &gt; ego. Otherwise... https://t.co/BjfK6SOVDH

@DanielKayHertz @Amanda_Kass @byalisonbowen @ourmaninchicago @Public_Ade NYC bagels are superior for sure. NOT PIZZA THO. Or hot dogs. 🙅‍♀️
@DanielKayHertz @Amanda_Kass @byalisonbowen @ourmaninchicago @Public_Ade this is an A+ tweet 🙌💯
@Amanda_Kass @Public_Ade @ourmaninchicago Also I’m calling dibs on “The Deep Dish Fallacy” book title.
@Amanda_Kass @Public_Ade @ourmaninchicago seriously few things get me as worked up as the deep dish fallacy. TAVERN CUT 4 EVER!

@pang @kbernot I'm only coming if there is actual ham.
@pang I think I defined this to my wife the other day as "like, you know, to go cray." Close-ish?
@arielfab Totally. It's a newspaper's job to inform people of this stuff for sure, but it can be done in a way that is accessible and honest without the paper itself taking a stand. Give me bullet points &amp; URLs to coverage (with well-written headlines so I know what I want to click on)
Raise your hand if you think newspapers should get out of the endorsement game. 🙋‍♀️ Especially when "they're good enough I guess" is basically their argument for a candidate. 🤮 h/t @arielfab https://t.co/ZYkhkCFdV3 https://t.co/Vjl185zBI1

@hfrishberg @slulay2 @WNYC This made me realize how much I use these archives. 😭 💔
I think @formyblockchi should get a @CNNHeroes honor because his ability to unite Chicagoans is unparalleled. Who else could get hundreds of people to show up to shovel snow on a frigid weekend? He makes me want to be a better person every day https://t.co/JcSBTpSmJz https://t.co/6tXv2qdtz7

@bechang8 Thank you, Bettina! &lt;3
So, thank you. Thank you for believing in local journalism and real boots on the ground, place-based reporting. We want @BlockClubCHI to be a news source you can rely on and trust, and will work our tails off to make sure that it is.
The support for @BlockClubCHI has honestly blown my mind. We knew Chicago wanted its neighborhood news back, but the fact that we are so close to being the most funded LOCAL journalism Kickstarter in U.S. history is just... wow https://t.co/kM0O2Elx7Z
For years I felt like I was doing the wrong thing as a journalist by staying in Chicago, the city I grew up in. The city I love more than anything. But the past few months have made me love this place more than ever.
Got a little sappy in my update to @Kickstarter backers this morning (https://t.co/feUEtSEnQx), so I'll continue that here. 🤷‍♀️When @DNAinfoCHI closed, my heart broke. But just 4 months later, I'm more hopeful about the future of local news than ever. https://t.co/d24MrgibwK

PHEW. You all are amazing. I am beyond #blessed to work with such passionate people who REALLY CARE about this city and its neighborhoods. Thank you, Chicago. &lt;3 We got you. https://t.co/jUZ1ODo283 https://t.co/mFBhi1abrM
He covered how missing black residents in Cook County often don't get added to databases due to racism among law enforcement https://t.co/EtndzqsVZO and broke down why residents near the Obama Library so badly want a CBA https://t.co/EtndzqsVZO https://t.co/mFm1nv8Bml
And the amazing @Mario_Demiuex, who comes to us from the @ChiDefender, the @CrusaderNewspap and @city_bureau. His passion for telling neighborhood stories also shined at @AustinWeeklyChi https://t.co/2vFgiwRO0l
And broke the story of the proposed merger of Ogden International School and Jenner Elementary, which drew national attention and was finally approved by the school board this week  https://t.co/SHHJ2P9gCR https://t.co/Qt2Y6CPQMo
And the incredible @mina_bloom_, who covered various 'hoods for @DNAinfoCHI before landing on Logan Square and Humboldt Park, where she called out how an alderman profited from soaring property values before changing the rules for other residents https://t.co/KVRjkdB4xM https://t.co/0YbjINlbHE
Her reporting on 5-year-old cancer patient Lucas Bear led to an international campaign to write the dying Belmont Cragin boy birthday cards, brightening his final days https://t.co/QF0UQfrPql https://t.co/tHpObCspRf
And @BauerJournalism, where do I even begin? She started as a @DNAinfoCHI intern and rapidly became one of our most prolific breaking news reporters, quickly + accurately letting students and parents know that CPS might close their school https://t.co/UkJWdqsxiw https://t.co/J7ugRMiooZ
Including the death of 7-year-old Amari Brown: https://t.co/Q3yIrTMAcf. He went on to tell the stories of the horrific working conditions for immigrant farm workers in southern California at the @DesertSunNews https://t.co/MW1z1PV2YH
And @MauricioPena, whose enthusiasm and passion for covering Chicago and its neighborhoods is contagious. He started as a breaking news reporter at @DNAinfoCHI, bringing compassion to some really difficult stories. https://t.co/6I5rAoZNCv
She covered the Bloomingdale Trail/606 from start to finish, wrote about the plight of disabled residents in the neighborhood, covered cyclists and their quest for better street protections, highlighted HUNDREDS of local businesses and people https://t.co/NFJI2yeVT4
OK Y'ALL. Here's the deal. There are FIVE DAYS LEFT to donate to @BlockClubCHI's @kickstarter (https://t.co/jUZ1ODo283) and I want to brag about the reporters we are employing full time. Let's start with @DNA_WPB: She's been tirelessly covering Wicker Park for 12 YEARS https://t.co/ImTTTPTGFp

5/5 We met @Mario_Demiuex and were like: "YES," in unison. I challenge you to find someone else who can come up with about 100 neighborhood story ideas off the top of their head that are all BRILLIANT https://t.co/jUZ1ODo283 https://t.co/uXonCX0oPF
4/5 And @mina_bloom_, who didn't even hesitate for a single second when we came to her with this crazy idea. LET'S DO THIS THING. What a GD queen https://t.co/jUZ1ODo283 https://t.co/8bdMOKmk6o
3/5 Let's also talk about @BauerJournalism, who managed to shoot and edit our Kickstarter video on the tightest timeline ever and can write a story at superhuman speed https://t.co/jUZ1ODo283 https://t.co/QEaz3oFT6f
2/5 And @MauricioPena, who was a breaking news badass at DNA before doing incredible work on immigration and equality at the Desert Sun and working with legend @bechang8 at Chi mag https://t.co/jUZ1ODo283 https://t.co/1MLXY3YL9j
1/5 THREAD: Let's talk about the incredible reporters joining us on this adventure. There's @DNA_WPB, the original DNAhole who is a legend on her beat https://t.co/jUZ1ODo283 https://t.co/R6Ba0IR1FR

@PSkosey @TinaSfon Also, I am never at a loss for words. 💅
@PSkosey @TinaSfon Maybe someone should tell her about the significant spike in violence against trans people since her fave president took office. Or the fact that trans adults are 22 times more likely to attempt suicide than the general population.
@PSkosey @TinaSfon Pretty sure me tweeting about a desire that will never come to fruition is less offensive than dehumanizing people based on who they are and where they come from in a widely publicized ad campaign that will only fuel more hatred and bigotry. But yeah, still wanna punch her.
My mom just sent me a video of her asking my 1-year-old nephew where his nipple is, in case anyone was wondering why I am the way I am.
@TinaSfon My desire to punch this woman in the face is OVERWHELMING.
If I see Jeanne Ives in a "girls" bathroom, the earrings are coming out. It's sad when you're such a pathetic nobody that you have to release a hateful ass ad to get attention. https://t.co/ykRdOUPh6r

@ramsincanon But for some inane reason NO ONE'S answer to saving journalism seems to be HIRING SOME MORE LOCAL BEAT REPORTERS.
@ramsincanon I tend to agree. IDEALLY Google would fund trained journalists to report on their neighborhoods, giving residents a physical person to contact when a story needs to be told.
Love community engagement/hearing from readers and they should have a voice. Hate the theory that everyone just inherently has the skills to be a journalist with zero experience / training. https://t.co/Htg6lnNdjV

@Tati_WM Totally. And if you compare the coverage of other crimes to sexual crimes against women, it's extra baffling. Like, there is rarely hesitation about publishing the testimony of a robbery victim.
@Tati_WM I have been thinking about this a lot. How the burden of proof has shifted. Like, a woman's word was never enough in newsrooms until the NYT decided it was.

@ourmaninchicago Def think that's a HUGE missing part of the entire feral/rat convo. It's a big commitment &amp; you have to care about and for the kitties!
@ourmaninchicago Haha. I don't think anyone should take in a feral colony unless they properly take care of them/feed them/fix them.
@Pidgejen I def don't think anyone should get a feral unless they commit to taking care of 'em. PAWS makes it A LOT easier and has an amaze program.
@Pidgejen We built lil houses in our yard that are heated and feed them twice a day. The hunting is just fun for them. 😬  😬  😬  😬
@Pidgejen I don't think anyone should have them unless they take care of them. I'm a colony caretaker, so PAWS spayed them, gave 'em shots for free.

@WithLoveSRenee That's not to say that was the show's intent (I LOVE Lena and want to watch it) but the lack of communication with neighbors was an issue.
@WithLoveSRenee I think that's why the neighbors were so peeved. They just saw the fancy cam crews come in and felt like they were being exploited.
@WithLoveSRenee Which is the only reason most of us get into such a shitshow industry -- the impact is undeniable.
@WithLoveSRenee Journalists tell stories and by definition we aren't allowed to be activists. But by telling stories, it holds powers that be accountable.
@WithLoveSRenee Not really sure what you're getting at. We covered a story, like we do every day, and I tweeted it, like I do all the time.
@WithLoveSRenee We gave Showtime/The Chi a heads up about this multiple times, and they blew us (and the neighbors) off until TV stations started calling.
@WithLoveSRenee Being in the media is by definition putting things on blast. Which is why our reporters are contacted when neighbors feel wronged.
@WithLoveSRenee I'm a journalist and we cover neighborhoods. North Lawndale residents asked us to tell their story. That's exactly what we did.
@WithLoveSRenee Actually, I host a monthly social justice show with women from around Chicago, and all proceeds go directly back to the neighborhoods. Also
Jezebel followed up on @BauerJournalism's story w/ local churches &amp; food pantries, which said they would accepted any donations. https://t.co/cn1D3KegLP

Ok, I'm done. But the media shitting all over other media for doing reporting that needs to be done makes me want to punch things.
7. Unlike the TV AND print news orgs that took the scoop, re-reported it, gave zero credit to Johnston.
6. She gave more credit to the reporter who got the returns than I've EVER seen on TV. Repeated David Cay Johnston's name/site several times
5. She tweeted she had the returns. That's it. Considering the hype that other news orgs give their own scoops, it was pretty minimal.
4. People talking shit have CLEARLY never watched her show before. She ALWAYS provides context to the story, and goes deep. That's HER THING
3. Even if he DID leak the returns, reporting on them is OUR FUCKING JOB. Was she supposed to just sit on them?
2. This is television news. They promote their scoops in advance so people will watch. Also: the argument that this was a Trump trick is BS
(THREAD) Was going to let this go but NAH. The argument that Maddow was somehow tricking us by saying she had the tax returns is so dumb..
