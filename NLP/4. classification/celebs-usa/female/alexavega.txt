@itsmeleighton Bahaha. What?! That's hilarious!
@Whitneyanne95 😘
@Damariszks :) just waking up!
@Crazy_SoulXo then you are my princess ;)
@loggiesdimples ooooh. 👑 fancy! :)
@Whitneyanne95 basically what you speak will come to you.
@flyinwithjustin más o menos. :)
The power of the tongue is life and death— those who love to talk will eat what it produces.
@Whitneyanne95 because they are just hurting. My faith keeps me strong. :) and I just want to be loving.
@daniela83377223 thanks for the follow! :)
@Rusher12345678 I can ignore them or love them. :) I'm just going to love them.
@JonahKresovich I wish you all the best and the softening of your heart. God bless.
@LicketySchmidt Bahahaha. Hilarious!
@mayvaz0424 @JonahKresovich then why follow me if you hate me so much?
@mayvaz0424 yes... freedom of speech. But trying to be hurtful and mean is just evil. Why would anybody want to put that on someone?
@Aly615 hahah. Love this!
@clemelala613 they need the attention and love they aren't getting at home. Which is why we can't be hateful back. Just loving.
@JonahKresovich goodness you need some Jesus in your life. Seriously though. Love. Don't hate.
@Whitneyanne95 You shouldn't want to be anyone but the world changer that you are! We can all be world changers!
If your bully's timeline is filled with tweets about you... Then they are infatuated with you. Take it as a compliment. :)
I think bullies are either secretly in love with you or want to be you.
FYI don't blow your nose and pee at the same time. I don't know what I just did... But it hurt.
@Carlosfan9 Awww thank you :)
@Whitneyanne95 black hair looks awesome on you! Both work! I am always partial to blonde though :)

Faith is not blind. Faith always sees. Faith sees through the storm… Faith always sees the end result.
Everything produces after its kind.
