Omg what is happening right now!!! 🤠 🐎 #NED
@Eurovision 🇮🇱🔥👌🏼
So many bands and so many ballads this year! #eurovision #esc2018
@bbceurovision Okay #FIN - you can sing gurl
@lacasadebuse @WWESARO Lol.

Estonia 2018 entry..... WOW. Her voice. Those notes. WHAT!!
@lettersbylav “Raining in Paradise” is my favorite on that album as well.
@matilda_teodora @escheart I’m pretty nice. 😊. Just followed you.
@94artt @SerobKerob Sevak is a very talented dude. My comments (in recent days) refer to the joy I feel w/ the (much needed) regime change in our country. This change will trickle down... 🙏🏻 And now is the time for young Armenian talent to shine. ⭐️
@tamacoochie I am from Scottsdale and my brother just graduated from @ASU ❤️
https://t.co/Z71jvFgfoD
@PashinyanAm @BleuArm Congratulations! The future is bright for our amazing country.
@escheart Thank you for all the sweet messages ❤️.  Can’t wait to see who makes it into the top 10. My money is on Cyprus to win this! #allabord #eurovision
@larisahova @MaggieRyan14 I have dibs on Audrey for suuuuuurr gurlz. Thanks. Bye.
@BleuArm @julienbahloul @Eurovision I think a lot of incredible change is coming! The swamps of Armenia are being cleaned and it is an exciting time. I am going to try and meet with Nikol in June during @NvakFoundation.
@BleuArm @julienbahloul That is because the song is definitely NOT Eurovision. Sevak has a beautiful voice. 🔥 That’s a fact. But the song will not chart well bc it does not fit the format of the show. What Public TV still doesn’t understand: @Eurovision is a SONG COMPETITION.
@scandiIove @touynari ❤️u
@houseofstang A+
@scandiIove 😘
@GabrielSaporta Same! We’ve been missing out. Big. Time.
@atanessi @RaffiElliott Me no like.
Follow @NvakFoundation on twitter and Instagram. Applications are open for both Nvak Yerevan and Nvak Jerusalem. Link is in my bio! https://t.co/vvfWPYESN8
@AngelaSarafyan @AnthonyHopkins Yup. Love this. I wanna come over!
@atanessi You make a very good point. One step in the right direction re: Serzh resignation. But a lot more needs to change.
Proud of this young generation of Armenians who are not afraid to voice their grievances via peaceful protests. Government corruption MUST come to an end. I am with you. #velvetrevolution #ArmenianProtests #armenia #qaylara https://t.co/kNGQXyT5ti
ABBA greatest hits album playing in this Tribeca coffee shop. I’m feeling it. Super distracting.
@atanessi I agree. Same.
@SerobKerob I am on the side of the Armenian people. It breaks my heart to see so much chaos and violence. And again- this why I think programs like @NvakFoundation (clean organizations/ companies) are so necessary in a country full of corruption.
@SerobKerob @houseofstang @ForestHillsStdm @infatuation What is going on in the country currently is very upsetting. And the Armenian people deserve to have a voice. That said, I generally stay out of political conversations. Bc let’s be honest, we all know what happens when you speak out against corruption in Armenia.
@escheart @NvakFoundation Yaaaassss! Do it!!!!!
@NvakFoundation application form is up! AND we are scaling the program. Our next stop —&gt; Jerusalem! https://t.co/KyNwcQfyGG

@ermalmeta4life @UnitedSingdom @CurtisLee__ @bbceurovision @surieofficial @AnnieLennox @ArmPublicTV For sure! @NvakFoundation &amp; our amazing songwriters will always be involved w/ everything/anything moving forward. The best part about “Poison”- the song was co-written w/ 3 young female songwriters (the youngest being 14 yrs old). Nvak is becoming a female empowerment program.
@UnitedSingdom @CurtisLee__ @bbceurovision @surieofficial @AnnieLennox Well, since @ArmPublicTV don’t want me 😉 @bbceurovision: should I try my chances with you? I do love the U.K. A LOT.

@LMardanyan @lacasadebuse @ArmPublicTV It’s okay, Luc. ❤️I really really don’t want you to feel bad about this anymore. It is not worth it, and it is not worth beating yourself up over it. Everyone should (and does) understand that your intention was good.
BEYOND proud of my husband @houseofstang, and his partner @schmooey, in buying the legendary @Zagat (from @Google). Ya’ll got a🔥🔥🔥 media company now. Can’t wait to see what this new chapter brings for @infatuation. Love you both. https://t.co/2QZadwneTO

@Worldvisionews When you are playing a rigged game, and then, like that is not enough, you are surrounded by ppl who play the game w/ bad sportsmanship (THE ENTIRE TIME), after a while, that makes your head spin. Trust me.

@JeffTweetsESC Great question. Not sure what the answer is. I would think it is multiple rounds?
I really hope that’s not the case. I think @ArmPublicTV will give everyone a fair shot. And whoever is truly the best, and whoever’s song is the most reactive, that’s who will/ should go. https://t.co/48DYFBhrED
One of the reasons @nvakfoundation gives me so much joy is because I get to come across talent like @LMardanyan. Check out the song that she and Gagach wrote during Nvak 2017 Yerevan (@tumocenter). So proud of these girls ❤️excited for them to perform in Depi Evradesil. https://t.co/3MSQ91PoqM

Both songs are different, which is cool. Hers is disco/ throwback 70s. Fits her vibe &amp; her jazzy voice. Mine is an ethnic modern pop song with Armenian and English lyrics. It was important to me that since we are competing for 🇦🇲, that we include Armenian instruments + lyrics. https://t.co/W1OkbaHckD

Saw it the first time, darlin. Still incorrect. Since she uses "Arabella" in the sentence- that is the equivalent of "Bob." https://t.co/QOBLJOd3jT
@BabyILikeIt_xD @IvankaTrump lol- it is not "me." Sorry to break it to ya, buddy.
@beebecathy @IvankaTrump - word.
@ESCSamuel @Eurovision - so to answer the question. Who knows lol.
@ESCSamuel @Eurovision - dunno. While @jamala is an incredible performer. Never would have thought her song was strong enough to win.
@IvankaTrump: "Arabella and I"
@ESCSamuel - depends on a lot of things, right? Really on the other songs that are submitted for @Eurovision.

@ArmenKaprelian Not stupid enough to think it is directed towards me.
@ArmenKaprelian People are absolutely entitled to differing opinions. It's when those opinions are incessantly thrown in ppls faces that it's irritating.
@ArmenKaprelian @shoushana_k Ugh.
@ArmenKaprelian @shoushana_k That's fine. But even by writing the silly "if you use this phrase" post is equally immature and ignorant. Just stop talking about it.
@shoushana_k Ignorance = not okay.
