Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love when people try to sign but if we can't understand each other, just read the phone &amp; so that way we are on the same page in the conversation.
Whenever I go in public &amp; I tell them that I can't hear &amp; show my phone what I want to say. They would say, 'oh I know sign language' so I signed back 'awesome' &amp; then they didn't understand me &amp; still wouldn't look at my phone. Why??????
