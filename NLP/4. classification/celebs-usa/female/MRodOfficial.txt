Hilary you said you'd never quit, half of your supporters are freaking out because the majority of the popular vote was ignored by delagates
It's funny the so called rebel anti establishment trump won the election purely through his use of establishment mostly guys, in so over it
It's important to note that the American People chose Hilary Clinton the Establishment chose him &amp; that's why Trump is next president.
I'm hope the rest of the world does not judge Americans by their president because the people chose Hilary a group of delegates chose Trump
I hope Hilary Clinton is proud that the American People truly came out for her &amp; voted in her favor, delegates who do they speak for????????
The only reason he is getting away with this win is because The Democrats are civil people, if it was the other way around it'd be civil war

No one else admits that mass incarceration is a federal reform problem but her that's the only real way to stop the cop issues in the USA

hope they dont waste time talking bout gossip at the debates this campaign has turned into an episode of TMZ its humiliating I'm so over it
I think if Hilary can address what's wrong with the system instead of defending it &amp; explain how to fix it she can win the debate Sunday
Sheesh just saw that 2005 Trump video man what a sleaze bucket why am I not surprised, sounds more like him than his half hearted apology
Trump obviously has no respect for women but I will say this, that chick that just came forward seems like a goldigger that failed at it

@ReDevil666 isn't part of the whole evolutionary system to have the next generation push the envelope of life faster than those before ;)
@ReDevil666 some people carry this teenage attitude into their 30's like most wild skaters or the guys from Jack Ass, a cultural phenomenon
@ReDevil666 its like a teenagers courage the kind that only comes with the innocence of youth, like invisible courage to be a jack ass ;)
@ReDevil666 kinda like kids imitating adults, but I recall my teenage years being pretty insane, I blame that on my invisible balls

@pelada24 and white was funny for me to learn white is an all encompassing colour, white is the mixture of all colours into one, weird huh;)
@pelada24 Black is a beautiful colour its the absence of light. lite is absorbed by black &  like a vortex, light never escapes the colour
I'm thinking the answers Hell Yeah!!! ;)
Is it true. That your open to an all encompassing frequency you can illuminate full awareness at even darkest corners of existence?

@ProgMetalguitar I personally don't have kids but I love them and know they're the future so it hurts to see them seeming so lost
@ProgMetalguitar  actually good idea, may help in finding a proactive solution to help people to become aware and do something about it

@303Loco i worry about keeping up with the rest of the world in math & science or the kids won't have jobs let alone a cultural identity
@JustinMarroquin I might have to take a trip across the country to see what the kids think, this documentary had too many adult P.o.v's
@Mononoke__Hime and you'd think unions are supposed to make things easier
@AntonioReyX360 gotta say sad but true, this documentary really sheds light on what's wrong and all fingers point to adult bureaucracy sad
@LunyTheDon the name has tons of irony to it for sure, I'm tempted to try and do something myself, never been the type to wait for people ;)
