@brandicarlile Dude. You don’t even know. My jaw is still on the floor of the Staples Center. I bow to you.
So.   I am changed.   My jaw is on the floor. Holy shit.   #BrandiCarlile #GRAMMYs
That was extraordinary. I feel so grateful to have had a front row seat to witness a woman on her 75th birthday be better at everything than I will ever be. #DianaRoss #GRAMMYs
I told BTS that their fans are very passionate and when they saw I’d be sitting with them, they told me to look out for them. So if they need a snack or whatever, I’m on it. 👍🏻  #GRAMMYs
I was worried that my pain would turn out to be “nothing serious” or something that I should have been able to fight through. I’m so grateful to these women. Even if we only interacted for a moment, know that the attention and kindness you give your patients is so appreciated.🧡
…the young woman whose name started with “L”?? I can’t remember… in fairness, you were one of the people giving me the heavy shit right before I went under… but you laughed at my tired ass “If I die, clear my search history” joke and I appreciate that.
So, I need to give a shout out to the Atlanta doctors and nurses who helped me through my first experience with kidney stones when I was at my most vulnerable and terrified. Especially the truly wonderful ladies: Renee, Sandra, Muriel, Beverly, Ashley, Nina, Callie, and...
I love Maine. I love Mainers. 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Holy shit. I just remembered I was in Twilight.

@alohauregui Sometime this week. Back to black.
@jillemader Still early, when I was learning that the "neon" sharpies just looked like highlighter. Didn't do many in that color either.
@MariamJ_A Actually I can tell that's the gray sharpie. It looked like worn out black so I didn't do many in that color. So... it's rare?
@TomQWood for whatever reason, the darker colors were easier to sign with so I started gettin real free with it. Leading to giant signatures
@Jobadich1 more than I thought I'd realistically sell.
Still early, but a few days in. Moved on to colored pens, but still signing on the small side. https://t.co/OeG9KL2mwH

@KFoleyFL I couldn't agree more. Real Men should be outraged that Trump would imply this is normal/typical male behavior.
"Locker room banter" implies "C'mon, this is how men talk about women." Like it's to be expected. That's the grossest part of all.

Halfway through dress rehearsal for SNL tonight. Lots of quick costume changes. So far only two truly painful wedgies. I'll keep you posted.
Backstage at SNL feels more like the set of "30 Rock" than SNL. I might shout for Dr Spaceman and see what happens. #DiabetesRepairIGuess
@parkerehret How batshit is that??? How has a random picture u took on the street one morning become my default headshot??? It's EVERYWHERE
If I die unexpectedly can everyone just do the right thing and pretend I was a way better person than I am?
Was reeeeally hoping @louisck was gonna do me a solid and phone it in on SNL last night. Talented piece of shit.
When I'm home alone I eat tri-color pasta one color at a time.... and it feels great.
@stinkinpaws Awww. Too sweet! And so unexpected!
Oh, Sean Bean. Even in National Treasure I'd still hit that.

I suspect the only time Brits actually do the kiss-on-each-cheek thing is with visiting Americans bc they know it will make us feel cultured
@Alex_Mellion I totally agree.
@thehumphreyker @ellabellasmith I don't know what happening......
@robdelaney I'm his Guru.
@zakkrooney I didn't have my phone! I was riding a horse and trying to experience the moment! #RookieMistake
I just saw a horse rolling around in a field like a damn puppy. I am convinced I will never see anything better as long as I live.

@MaraWritesStuff He didn't! (The swine) Bless you though! (The crazy bitch inside me head is momentarily appeased)
@MaraWritesStuff Oh yeah, this chick in my head is a psycho. So needy.
@MaraWritesStuff I doubt it. I'm with her all the time, so a fucking break would be nice.
So "Kendrick" is trending worldwide. I can only assume this is because of my ongoing feud with @zachbraff #ThisRapGame #GreatestAlive
@ColleenB123 @georgiastitt @MirandaSings I try to learn from her everyday!
@toddlouiso Yes! God, I've been petitioning them long enough!
@georgiastitt @ColleenB123 Wow, Colleen puts in a good effort, but it's hard to shine in the company of brilliance. That Miranda is a star.
@ellabellasmith No one likes a show off Ella. That's why I don't travel with my roller-skates.

@kknightdotcom emotionally, yes. (which is also super hot right?)
@liljonarrr Dave tries to boost my self-esteem.... this dude succeeds. Stay creepy my friend.
I'm on Letterman tonight. Dave tries to boost my self-esteem. Then makes me sing. So... that's available for your viewing pleasure. #FYI
So, is making the in-flight announcement the only good part of a pilot's day? Because good LORD do they milk that shit.
@ElizabethBanks @jaymonyc @RebelWilson @maxhandelman Yeah, Jason and I are pretty street. Sorry if we made you squares uncomfortable.
Holy balls my tweet is on the front page of r/funny? Dying happy now.
Holy box office Batman!!! NONE of us thought we were making a #1 movie when we signed on. So proud. #EndOfWatch
@PaulGriffin so true
Every time I talk to a fancy journalist and they ask what I do in my free time my scumbag brain goes "say masturbate, it'll be hilarious"
@nerdist you've seen Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, yes? (Shut up, it counts as Sci-fi)
Dear @joe_swanberg you are my hero. http://t.co/0nRy8XfL
Jeff VanVonderen is really the Christina Hendricks of "Intervention." You always get excited when you find out it's a Jeff episode.
Sure, it's from my mom but this made my day. Thanks Mom, I'm VERY proud. Love you! http://t.co/N1L5pl2t
I love when stores have petite sections; the clothes fit, and all the shoppers are tiny which makes me feel normal for a while #DreamBig
@peteholmez Speaking on behalf of Annas everywhere, we secretly love it. Go nuts.
@rcjohnso Hahahaha. I'm imagining you screaming that into a old timey mic in the center of a boxing ring.
@rcjohnso Okay, it's a plan. I'll go see Looper, you see Pitch Perfect (so we can die happy, obviously) and then we fight to the death!
@rcjohnso There is NOTHING friendly about Connect Four. I will school you.
I'm on CONAN tonight. I use a bunch of dirty words. Don't miss it. (11pm)
.@nerdist "smart human!" I love this descriptor.
@BauervanStraten Um, it DOES make sense. I have a policy against standing next to gorgeous, statuesque blondes in photos.
@DocZeke71 Oh yeah I used to love "The Jim Show." They really jumped the shark in season 5 though.
@bwfcdom83 whenEVER possible. (I'm typing this with one hand)
@DanWilkinson keep 'em guessing...
@xfloormattx okay, THAT was a stretch. But I respect it.
@Smilerbull haha!
@xfloormattx Watch out, we're dealing with a badass over here.
When you first saw The Truman Show, did anyone else walk around for the next week not picking your nose JUST in case?
@AnaGasteyer you're wonderful.
Thanks to @nerdist for inviting me to play, @BenFolds 5 for the tune, and @robcorddry for his dulcet tones on the Fraggle Rock theme.
FRAGGLES! BEN FOLDS FIVE! And I got to play too! (watch to the end x) #LifeHighlight #Sqee http://t.co/TYxEAOGq
@BenLewisHere too true. PS I miss your face.
@greg11c why AREN'T you watching a kids movie? Missing out...
And Ricci and Chlumsky are totally hot for each other right? I'm not saying it's bad, I just need to acknowledge that's what's happening.
Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain is on &amp; I have had a LOT of cough syrup. Am I high or was this movie this trippy when I was a kid?
My roommate when I walked into the living room: "Just some Real Housewives and bean dip. It's gonna be a good Saturday bro." Love you bro.
@Der_T_ Nick Nolte. But in a hot way.
Oh god someone please rip out my throat and make the pain stop. This is not worth the temporary phone sex voice. #TyphoidMary
@pedodare Huh. Someone with a pedobear icon is suggesting me for mother/daughter combos. So, today is a weird day.
My favorite thing about Twitter is reading the reactions of the 60% of people who can't tell I'm kidding.
Can't tear myself away from watching this @KenMarino and @nickkroll thing unfold. #BestUseOfTwitterEver #LateForWork
Sleepwalk With Me is lovely, uncynical filmmaking. I laughed, I cried - first movie in a long time I actually wished was longer. See it!!
Martin McDonagh, you restore my faith in humanity every damn time, you sick, magnificent bastard. #SevenPsychopaths
@steveagee Don't patronize me.
@anniesboobs_  except you. You get me, Annie's boobs.
Nobody gets me.
I hate it when you can tell a comedian has done something just to put it in his act. Like going on a blind date, or having kids.
@spinlighter damn copyright laws!
@CKnoblockhead The injustice!
@jecics89 HA!
I can't believe they cut the scene where I walk away from that explosion in slow motion without flinching! Dammit!!
I think I'm honestly in like 5 minutes of The Company You Keep but I'm ALL over that trailer. Should I pretend I got cut out &amp; I'm FURIOUS?
@mermon7 Ha! This photo....... is interesting
End of Watch screening was breathtaking; audience response was INTENSE. Congrats to Jake, Michael, David Ayer. I'm proud to be part of it.
@WatchHambo yeah, I'm thinking of starting a charity for us

I probably got to see more films on the plane ride here than I will be able to at the festival itself. Oh the irony. #firstworldproblems
@hitRECordJoe awww :)  AND you're lookin' fly on the cover of the mag in my hotel room here. I can't get rid of you! x
Why do airlines always seem to panic when the flight is full? Isn't that your goal? Why are you so unprepared for your goal??
@Riles1979 True that. (That's actually what I assumed was happening at first)
@DrewAtHitFix OH! Solid burn! ... followed by a compliment...  I'm disappointed in you. #GoForTheJugular
Dudes I waited til I was home to tweet. I don't tweet and drive. I'll have you know I'm always too busy singing along to embarrassing music.

@frenzelfred Good call.
@littletinagogo haha yes, it was epic.
After my third anxiety dream in a row I've decided to cut my losses. So.... what is there to do in LA before 5:30? (it's very dark here)
@birbigs Truer words were never spoken. "She's the cheese and I'm the macaroni."
(Or sit around eating cookie dough straight from the package - I'm not here to judge)
It's at the National Theater in London. See it if you can! (read it if you can't!) Congratulations to everyone involved!
Got to see the stage adaptation of the wonderful book The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime. Imaginative, emotional, gorgeous.
@steveagee yeah "Etc" is a pretty obscure one, but you know, I'm quite the anglophile

@AllTrueThoughts Um... yeah. Yeah, I guess it would.
I prefer cell phone games that you play vertically, that way people think I'm texting/emailing/being very busy and important.
@StAr_LiGht_1605 haha yes!!!! was wondering if anyone would pick up on that.  And had Pavlova an hour ago #Weird
@sophiefielding_ True! And named for a Russian, but you can't find it in the states and I had it tonight in London so, thanks UK :)
Just want to say thank you to Great Britain for your commitment to meringue. #EtonMess #Pavlova
@cupcakebhouse Whoa!! And there I was thinking I was totally incognito. That's such a weird tweet to see later on in the day. Haha. Busted!
Charlie Brooker's Touch Of Cloth is HILARIOUS. Also, I just found out what that expression means... you Brits are gross.

Whoa whoa guys I wasn't IN the show, those actors just did that to me in my seat. (Wouldn't have BROUGHT my mom if I'd known what it was)
To the people asking about it, two "boogie nights" actors did fake lines of coke off my leg, so yeah, it was a fun show. (Again, sorry mom)
Last night - a musical romp through the films of PT Anderson at Rockwell. An amazing time. Thanks for being a good sport Mom. :-|
@joe_swanberg haha! Scientists should be more like rappers or boxers and talk shit all the time. Kids would really get more engaged.
@Aaron_Eddy Aaron Eddy!! I JUST moved. I hope I still get credit for staying in that place for like 8 years. Miss you dude! hope you're well
@joe_swanberg You don't fool me sir, you are trapped in a hotel somewhere and misery loves company. Nice try!
@adamstovall Second suggestion sounds like a plan
My mom's flight got screwed up so now she'll get in tomorrow. I have to keep my place clean for ANOTHER 24 hours? God help me.
@BenSPLATT you are my favorite. PS is your icon a picture of a picture? You kids these days... is it laziness or irony? I can't ever tell!!!
the other person's life is pretty stable and easy and the characters don't grow or learn anything. #BillionDollarIdea @thomaslennon

@joe_swanberg GOD you are the NEEDIEST director I've ever come across. You'll be the death of me Swanberg!!!! *shakes fist*
I literally had to imagine I had a penis to get through it.
In other news, I just had to try to rap like Dr Dre in a recording studio. Hands down the worst thing I've ever had to do for my job.
@joe_swanberg Don't be nervous! The key to twitter is to just always say something substantial and eloquent. I mean that's what I try to do.
Wait... I just realized I only have one point of reference for humor.... and ..... everything else.  I need to go... not watch a movie.....

Good news - I'm not dead in a ditch.  Bad news - I'm going to try to make up for twitter absence by tweeting an annoying amount starting now
While my twitter URL pic was probably the cleverest thing I'll ever think of I'll retire it soon... moving up to a non-phone pic in 2012
Saw High Society on the big screen for the first time tonight thanks to the BFI. Feeling all warm and fuzzy inside and whatnot and so forth.
That awkward moment when you tune in to a conversation on: "Oh, I looove colon cleansers." #PokerFaceChallenge
Co-worker has just informed me last tweet was confusing. Those are song lyrics... just stuck in my head... not a weird personal mantra.
Going around in my head: *nerdy girls, you are attracted to us!*  Failing to contain dorky bounce. Lock it up Kendrick.

I'm on Chelsea Lately tonight! I'm on Ellen tomorrow with the whole cast of 50/50! I'm taking over television!!!!!! #EvilLaugh
Okay, I felt too bad to post actual conversation. As he left I said, "You're famous on twitter now" under my breath. He looked confused.
Man making long, loud calls in a quiet sitting area bothering everyone. Should I post everything he's saying to twitter to punish him? Hmmmm
Hotel I'm in calls its weight-sensitive, auto-charging minibar an "Honor Bar" Cheeky & ironic? Or should I leave a dictionary at front desk?
Just a cold but I'm being all dramatic and channeling Syrio Forel...... "Not today....."    #gameofthrones

So my doctor just said "drink some echinacea, it probably doesn't do anything, but sometimes it's all mental" But dude, you JUST RUINED it.
Don't try to explain it Twitter!  What did I JUST say??
Every time someone tries to explain iCloud to me I immediately want to curl up in the fetal position and pop in a VHS.
@DashboardDiary Totally googled slowpoke meme. U have further illustrated my point sir (It's 2 late 2 pretend I knew that one before right?)
Although the fact that I JUST discovered it would make me more of a Technologically Impaired Duck #TryingToSoundHipByMentioningSecondMeme

Dear Oregon coast, I get it, you are the most beautiful thing I'll ever see. You win. Well played sir....... don't get smug.
If your remote hotel mysteriously never has web or cell service are u in a horror film? Should I open the bathroom mirror and kick this off?
Kristen Wiig's impression of a penis is both funny and extremely accurate. Bridesmaids should be shown in sex ed.

What is there to say? Footage is horrifying, gut wrenching. Thoughts and prayers with japan.

The phrase "Craigslist Killer" is trending... is this about a movie? Or my old roommate?
How is Misfits such a great show with such an unlikeable brat for a main character? Gives me hope for a movie of my life.
Wait... Polly Pocket is now almost 4 inches tall?? I reject this and feel sorry for future generations. SO off my Christmas list.
Tomorrow's turkey has a few stray feathers. Plucking them is so eerily reminiscent of Black Swan I swear I can feel my eyes going blood red.

"Kings of Pastry" = a scrappy little movie, but so tense it's like The Hurt Locker if it made you hungry. I gasped audibly more than once.
I just cashed my check for $18.40 for jury duty service. Oh, that's right, ramen noodles on me tonight gentlemen. You're welcome.
And thanks to all who came out to Scott Pilgrim at @newbeverly You sure know how to make the creator, director, DP and 10 cast feel welcome
Social Network - even better 2nd time. Eisenberg, Mara: perfect. Garfield: as always, so endearing I want to carry him around in my pocket.

On the comic con express with the Scott Pilgrim gang. Feels like the train to geek boarding school :)
On Sat it's a year since I joined Twitter. I've yet to reach 100 tweets. Going to try to remedy this at #sdcc this weekend. Can't wait.

I am also picking off the last of my blue nail polish before we get to this event. I give it 5 mins before I get kicked out.
I'm currently giving my home state's senator Susan Collins a ride. Coolest moment ever.
Oh @newbeverly I think I missed you most of all.
SO excited I got to see Conan live last night. Amazing show. Though I may have been more star struck by LaBamba.
@BUpshaw Wish I had - want to do that all the time at LAX anyway
LAX security woman just demanded to know where my guardian was. Now "You look young" is a compliment. "Did you lose your mom?" = Fail.
Deal. With. This.  http://tinyurl.com/pilgrimtlr
http://twitpic.com/18iqk8 - I. Love. It. Here.
Apparently I am now on my way to Tokyo. (Don't be jealous Vancouver... you know I can't stay away)
Ah... home sweet second-home. Nothing like being back at work, especially back in Canada. *rock-star-voice* GOODNIGHT!
Shocked I slept at all last night. Oscar related exhaustion outweighed Oscar related anxiety :)  Nervous, excited, thrilled, terrified etc
E Online has a "guys in ties" gallery? Is that like girls in bikinis? Do housewives think: "check out the tie on THAT nice young man" ?
Movie Poster Mash-up! Surprised Vera and I weren't replaced by Kevin and Dug :-) http://tinyurl.com/yartvq9
It's a week since oscar noms came out and my place is starting to look like a graveyard of floral arrangements. Sad face.
I'd love to say that 140 characters couldn't cover how I'm feeling right now but I'm honestly speechless :)
Up in the Air on Oprah today!
Been watching Sundance video reviews online for the last hour. I am being crushed under the weight of my envy.
HUGE congrats to Jason for his screenplay win!!! Tonight was incredible, and I met the voice of Doug from UP!  Not bad :)
Up in the Air is playing nationwide today - get your cute butts into a local theater!
Thank you for all the congratulations! I'm SO excited! And congrats to Jason, George and Vera!!!!!
@radiomaru oh... awkward... did no one tell you that's how Universal is billing it now? I mean, I did work four whole weeks on it.
Just finished taping Letterman. If you were there and I didn't get to sign for you I'm genuinely so sorry!! New to this/was shaking cold!
I'm on Letterman tonight. So nervous it's ridiculous! Tune in and send good vibes!!
Calories don't count in airports. Being trapped in LAX earns you a guilt free cinnabon. #MyTravelRules #UpInTheAir http://bit.ly/8YHa68
Save yourself ten minutes and don't get in line behind ME. #MyTravelRules #UpInTheAir http://bit.ly/8YHa68
Bring your favorite movie and watch it with commentary. Very relaxing. #MyTravelRules #UpInTheAir http://bit.ly/8YHa68
Aw, here's an "artist on artist" interview I did with Sad Brad. He was nice. And not that sad. http://bit.ly/PLmhf
I'm doing the Today Show tomorrow morning so if you're up at 8am you can watch me trying not to be nervous :)
Now on the sincerest note I can muster, I have SO much to be thankful for this year, I hope everyone is having a wonderful thanksgiving.
Dear London shops, cranberries and pumpkin = delicious and good for you, thanksgiving or not. *cough... take the hint*  Love, Anna :)
There's *something* I'm supposed to do tonight..... I've laid out a dress and ear plugs...... but why...
Holy airborne press junket batman. That was crazy. Thank you to everyone who came out!! We should all fly across the country again soon.
Was just sent this clip: http://bit.ly/48tXXi and by the end I saw why. RELIEVED and genuinely thrilled! :)
However briefly, I (albeit as Jessica) was spoofed on SNL last night. Best. Day. Ever.
Come on Maine, make me proud today! My folks have already made sure to #VoteNoOn1 .... have you?
A friend of mine who knows nothing about Twilight told some girl in Vegas he was in Eclipse so he could make out with her. Genius.
Finally back in LA with a few fleeting moments to breathe = first stop @newbeverly
Look Mom! I'm in a movie with George Clooney! And I'm mean to him! (From Up in the Air - hope you enjoy)  http://tinyurl.com/yhn5u93
On hold in Vancouver today. The Informant! A Serious Man. Where the Wild Things Are. All in all, not a bad day. Last day of shooting tmrw.
About to get on a plane for London Film Festival. Every time I go through airport security it feels like a publicity stunt for Up in the Air
Been a gorgeous gray morning in NYC. Traveling to Hamptons Film Festival in a few minutes.
Up in the Air full trailer: http://bit.ly/3ws1uC
Got to watch a little of the scoring session for new moon at George Martin Air recording studios w/ London symphony. RAD. Seeing film today.
Did ADR for New Moon yesterday. Saw all of 30 seconds but I can say we are VERY well lit.
Staying at TIFF longer so I can actually see some films! Solo screenings in sneakers far less scary than this red carpet madness. Very happy

Have had some concern about my "love life" over last comment. Just a good quote :)  Settle down now.
"I'd drop a guy for a film. I'd never drop a film for a guy!"
Today's imdb poll re: casting of Bilbo Baggins. I just love the fact that Zac Efron and Simon Pegg are on the same list for anything.
Toronto Film Festival. T-minus two weeks.
RT: @torn_portfolio Aubrey Heartburn? ;)  - No, but that's actually far funnier. I love the effort.
Vancouver alias misheard = staying under a hilarious typo version of one of the most remarkable actresses ever to grace silver screen

Just did some ADR for "Up in the Air". You'd think by now I'd be able to do ADR without thinking "Is THAT what I sound like?" Not so.
3 layers of génoise, jam, pastry cream. Wrapped in marzipan. Yeah, I said it.  Thanks for birthday wishes. Feel way cooler than I should.
Gasp! Bon Iver on the New Moon soundtrack? I'm always the last to know....
I'm being told the "followers" problem is currently being worked on... we'll see. (Sorry, I promise I'll attempt interesting tweets soon)
And.... what happened? Twitter is acting up apparently... not sure what's going on... um, help?
(Tweets thus far are RIVETING, no?)
4.I am not on Myspace, Facebook or any other social networking site. If u see one, not me. Again, flattering (slightly baffling) but not me.
3.To clarify: annakendrick47 is my FIRST & only twitter. According to certain someone I "moved" here? So funny. And by funny I mean creepy.
2.Was asked why I didn’t just have account “verified”? Am twitter illiterate so not sure what that entails but phone pic was pretty easy :)
1.Must give a big thanks to Rachelle Lefevre and all the Twilight pages for their help getting the word out. Quite a community. Had no idea.
Seeeeee....... (this is the only twitter I have) http://twitpic.com/bixqn
I'll be honest, just created this to say that any other "twitter-ers" aren't me.  Flattering... just not me.
