@DemerittMichael Misleading. Makes it sound like it was the catsuit. It wasn’t, it was the full Borg suit. The neck was too tight with the latex prosthetic for the bald cap and pressed on my carotid artery when I turned my head. They fixed it when they realized it was a problem.
Keep it going!! Let’s do this! https://t.co/sZFCSdGqJS
