If you are being your authentic self every single day, you have absolutely NOTHING to worry about.
Obviously 🙏🏻 https://t.co/O7qJzrGmTZ
I truly don’t care if I have any at all. I am normal person. I happened to make music at one time. I am only happy I was able to inspire people at the end of the day. ❤️ https://t.co/hXdFqIVze9
Lost a lot of followers for sticking up for what is right. I have ZERO problem with that.🤘🏻
Life is SO hard. Instead of tearing people down, we should support each other. Love each other. Give each other the benefit of the doubt. #AllWeNeedisLove

I have a few new songs that I might release...... should I?
Secrets make you Sick.
I am such a supporter of @Bethenny working your ass off and succeeding! Millennials have a misconstrued perception of what it actually takes to make it! #1FAN
@CaroleRadziwill Please get an actual life. Red scarf guy isn't into you. Bethenny is much more successful than you will ever be, and younger! Imagine that!
Thanks lady. I never cared about "being famous" that isn't what is truly important in life. It's about serving others and making a change in the world! https://t.co/nX2iEHg22t
So sick of fake "Hollywood" people. The wanabies are the ones who end up sucking the life out of you, all for what? For themselves. 💯.
When all you're worried about is your reputation, I guess you'll say just about anything including lies.....
I agree! Lay off Carole!!!!!! @Bethenny I am so sorry for your loss. Lifting you up in prayer. 🙏🏻😥 https://t.co/Vs9GGBUoCU
I clearly don't tweet that much anymore, but want to say how thankful I am for life. My husband. My family. For you guys. ❤️
Thank god. You are the OG queen and the only reason I watch! Carole was depressing me this season. She wants to be 24 and she's 54.... kinda creeped me out! https://t.co/jiZxcH66Nh
LA.  You were so bad to me in every way possible when I lived there. You broke my heart, drained my bank account with astronomically priced rent, made me constantly anxious from the every… https://t.co/jgKtcKCuqP
@alyandajtunes Exactly. Instead we judge people for their actions without truly knowing someone's situation. I believe in showing all grace and kindness ❤️
@EvelynIversen3 I feel you girl. I battled with depression on and off for a few years. Praying for you🙏🏻
Depression is not a choice. Addiction is not a choice. Keep your judgement to yourself.
#HowDemiHasHelpedMe She allowed me to be a part of her 2009 headlining tour as her opening act. That tour changed my life and I will be forever grateful to her.
Be KIND to everyone, for we are all fighting our own battles.🙏🏻
Thank you beautiful ❤️ https://t.co/wICRYdf6Al
Absolutely heartbroken to read the news about @ddlovato my thoughts and prayers are lifting you up girl. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 #prayforDemi

LOVE PEOPLE. How hard is that?
This shit has got to change in this country. The amount of evil and hate that we have let in is disgusting, and this country needs a MAJOR change.
Why do we sit with our cameras,  and film when something bad happens? Why are we so removed that we don't do anything to help other HUMANS????
Can I come too😂💥 https://t.co/xx6uqjYKxT

Did something really cool yesterday and can't wait to launch my new project soon... Stay Tuned https://t.co/nOuo0ykUIA
A lot of people walk around pretending to be something they're not. Putting on a front because they are scared to show who they are...
Ha!!! 😂 https://t.co/CW7JRGnaXH
Crazy that people who can't write songs, don't play an instrument, and can't carry a tune can become a successful "musician", Good for them. 🕺🏼

@scheana So sad to hear! You guys are fun to watch! Haters gonna hate! Keep shining pretty lady!
After much prayer, I have decided to retire from music. What a fantastic journey this has been... My fans, you have truly put magic into my life. I will cherish every show I got to play for you all. Every lyric you've sang with me. Thank you for all the joy you've given me.
News Flash People! We are all allowed to have our own opinions.
The older I get, the less shits I give..
Also, @people whoever your editors are, they need to get their shit together. You guys consistently have grammatical errors on your site. #justsayin
Stand Up for what is Right.
All I'm thinking about today is how much food I'm going to consume tomorrow 🙈
Life is too short not to be happy. Happy every single day.
GIRL! @AdrienneBailon I love how honest you are about music, but you have the voice of an ANGEL and I will ALWAYS love your version of "My Shoes" way more than mine!!
#NowPlaying I Did Something Bad- @taylorswift13

So to her former manager (trying to spill tea because she's desperate for attention) get a life? The only one you're making look bad is YOU.
Not that I want to be involved but I went on tour with @AdrienneBailon and she was always sweet, CLASSY, and very professional. #fan

New Single coming out later this year once I launch my @PledgeMusic campaign https://t.co/uKw3lLjDpY
Crazy how 1 song can flood my mind with so many memories...
To me, @KaceyMusgraves music is the definition of true honest country music. She also works out at my gym and that's pretty cool too...
Is it just me or is it hot as hell in Nashville 😐
Can I just say... I CANNOT stop listening to @kramergirl new single. Girl you KILL THE GAME!!! 🔥
@damestilinski I ain't spilling any tea today lady .... 🤐
Been sick literally the ENTIRE WEEK. Kill me!  😅😐 why am I sick when I actually have stuff to accomplish?

I challenge each of you to give a hug to a stranger! The more we start spreading love throughout our communities the more change we will see
I'm starting the #GiveAHug challenge. We don't love each other enough and we sure as hell don't show it!
I re-read those last two tweets just to make sure there weren't any typos.... #INEEDCOFFEE #whatislife 🙄
Like it was a struggle to even type that last tweet without coffee...
I haven't had coffee and I'm not feeling like a human...
I ask each and every one of you today to respect each other, be kind to each other and most importantly to love each other.
Good will always prevail over evil.
The happiest day for me? The day I don't see any political rants on Facebook.
TGIF BABY

Okay enough drama for tonight. I have a margarita I need to drink. Night y'all. ✌🏻️
People are CRUEL. You sit behind your computer and you type. What if your Mom saw what you were tweeting, think she would be proud of you?
Occasionally lol 😂 https://t.co/suS2DO3EXZ
What happened to respecting others even if they have a difference of opinion? That's what makes us beautiful, because we are all DIFFERENT.
A hero is a person who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.
I was lucky enough to tour with @ddlovato a while ago, and she is nothing but HONEST, kind and true talent. The end.
Leave this girl alone y'all. She's always kept it REAL. And um what happened to freedom of speech? Haters be jealous. https://t.co/ihjaJIfiRc

Sitting in Beverly Hills at a cute restaurant hearing random people talk about buying diamonds and getting a blow out... Hard life..
Oh and Hey LA!!!! Wassup?
Oooooeeeee! This LA weather feels incredible.
Also for the record, a similar drum beat and a few guitar riffs do NOT add up to plagiarism...
No offense to anyone, but I just listened to the song that @sleighbells thinks @ddlovato plagiarized? Sounds NOTHING ALIKE... Smh.
Singers! I'm looking for ppl who are inspired, driven and motivated to work!!! Sign up for my vocal sessions at https://t.co/bc79vottQt

I also hope that the police involved get the necessary punishment (a life sentence) as this is MURDER. We cannot let them get away with this
Something HAS to change. I am disgusted by the news I've seen. I am praying for all families involved in these senseless acts of violence.

@kaylaaa0914 @jtimberlake EXACTLY. People don't know why they are mad because they have zero reason to be!!!! Ha!
@kaylaaa0914 @jtimberlake So you're saying just because Justin is "white" he can't agree and be inspired by what he had to say? Smh....
John 15:12 "This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you."
So @jtimberlake says he's "inspired" and somehow it becomes a topic about race (AGAIN)Sometimes I think this country is still in 1960s...
People can't wait to misinterpret or misunderstand someone so they can be nasty... What is wrong with people

There so many evil people in this world but today we must remember there are far more good people than there are bad.
Can't preach that gay people are going to hell then tweet that your prayers go out to the families in Orlando. Love is not a light switch.
Super pumped to start recording my new album soon. Cannot wait for my #PRUsaders to hear it. ❤️

Psalms 23:4  Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid. You are with me. Your shepherd's rod and staff comfort me.
But we won't stop going to concerts. We won't stop going to the movies. We won't stop going to school. We won't live in fear.
I am so shocked and saddened to hear the news of Christina Grimmie's passing. My heart and prayers are with her family. ❤️

The only thing I'll be seeing today is a treadmill in front of me...
Happy Thanksgiving! Thankful for my beautiful family and equally thankful for YOU guys!
Today I give thanks for every wonderful human in my life. Each person is such a Blessing. #happythanksgiving
Warning: Do NOT wear high waisted pants while eating a Thanksgiving meal.... In pain.
A hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself.
I can't give you a sure-fire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time.
Sick of being sick 😭😁

My anxiety is on another level today 😩
Chances are that when someone is hating on you, it’s not about you. It’s about them. It’s their fear, their jealously, and their insecurity.
Love me or hate me I’m still gonna shine.
Dedicated to @paulasimonetti0 Have fun at the @nickjonas concert this weekend! #Levels #Nickjonas https://t.co/h6HDOqln6Y
I am SO EXCITED to see @thenbhd tonight at @TheRyman 💃🏼❤️
My fans constantly keep me going and I WON'T let you all down.
A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.
I don't forgive people cause I'm weak, I forgive them cause I'm strong enough to understand people make mistakes.

If we don't change, we don't grow. If we don't grow, we aren't really living.
Love is not just looking at each other, it's looking in the same direction.
Forget yesterday - it has already forgotten you. Don't sweat tomorrow - you haven't even met. Instead, open your heart to a gift - today.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
Cannot wait for my photoshoot with my favorite photographer!!! @davidbean

When we share what we were brought here to give, we are in alignment with our highest, most powerful selves.
Watching someone else totally go for it can be incredibly upsetting to the person who's spent a lifetime building a case for why they can't.

Girls. You don't have to take off your clothes for attention. Be Classy, not desperate. #Truth
True Talent doesn't need shock value. #Music
People demand freedom of speech to make up for the freedom of thought which they avoid.

Successful people are always looking for opportunities to help others. Unsuccessful people are always asking, "What's in it for me?
Great achievement is usually born of great sacrifice, and is never the result of selfishness.

Being someone’s first love may be great, but to be their last is beyond perfect.
You’ll never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret to your success is found in your daily routine.
The reason most people give up is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go, instead of how far they have come.
The problem that we have with a victim mentality is that we forget to see our blessings. Our spirit is poisoned instead of nourished. #truth

That awkward moment when you’ve said “What?” three times and still have no idea what the person is talking about, so you just agree.

Relationships last for a long time because two people make a choice: to keep it, fight for it, and work for it.
The greatest mistake we humans make in our relationships; We listen half, understand quarter, think zero, and react double.

To all the girls that think you’re ugly because you’re not a size zero, you’re the beautiful one, its society who’s ugly.
I am thankful for the difficult people in my life, they have shown me exactly who I do not want to be.
Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder.
People’s words affect you only as much as you let them.
Don’t let anyone’s ignorance, hate, drama, or negativity stop you from being the best person you can be
When you judge me without knowing me, you do not define me, you define yourself.
Pay no mind to those who talk behind your back, it simply means you are two steps ahead.
Worry about your character, not your reputation. Your character is who you are. Your reputation is who people think you are #quotes
