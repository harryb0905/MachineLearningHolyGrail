Bogged down with email. Halp! Wish emails had to be constructed so that the only possible response would be "yes" or "no."

@Dealfatigue next time, if the breasts are done, take them out and carve them off and keep cooking legs to 160.
@Dealfatigue It sounds like perhaps the disposable broiler pan doesn't conduct heat very well and so the legs weren't getting enough.

@AfroLatinoChef just threw one of those away yesterday!
Confession: when I see cheap/ugly pens lying around, I just throw them away.

@JilNelson thanks -- glad you did!
Getting so much work done ... because the Oscars are such a snooze.

I've been to Les Mis in London twice. Still don't get what the story is about. This is not helping.
Jennifer Aniston hasn't changed her hair in 20 years. Maybe that's an accomplishment.
