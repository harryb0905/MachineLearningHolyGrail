Don’t get it twisted, it wasn’t just Baylor’s size &amp; length that gave UConn problems. It was their quickness &amp; intelligence. Guards couldn’t manufacture clean looks. One of the best defensive performances I’ve seen in a long time.

@ElaineVigneault You could play on the road that game
@rinjr715 @WNBA Not as concerned with pulling stars as I am with allowing teams to get home the evening of their game.  Baseball has charter flights so time of first pitch is a non issue for them.
I like this momentum 🔥 https://t.co/VQ5o9qKVfz
@marcsquire Get off my timeline marc 😂😂❤️
Anyone else out here checking @seattlestorm players Instagram accounts today?
I also believe the 1st round should begin Thursday (instead of Tuesday), 2nd round Sunday, and the rest of the television windows progress as normal. There would be one additional window needed at the end for Game 5 of the Finals.
Without overhauling format, there’s an easy fix the @WNBA could make in the regular season.   All teams tip at 3pm est the last Sunday of the regular season.   All teams play a natural geographic partner, providing away teams ability to return home that same evening.
@Da20one 😂😂😂
@Da20one Nee I don't think I did anything to be saluted! I'm excited to see you guys on Sunday, Smoothie is excited too

@jclang81 Was going with current players, since I didn’t sit courtside and watch Bird/Magic
@SpliffsofWizdom Now you know I love TP ❤️
@broncm1 Nah just don’t have them in my top tier
@BallBucketz CP3=incredible, just don’t have him in my top tier
@mr_ice 👊
@cljskis Reasonable minds can differ, Birdy is a great passer, just don’t have her in my top tier.
@Shlaney03 Pretty amazing stat
@SoDak_Land_Sky Special talent
@SusanLarson6 👊
@outRAGEous02 My guy!
@sgb916 White Chocolate! Was talking current players but nice blast from the last!
@shepherdsusan Truth!
@huskynation1 👊
@cromwell32 👊
@_damola_L Lonzo has special vision, doesn’t manipulate the game as well as other two yet
@KHoss123 Great passer, don’t have her in my top tier with those two
@TheMHLewis Score confused me, stats guy said it was right though
@CoolBreeze1865 She has a great case
@vanwhoo22 Love Birdy, don’t have her in my top tier, but she’s def one of the best out there
@14_CK Bruh
@Shawn84175996 Pass fake was sick
@aaronleedowell Great passer, just don’t have her in top tier with those 2
@americanhp 👊
@tre_dobbins Agreed, definitely are other tiers below, but enough characters for that! Those two are my top tier!
@1PMChannel Coop was a killer, but not in same class as a passer as DT imo
@HendrenWillis Thanks bro!
@RevKG Do I detect the sarcasm font?
@TacieLeBeaux12 Passing isn’t just assists, it’s forecasting, ability to put the ball exactly where it needs to be from different lengths, angles, DT’s hands, wrists, height set her apart imo
@terrypope1 CP3 is amazing too, reasonable to have him on your level 1, he’s just not on mine, I just have those 2.
@xplrer99 Hahaha
@chasitymelvin Big Steph fan, don’t have him with those two, but reasonable minds can differ 😉
@BBallMajor Amazing players!
@tonyntotony Great season!

@DaveDuFourNBA Enjoying the convo Dave, if it's not an issue for players, then who is it an issue for?
@TheeMikeGregg Yes, they pick their own assistants, there will be 9 new coaches this season, wonder how many will interview a female for any one of their openings?
@Sigaba not trolling anyone just having a conservation
@DaveDuFourNBA agreed, Cheryl Reeve as well
@DaveDuFourNBA This extends to men's college hoops as well, women's college basketball has welcomed men with open arms and has gotten better because of their contributions but there has been no reciprocity on the men's side.
@TahWatson @NBA they're definitely not mutually exclusive, thanks for weighing in Taheed👊
@DaveDuFourNBA If you want to be the best in the world at something (I'm assuming every organization does) you don't swim in a pool of homogeneity. Diversity is what makes the NBA great. I hope this blind spot dissipates sooner rather than later.
@DaveDuFourNBA Agreed Dave, just has always been baffling to me that if Becky is working out as an assistant, why no one else would give another woman an opportunity, Becky's not the only woman with the goods, there are many that would flourish in an NBA environment
I'd be very interested to know of the interviewing process for assistant coaches for @NBA teams.  If the "pipeline" for head coaching opportunities goes thru being an assistant, why aren't more teams providing opportunities to qualified female candidates?
@WhoBothWhoBad yup
@WJBESports 💯
@hstgerard me too!
@wizardsfanreact Loved my season with the Wiz, a lot of learning and started to build some great relationships
@JDonaldsonNBCS 💯
@pranil101 Agreed!
@JarigdonJohn It's only a matter of time

Jonas Valanciunas has hurt the Wizards in 1st quarters this series. Thought it curious Casey hadn’t played him at all in 4th quarters prior to tonight. Came up big! Back to DC!
@FTiafoe Let’s go!!!!
The lineup the Wizards finished Game 4 with after Bradley Beal fouled out was (Wall, Oubre, Porter, Morris, Gortat)  Those five were not on the court together for any time at all in the 2017-18 regular season. (Per @EliasSports)
😳 https://t.co/Tnu9Uqe67O

@flyboygraphics Won the game twice last night! Good win for the guys!
@MJarominiak Good win last night!
@mrelemental1 Bro, if we talked about every rumor, we would never have time to call the game 😂 lots of stuff out there, but my job is to call what's on the court.
I can't tell you how enjoyable it has been to watch Mike Scott play on a daily basis. Makes quick decisions, moves the ball, sprints the floor, competes, and gets buckets! Wiz bench is better b/c of him!
@JulianneViani Good to see you Julianne! Keep shining!
