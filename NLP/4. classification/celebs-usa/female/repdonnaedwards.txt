Congress must change that &amp; help reduce the 9 American women shot &amp; killed by their husbands &amp; intimate partners every week. #DisarmHate
Tragically, our lax #gun laws make it easier for #domesticabusers to acquire a #firearm than it is to purchase a box of Sudafed. #DisarmHate
Finally, without a clear law on the books, 41 states do not require all  prohibited #domesticabusers to relinquish #guns they already own.
3rd, fed law (&amp; most state laws) allow domestic abusers &amp; stalkers to buy #guns from unlicensed, private sellers w/o #background checks.
2nd, N 35 states, state law doesn't prohibit all convicted of misdemeanor #DV crimes &amp; those w restraining orders from buying or using #guns
What loopholes w #DV offender #gun ban? 1st, fed law does nothing to keep #guns  out of abusive dating partners or convicted stalkers hands.
In states that require background checks for all handgun sales, 46 percent fewer women are murdered with a #gun by an intimate partner.
Research shows that common-sense gun laws have a marked effect on improving women‚Äôs safety from #gunviolence. #StoptheViolence
At least 52 percent of American women murdered with guns are killed by intimate partners or family members. #DisarmHate
As country, we've made progress in preventing #DV, but w mack truck size loopholes, there remains much more we can do to protect individuals

With adjournment, @SpeakerRyan sends House home until July 5th w/o votes on expanded #backgroundchecks &amp; NoFlyNoBuy. #NoBillNoBreak
AND appears House will adjourn w/o having vote to adjourn required under regular order. #GOP colleagues want out of town BAD? #NoBillNoBreak
Even lower than imagined. NO debate time on Rule or on #Zika Report.  Normally would be 1 hr on each, divided between 2 parties. #DisarmHate
Rule that @HouseGOP is using to bring up #Zika Conference Report provides for NO debate on the Report. Standard would be 1 hr. #WereJustDone
Then appears a vote 2 adjourn &amp; go home w/o doing any additional  work. We are scheduled 2 B in session both Thurs &amp; Fri w votes.  #Shame
Since we are in the minority, can never say w/ 100%. However, looks like @SpeakerRyan's plan is to come back in @ 2:30am &amp; pass #Zika bill.
.@HouseGOP came in &amp; we are now on a procedural vote to meet again around 2:30 am. This likely to be a straight-party line vote. #DisarmHate

Such changes in fed law in mid-‚Äò80s aided rise in # &amp; size of #gunshows. US has approximately 5,000 such shows annually. #GunSense
Before 1986 (FOPA), dealers were required to have fed firearms licenses (#FFLs) for each location at which they sold guns. #StopGunViolence
Firearms Owners‚Äô Protection Act (FOPA) allowed dealers 2 temporarily conduct business away from their normal place of business. #DoSomething

.@HouseGOP using the public health emergency de jour to enact HR 897. Years past West Nile Virus, wildfire suppression &amp; drought. Now #Zika.
New title of Zika Vector Control Act &amp; inclusion of a sunset date in 2018 are the only differences from previous iterations of this bill.
HR 897 would limit EPA regulation of pesticides under #CleanWaterAct that protects our waterways &amp; communities from excessive pollution.
Watch @cspan as I speak in opposition to HR 897, the incorrectly &amp; misleading renamed the Zika Vector Control Act. https://t.co/LrLbdijqdz

President Obama and his Administration made a Zika emergency funding request in February for $1.9 billion. Yet,Congress has yet to act.
The spread of the #Zika virus should not, must not be a partisan issue, and yet it seems to have been characterized that way.

This is a small, yet powerful step that could lead to significantly reducing the number of Americans killed by #firearms .
Since the 1970s, using the public health approach, we have reduced deaths from motor vehicle crashes by more than 70%.
We have a gun violence problem in the US. To address it, Americans deserve the facts &amp; Congress needs the scope and data of the epidemic.

#HR4441 would hand over billions of $ of taxpayer funded air traffic control assets (both facilities &amp; equipment) to a private corporation.

FT working mom earns just $14,500 @ min wage, &gt;$4,500 below poverty line for mom w/2 kids.Current #MinimumWage $7.25/hr is not a #LivingWage
It's the 6th anniversary of the last time the #minimumwage was raised. Today, min wage buys less than it did in 1950! We must #RaiseTheWage

It‚Äôs FAR past time for #NoMoreHashtags &amp; more than just another moment of silence.  It‚Äôs time for nat'l movement &amp; action on #gunviolence.
The needless #gunviolence continues w #Chattanooga &amp; #Lafayette. Heartbroken &amp; saddened for MORE families and victims. Thoughts &amp; prayers.
