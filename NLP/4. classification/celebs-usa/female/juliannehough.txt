Sometimes we don’t always know what self care entails or how to do it...  One of my favorite and simple things to do when I don’t have a ton of time is to simply touch my skin in a soft and nurturing way.  This always helps me connect back to me again. https://t.co/MB9AHOBA4v
Back at it! 👊 My daily pages never fail to keep me grounded &amp; sane (even though I’ll always be a little insane 🤪). My challenge for you guys is to write once a day for a week.

Meditation is so important to me. It helps me elevate &amp; expand. But, when I’m meditating with a group of people, I can sometimes take on their energy. If that ever happens to you, a quick tip is to place one hand up &amp; one hand down, that way the energy can pass right through you. https://t.co/TYzG84vEIs

With all of the traveling I’ve been doing, I’ve realized that it’s necessary to take a day to relax. Reconnect with yourself. Allow yourself to feel however you need to feel.
