i'm going to head off to the Ryman for rehearsal!  xoxo
Thanks for doing the twitter chat with me... @TNVacation I appreciate the support and I love showing off our beautiful state to visitors.
@vickschicks8 @TNVacation the BIG plan for 2017 is an Alaskan Cruise in July.  I'm so excited about the adventure it will be.
@vickschicks8 @TNVacation We are already making plans for a 2017 Christmas tour but I hope to do plenty of non-Christmas dates as well.
@Cheryl_Diebold @TNVacation Jen has shown me some of your posts.  I'm so glad it has been a good musical companion for you.
@Z925FM thanks for playing my songs! xo
@LightOutGabby @TNVacation I was given the demo of the song "Humble &amp; Kind" before Tim McGraw cut it.  The one that got away...
@Z925FM ladies first? :)
@LoraJaneMcKee this year at the Ryman Corrina and I have been singing "Grown Up Christmas List" together and I have loved it. She has pipes!
@anne_cascio @TNVacation i still love to ski.  however, long gone are the days i will do so without a helmet.  Safety over vanity :)
@mcy03970 @TNVacation ha.  @JenCooke asks me the same thing daily!  hopefully new music, if even just a single or ep in 2017.
@catfan91 @TNVacation hmmm.... let me think.
@janetpurple @TNVacation I'm a southern girl so I admit to loving our family cheese grits recipe.
@Cheryl_Diebold @TNVacation i'll follow but just know I rarely look at twitter other than to answer questions or do these chats.
@TNVacation I have Christmas shows up until the 22nd, so Christmas will be just much needed time at home with my family.
@LightOutGabby I never get tired of performing El Shaddai and Breath of Heaven.
@anne_cascio @TNVacation yes!  i love exploring although I usually get to do my best exploring on bike when we are in a city for a show.
@janetpurple @TNVacation there is nothing like experiencing Christmas through the eyes of a young child...
@TNVacation @mcy03970 @michaelwsmith and I have loved sharing the stage with @JordanSmithLive .  Hearing him sing every night is such a gift
@AcademicExcel @TNVacation  I still love crawling on a bus and hitting the road w/ my band.  Every show feels like a new experience.
@anne_cascio @TNVacation hmmm. let me think.  i hope my family remembers me as someone who listened to them and prayed for them.
@BeccaKnutson13 @TNVacation I'm not sure I can pick just one.  Hearing Jordan Smith sing O Holy Night on tour this year is something i love.
@janetpurple @TNVacation we have Christmas breakfast together every year.  And I take an annual Christmas picture of the kids.
@LightOutGabby I get this question a lot... Carole King, Joni Mitchell and James Taylor were huge musical influences.
@TayGregory @TNVacation ha.  no.  that was a one time thing that didn't last very long! xo
@TNVacation Probably the residency Vince and I do at The Ryman every Christmas...
@vickschicks8 @TNVacation that's sweet to read...  I'll follow :)
@vickschicks8 @TNVacation I mostly listened to singer-songwriters like Carole King, James Taylor and Joni Mitchell.
@mcy03970 Thanks Michael... it is a bit overwhelming but I'm trying! Thankfully Jen and Brooks help me a lot!
