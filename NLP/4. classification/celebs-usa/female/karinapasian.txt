If someone cares enough about you, they will engage deeper with you, gradually, over time. People who do not want to be revealed are more comfortable in superficial situations.
If you know me, you know I looove Christmas, especially Christmas songs. But "The 12 Days of Christmas"  ........NO. I can't stand this song

So should we keep striving for if it's essentially in vain? https://t.co/S5fxG5cMKz
Btw, the population has gone up by 4.5 billion since 1960. Holy shit
Before it got disrupted with imprinted thoughts and beliefs of those around us.
Isn't it interesting that we aren't able to remember how we viewed the world before we could speak and formed opinions? Might it be because we'd remember what it was like to see the world in its purest form?
If you think about it, there are actually 7.5 billion worlds. Every single person is living in their own unique view of it.
A bit pessimistic, I know. Just some random thoughts my brain happens to be perusing upon right now.
This leads me to believe our collective goal of world peace remains unattainable because we are all stuck in our own version of the world.
Other than while we are babies, I suppose?
We see the world through the filter of our beliefs/experiences - everything in our reality presents itself to us based off of what we want to see. There can't be a single accurate human depiction of our world as it is.
Being that we all take part in confirmation bias, will we ever actually know the falsity of what we perceive as truth?
Whooaaa https://t.co/1TFIxRoJMW
@Cory_Henry Ya feel me?!
I had an epiphany. I wrote it down and almost instantly tweeted it.
Some things are just too good to tweet.
"Sometimes we know what is best for ourselves yet we cling to old ways out of fear or comfort."

Late at night when all the world is sleeping......... 🎶
Such a brilliant melody. So mesmerizing
It's one of my faaavorite songs. But once I start humming it I can't stop. I've literally been singing it in a loop for the past 20 mins

@publicloyalty @nowthisnews #late
Sometimes relationships, projects, hopes and dreams have to hit bottom before you can see that there is nowhere left to go but up.
Being vulnerable &amp; open to receiving/giving love is scary....but the benefits are otherworldly.
There's nothing more beautiful than having that person you can fully trust. Someone who doesn't judge you and accepts you as you are.
When you give yourself love and the real permission to be all of you, conflicts will no longer scare you.
Problems are inevitably part of a relationship
Love is action, love is work, love is a decision.
Oh right!! If you are overseas you can now hear Interlude ☺️🙌🏽

It's a vicious cycle.
The more unhappy people there are, the more they can profit off of our unhappiness.
The more we neglect and suppress our feelings, the unhappier we become.
I believe society conditions us to neglect our feelings because it is actually our way to truth and joy
@IsraelTheILLa me too
Allow your feelings to show you the truth, instead of attempting to "figure it all out" in your head.
Sometimes there is no clear answer as to why you feel a certain way.…you just know you do.
People aren’t always distant because they don’t want to connect with us. They are sometimes distant because they want to, but don’t know how

@WalidAzami lmaoo you WILL NOT tell me what to do!!!! And I'm in NY 😢
Ok I'm done ranting.... for now
Our first gut instinct is always right.
Life gets in the way and the more time we take to decide, the more we start to overthink, and the cloudier our thoughts become
I'm so grateful for @AdrianYounge. We had a conversation that was the catalyst to me finally releasing my EP. He said "just put it out!" Lol
Overthinking interferes with creativity
That's been a strong lesson for me. And it affects my music
It's ok to ask for something clear and specific. Don't be afraid to ask BIG!! God will still give you more than you could've ever imagined.
Even though God already knows what we want, WE need to know what we want.
If you take too long to make a decision, life will make it for you.
I struggle with indecision a lot when it comes to things that really matter to me because I don't want to do the wrong thing
We keep getting less than we long for when we don't know what we want
Taking a little bit of everything bc we don't know what we want. And don't wanna "miss out on anything"
Don't live life like an "all you can eat buffet."
We wonder why God isn't acting on our behalf, but He needs to know what we want.
When you don't know what you want, you get what you don't want.

And he was white. So I made sure I was as extra as I could ever be 😂
It wasn't as offensive when I found out he really said "weave" but I had already went off on him so I had to stay consistent ya know
I said ....Oh. Idc. That's still ignorant and walked away
.....Come to find out he said "weave." Lol. Still rude.
Last night this guy asked me if I had weed in my locs. I told him that was the most ignorant disrespectful shit ever &amp; to stop talking to me

Your life cannot go forward if your mind is going backwards
Learning this more and more every day ✨
Self-love is the key to happiness and success in life.
It's not pride to think about urself the way God thinks about you, it's only pride when you start thinking that ur better than someone else.
Don't be afraid to tell yourself how wonderful and amazing you are. Get yourself thinking about yourself the way God thinks about you
You are never gonna live beyond what you believe about yourself.
Self sabotage is some reeeal shit
Everything always works out for our highest good.

Have your own mind. Believe in something because YOU do. Not because someone else told you to. It's more important than you'll ever know
I know first hand. Messed up PLENTY of situations for me. Every single time
The worst thing you can do is allow other people's thoughts dictate how you feel about something.
Anytime ☺️ RT @Sweetheart1001: Seriously Can't Stop Listening To These videos thank you so much @karinapasian ❤️
It's all coming full circle now yet still I'm incomplete.

a lot of you are saying you'd be threatened. why? would you rather them not tell you? or would you want to know?
what makes you think that? RT @BrandiseBeauty: @karinapasian it's just a cleverly crafted lie for them to have their cake and eat it too.
@three1ninetytwo hmm...what if you encounter someone who does? would you tell her?
RT @BombAzFuqk: @karinapasian threatened! That can lead to other things.
RT @ItsJaleelYoung: @karinapasian Threatened, cause I think that's BS.
lol! RT @BreezyTautMe: @karinapasian flattered. They love me so they have to find friends that are like me in order to enjoy their company 😊
what if you're not around at the moment, + they are? RT @creolexbaby: @karinapasian ....then you should just hang out ....with ME. what.
interesting... RT @kaNEiNAbEE: @karinapasian Neither, but I would remind them to be mindful of their actions.
i see. RT @kaylamillian: @karinapasian well, flattered because they're thinking of you and threatened because you never want your spot taken
how? RT @LyricCruise: @karinapasian that's a little insulting.. Lol
interesting. why? RT @kaylamillian: @karinapasian definitely a bit of both
your significant other tells u they like spending time w/ someone else only bc he/she reminds them of u. do u feel flattered? or threatened?
