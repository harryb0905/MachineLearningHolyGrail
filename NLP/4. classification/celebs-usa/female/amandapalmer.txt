@ThornburyRocks 2020. coming.
@EliKwake 😭💪🏼♥️
and if you want to see the work in progress...here are the TOUR DATES. i’m all over north america this spring and all over UK/europe in fall of 2019. solo piano, three hour show, lots of feelings, zero apologies. https://t.co/2ACWEfUZKs
classic first day of tour.   *finalizes setlist*  *rethinks entire plan, changes entire setlist*  *rethinks entire career*  *rethinks entire life*  *cries, agonizes, has another coffee*  *returns to original setlist* https://t.co/s12oWSNyhM
wow - thank you. the show was such a hot mess...i appreciate that it still won you over. i’d recommend starting with the @DresdenDolls’ self-titled record, then Who Killed Amanda Palmer, my first solo album. those are great starting records. &amp; i’ll let the people here chime in. https://t.co/u6PddycezV
🎉 https://t.co/5ZAxDQfMlc
i am not saying it is a good thing in itself. it sucks, when it happens. but sometimes we choose - and it happens. as a community, we need rituals to take care of one another in those fragile moments. that’s the point. so many women just walk around carrying useless shame, alone. https://t.co/KDd1sKeeik
such a great question. that would be a genuine toss-up between diamanda galás, dagmar krause, kathy acker and @Miranda_July. and @toriamos. and @anidifranco. and @Hannahgadsby. and @margaretcho. https://t.co/KhrF64b8eS

you’re so welcome. it will help others. maybe dozens, maybe millions, it doesn’t matter. what matters is that you heal, and then you help. and if it motivates you, send it when you’re done, please, so we can listen. i’ll post it here. https://t.co/pExvl3SQ2D
yes yes and yes. DM me. https://t.co/JKyjaNVUcS
over 500 people joined my patreon in the last week. with all the people yelling at me about stuff, i have to say, it shores me up. if you’re new, thank you for taking the plunge to support me full time, even if it’s just $1. it means a lot. if you wanna: https://t.co/StKQnUYJqk
@The_Anchoress @marjanasemkina oh my god i love you all. musical sisterhood in full effect. 💥
aw fuck yes you can have a hug. i am so proud of you for even going there. the song has opened something up...so let it open, let it bleed, it’ll help you heal. the song and the studio will still be there tomorrow. thanks for asking. hugs here, always. ♥️🎡 https://t.co/4rwFkcBQpc

i fully support later-term abortions when it’s clearly going to prevent oncoming suffering/death of either mother or fetus. harrowing decisions, all, and i feel for anybody who has to face those choices, no matter what. https://t.co/3oatmTlMBZ
@mis_cue @AliceLBronte @DollyParton @guardian @HadleyFreeman LIFE IS FULL OF NUANCE!
@ParkerMolloy that’s massively unfair, and is based on the assumption that 1) i research the backgrounds of writers/journalists before i tweet their articles (i don’t) and 2) that the quote from dolly parton can’t be separated from the interviewer (it can). play fair, here, please. x
@judyblume @HadleyFreeman must. read!! thanks judy !! xx
here’s the link to the entire interview/article. (which is nuanced, smart &amp; fantastically written by the way, bravo @HadleyFreeman.) https://t.co/9Qv0COh7Lb
in closing: i’d rather get nailed to a career-cross with the truth on my lips than sail to the top of the charts with a polite smile.   WE CAN’T WASTE ANY MORE TIME.   SPEAK OUT.  SPEAK OUT.   FOR FUCKS SAKE  SPEAK OUT.
...in 2019, with global fascism on the rise, US abortion rights vanishing, and climate chaos looming over our heads and our kids’ heads like a heavy sword, i respect myself - and my audience - right now too much to NOT tell the fucking truth.
not that i was ever in danger of becoming a mainstream star (that’s a laugh), but this record/tour i’m about to do is no doubt going to be the final nail in that imaginary coffin. and it’s fine. because....
but: our planet is dying and women telling the bare-faced unapologetic  truth - without trying to please anyone anymore - is the one of the few potential miracle cures we’ve got on the table right now.
did i read that right?  i respect myself too much to speak out?  i respect my audience too much to speak out?  wait what? how does that work?   and, i mean, she’s right.   you cannot be politically vocal AND a universally beloved mainstream star, appealing to everybody....
{thread} ready to watch me ruin my career? okay! re: this quote from @DollyParton published in the @guardian with @HadleyFreeman.   all respect to dolly - a truly great, immensely inspiring writer and performer - but FUCK this attitude. FUCK IT TO PIECES. why? https://t.co/ujWWx3gVQQ
that is beautiful - thank you for sharing ... https://t.co/AX0g1bFoAy
hi gerry. as much as i respect a lot of her work, i’m just not with mother teresa on this one. extra note: i love that when her journals were made posthumously public, she was found to be as neurotic &amp; filled with doubt as the average person. that should be comforting to everyone https://t.co/TQmrA0yakI
exactly. part of the problem with so many things in our culture...abortion, miscarriage, birth, death...are missing crucial together-rituals of transition, acknowledgement, grief, acceptance. women think they need to just bleed, deal and go back to work the next day in silence. https://t.co/dvCs1aS5qp

this, this, a thousand times this. the song isn’t about going “yay! abortion is rad!” ... it’s about chipping away at secrecy, shame and stigma. https://t.co/IfX5U79VU9
thank you. i didn’t know what to expect but it doesn’t surprise me. this is a very personal hot topic for a lot of people, obviously. i hope we can make some progress - at least in the understanding &amp; communication department. https://t.co/L1JzPHDFVv
@becasilverstein that looks like a baby in a NICU to me. the vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester of pregnancy. in rare cases, abortions happen later to protect a woman’s health, and sometimes there are difficult choices when a fetus is compromised. the key word is choice. x
you may have read the article, but have you listened to the song? i think that’ll help you understand. https://t.co/A5YGPLxGaP
hey becca, it’s amanda. i want to discuss these things, and i always welcome open discussion on my feed. i think it’s really important for us all to talk about this stuff. but please refrain from using insults. it doesn’t help us try to understand one another’s points of view. 🙏🏼 https://t.co/LOWb1AiO8n

this is a great question, so please RT, everyone. i really wouldn’t recommend this show for kids under about 14/15 years old. there are graphic stories about death, abortion &amp; miscarriage. really important and powerful for teenagers, but the younger ones...probably too adult. https://t.co/E4v02bZTb7

@KEBrightbill when i was about 9, i convinced 6 girls in my neighborhood to allow me to direct them in a no-budget porch production of “fiddler on the roof”. i played tevye, obviously. kim whittemore played my wife, golde. i wonder where kim is now.
@frillydoomsday ♥️🌠
both @toriamos and @anidifranco directly fueled the truth-telling on this record. and it’s not a coincidence that they were both artists i felt allergic to as a teenager. i think their unapologetic brands truth scared me; i just wasn’t ready. and now they are both heroes of mine. https://t.co/SnsMSYS5ig

nobody “celebrates” the act of abortion. it’s not something women deliberately race to do filled with joy &amp; enthusiasm. but the act of making that choice, of standing strong in your center &amp; holding that complex set of emotions...that act of bravery, indeed, deserves celebrating. https://t.co/LTBBwobAMR

such a great, diverse list...with tons of women as well (hey @kristinhersh!!) and it just goes to show how incredibly great the song-craft and songwriting of nirvana was. cc’ing my grand theft orchestra loves @quilken &amp; @radchaines - this was our first studio recording as a band https://t.co/HEVXVeW3GA

YEAH 💥💥🍷 https://t.co/WDWT5xoDJ7
as someone who’s bisexual (i prefer “all-sexual” or, in the words of the wise @margaretcho, just “slutty”) i’ve dealt with the same internalized garbage. it’s a lifelong project to jettison it all. xx https://t.co/sGz1yaSZIF
@LaurenceRanking i appreciate that. x
@JordanRasko @Starmongoose this has so much wisdom in it. your collected wisdom, and mine...these are the kinds of true conversations that are going to slowy and incrementally change the world into a better fucking place. not the giant black/white yelling. the quiet, compassionate allowance of growth. ♥️
@amarl 🍷
@ashleydactyl ughhhhhhg noooo
@redgoldrush unfortunately, it’s not like a guitar or a ukulele ... string-replacing is a job for piano tuners. it’s like the equivalent of trying to replace an entire carburator. you just don’t wanna do that shit yourself.
help: what's an example of the WORST/sexist/cheeseball crap that the world children's corporate entertainment and merchandising has to offer?
@joshmbyerly i am anticipating a few broken steinways on this tour. it’s gonna be weird.
@ninedragons die beste.
speaking of good omens...just snapped a piano bass string while rehearsing the show. it’s gonna be a great fuckin tour i’ll tell you what. (for you piano geeks: that’s a C2 string. blammo.) #therewillbenointermission #pianoslayer https://t.co/z9Y2Wlkrk1
@Lyrikris10 hi kristen! what's the best email to reach you at...can you DM me?
@Inusaito that line was more about pregnancy than anything - the inability to hide a growing belly. all of those lines, though, are so open to interpretation...that's why the song still remains so powerful for me. it's...everything and nothing all at once. it's art. art is great that way.
@JordanRasko this is IT. i wasn't "phobic" so much as 23, fearing the fears *i* feared my friends had. they reminded me of things i was experiencing: abortion, the cloud around my lost virginity, and more. i piled them into one song. it's not a song i'd write now that i know what i know. 🙏
ach, bruno ganz. der himmel über berlin  war der 1st Film der mir gezeigt hat wie kunst bis ins innerste reicht. „Nennt mir die Männer &amp; Frauen &amp; Kinder, die mich suchen werden, mich, ihren Erzähler, Vorsänger &amp; Tonangeber, weil sie mich brauchen wie sonst nichts auf der Welt.“😭 https://t.co/cHzAsqtZ7M
also....nick cave &amp; the bad seeds shredded that bar scene with "from her to eternity". this film = best use of a live band EVER.
oh man...RIP Bruno Ganz. #WingsOfDesire was the first film i saw as a teen that showed me how art can reach right into the core of your heart. "name me the men and women and children who will search for me, their storyteller...because they need me like nothing else in the world." https://t.co/wVgmmyhhjx
@dy570p14n i know. i’d defend that song and its multi-leveled-interpretable lyrics to the death. i don’t think there’s anything remotely transphobic about it. art explores complex feelings &amp; confusions about our human experience like nothing else can. we shouldn’t censor those explorations.
@revsean that’ll be a great one!! end of tour magic.
i know. i’d defend that song and its multi-leveled-interpretable lyrics to the death. i don’t think there’s anything remotely transphobic about it. art explores complex feelings &amp; confusions about our human experience like nothing else can. we shouldn’t censor those explorations. https://t.co/8ouAQ1Qj7k
you. have. no. idea. i hope you’re gonna see the show. you will not be disappointed. https://t.co/2TN8IFUzyn
@revsean i feel you and i know it’s true. just like all the general sexism and other bullshit i’ve absorbed and need to learn how to unpick...it’s a life-long de/reprogramming.
the accusations are true insofar as i’ve been truly accused of being transphobic by people who don’t know me very well. i think trans people are amazing. and brave. and beautiful. and deserving of the happiness, freedom &amp; acceptance that is the birthright of every human on earth. https://t.co/nOq6T0pwjk
@Zusehrverkuerzt @Annegret @MusicHistoryLaw 🤘🎨
@Prettiest_Star @sangerkatz @clairecm telling the story is the glue that’s gonna fix the universe. i’m telling mine as well. 🤘♥️
this is a great piece; painfully true. poetically, the same underrepresentation in music journalism has also fed the fire....and even when female/feminist journalists cover women, they’re often still towing the ol’ party lines in disguise. it’s nice to see that finally shifting🤘 https://t.co/ijLzlOn4wz

@timm I KNOW. he's all soul and generosity of feeling lately.
i can't tell why i need to ask this, but...whats like a wolf, like, an animal that has all the properties and metaphoric attributes of a wolf, but isn't a wolf?
i just re-read the email and realized i lied. nick cave said the cover was "awesome", not "amazing". i am going to hell, but hell is very nick-cave-esque so it's ok ?
aw thank you.  just wish it were possible to do the entire theater tour naked without being distracting. but even *i* can't watch someone with boobs playing the piano for three hours and not spend like two hours of it thinking...."hee hee. boobs". https://t.co/VKOgtdp64G
@YourCanadianGF funnily enough...the very first time i wrote to @nickcave (the musician) was back in 2009 or so, when i found out i was ON A BILL WITH HIM at a museum fundraiser. and i was like YAY can we do something together &amp; he wrote back, very kindly, telling me i'd got The Wrong Nick Cave.

@BBlues70 we have two and we are collecting more of you know any
@swheatcroft thank you. it’s a photograph by @allanamato taken on the side of the salton sea near LA, and the story behind it is pretty wonderful...i write about it in the photo/artbook that comes out alongside the record. x
@Zoftwarz @vnbateman is that like exercising your narcissism? or EXORCISING? i spend all day every day trying to exorcise my narcissism away. thanks for the motivational push. xxx
@SighVeaney i spent a lot of my mornings, before heading into the studio, listening to “skeleton tree”...i made that my personal bar to reach every day. that level of honesty in singing and playing and delivering. there’s a lot of nick infused in this record.
p.s. said cover. out march 8th. it’s the most personal collection of songs i’ve ever recorded. the double-vinyl and cd preorder are still running at https://t.co/L7tR8GdgTw https://t.co/8MqYJU83eY
i just got an email from nick cave saying he thinks my album cover is amazing so that’s my day fully made
i’ve been grumbling a lot lately about how twitter has devolved, and then i see moments like this. i post a song, people cry, then someone posts something about being unable to cry in general, and a rape survivor holds their hand and leads them through. twitter is still amazing. https://t.co/Zdbhg9aUWE
im gonna say it a lot this year, but john congleton, who produced &amp; engineered this record, didn’t just “produce &amp; engineeer” this record. he created a harbor for me. he sat in a control room while i wept during take after take &amp; made it all okay. he’s my friend &amp; my brother.🎹♥️ https://t.co/uik7MHftFX

@billhicksdotcom oh steve ITS YOU!!! sorry about that. :)
@peter_gillet i love you peter.
@SplendidRodent @JohnDrakeCooper then i recommend crying alone, witness-free. cry for you, for your grief, for your own release...not for an audience. it can feel pretty amazing to just let go like that. use whatever you need to get there. a movie, a song...a photo, a thought....just remember that it’s all ok.
@SplendidRodent @thecarie is there any shame involved? like...was crying a thing you were ever ashamed of when you were little? that baggage can hang around to haunt you.
i think...don’t worry. and don’t have crying performance anxiety. songs can make you feel all sorts of things. if it makes you feel like crying, it can be fun to cry. but fuck it. it’s your experience. just...listen. https://t.co/2Tm1d1adJO

@billhicksdotcom aw THANK YOU. side story: steve hicks, bill’s wonderful brother, granted me permission to use “the ride” monologue quote in the artbook that goes along with this album. a huge honor. his spirit lives on...and on. he’s still here, in a way, on the ride, with all of us. 🎡♥️
the extra magic credit belongs to @congletonjohn, who produced and engineered, and @MaxHenryMusic, who added all those subtle but glorious overdubs. male allies in the studio, lifting this women to heights unknown. 🎡 https://t.co/ll0vjCAtCR

@nprobin @NPR that makes me so happy. wrecking people that way is the point of this whole album. wait til you hear the rest of it. this song is only like a 7 on the scale from 1-10 with 1 being meh and 10 being full-throated weeping

@AnonR2 @ajunay1314 @astro_hsd @vnbateman @BarkHIll3 @eucopresident @BBCr4today is that why all men shave their public hair?
@KnaveYT @astro_hsd @BarkHIll3 @vnbateman @eucopresident @BBCr4today a real woman does literally whatever she has to do to make her voice heard in dire times.
@astro_hsd @BarkHIll3 @vnbateman @eucopresident @BBCr4today that is awesome. i’m glad her stunt worked - it was brave and smart. x
@AnjaSoulrocker @astro_hsd @vnbateman @BarkHIll3 @eucopresident @BBCr4today i don’t think what she was doing was supposed to be seen as feminism.
@seangreeneLUFC @BarkHIll3 @vnbateman @eucopresident i love you x
it’s a damn good day for @Medium
@basherWA76 i know. so dumb.
anyway...can you imagine the guts it took for her to do that...in an ACADEMIC context? it’s hard enough writing and memorizing a speech. but then to be naked in front of your peers like that? that’s some serious bravery, no matter your politics.
and meanwhile...i just read the comments on her original thread. jesus christ. you’d think that a whole internet of grown men had literally never encountered a normal patch of public hair on a woman before. oh wait...maybe they haven’t.
@BarkHIll3 @vnbateman @eucopresident ah, but it worked didn’t it. 913k views and counting, and people are listening to her talk. so call her crazy if you want, but she’s far from it.

@Rhapsody032590 @thelindsayellis @CHAPOTRAPHOUSE @PhillyD @ContraPoints @cgpgrey what we really need here is @imogenheap’s conceptual brainpower and a magical non-profit @blockchain company run by a collective of socialist art weirdos.
see last tweet. https://t.co/8nvPBcNiJs
dear ol’ rapey men. have you noticed? every disenfranchised group of people in this vast land are collectivizing. they all seem to have the same message to deliver: it’s time to toss the concept that america exists to please You &amp; Only You. it’s gonna be hard. let change come. ♥️
@thelindsayellis @CHAPOTRAPHOUSE @PhillyD @ContraPoints @cgpgrey illl bring wine. who’s bringing hummus?

@redgoldrush i'll let you imagine what the fuck that was. it's so weird i'm gonna leave it.
artists evolve, and so do you. if you connect with an artist at age 30 the way you did at 15, it's like....a miracle. part of being in this artist/audience relationship is understanding that. we cross paths when we are meant to, when we need each other. it's art, not marriage. x https://t.co/8nrxS9grTL

@MotherOfMittenz @neilhimself @Infernalle it was literally called mosaic. i worked with and loved them.
@debbiemillman or Wesanta. or something better. SwapShop. Circulator. NeedHaveGive. or there’s got to be a perfect exchange expression from some amazing cultures.
@MotherOfMittenz @neilhimself @Infernalle someday the internet will give us a way to do this more easily. there was an amazing want/have system developed by australians that i used so people could ask for and gift “the art of asking” book, but they closed down. calling a nerds.
just surfaced...taken @GlastoFest 2013, moments before this fateful bra pulled a janet jackson &amp; led to the penning &amp; full-nude delivery of “dear daily mail” two days later. dear daily mail, up yours. (also, look! an insta fan page! i’m famous!) the song: https://t.co/yPbBJpxlmV https://t.co/bktakrobDc
hey, that worked ! thanks internet. and now...@neilhimself, you really ought to set up a mosaic-like platform for have/want people who are willing to gift a masterclass. it’d be amazing. too bad mosaic itself went under. :( https://t.co/RNybx3GvZH
@neilhimself @Infernalle yeah. i see a foundation in the making. The Home For Little Wanderers Who Need Neil Gaiman’s Masterclass. No Writer Left Behind.
a literary award given to a refugee still trapped by the australian government...and he published the book by sending what’s app text messages, one by one. writers: you can and should do anything. @neilhimself (&amp; @PennyRed, who writes books on her phone). https://t.co/7sQVq7FI0a

@thedoodlefoxx neil in socks. not in socks. neil is lost when not in socks. amanda knows.  amanda rocks. she puts the extra  socks in box. neil is sad. look, neil is mad. he thinks his wife’s socks box is bad. amanda shakes her head and knows. those socks are bad. away they goes.
@sextonfleur @neilhimself you said “yes, dear” in an otherwise empty tweet. i think that means i won. or is this one of those awful british/american misunderstandings ?
i’m on a roll here after winning the socks battle. neil, you’re not allowed to tweet something like this and still have “will eventually grow up and get a real job” in your twitter bio. this is so legit grown up, just sayin https://t.co/OtUkGIoXEz
@neilhimself @realstdunstan @marksandspencer @michaelfranti MATCH POINT !!
@neilhimself @realstdunstan @marksandspencer @michaelfranti you haven’t seen how many socks there are. there are about this many and more. stop doubting your wife.
@neilhimself @jherekbischoff @Miriam_Curzon but you have so many.
and....yeah: I just backed Midtown Social: Fantastic Colors the Album on @Kickstarter https://t.co/JBjTXlz1Kz

until i got to track 6 and the synths and drum machine kicked in and then i was like OOOOH NO THE BAD 80s....I DO NOT MISS THIS SOUND
i have to tell you something. the socks led to this joke, but then i decided to crank up the phantom of the opera ('87 cast recording) soundtrack, which i know by heart but haven't listened to in 20 years, and now i'm on the verge of tears. no, wait i'm weeping. WHAT IS HAPPENING https://t.co/hUKUCxJSJs

@m_d_kerr @neilhimself gotta copy @jherekbischoff in here. (the other sock fetishist in my friend circle.)
@oz_penguin @neilhimself maybe we can frighten away the ghost of so many years ago with....MORE FUCKING SOCKS
@Aikidojo7 @neilhimself 👏👏👏
@neilhimself @realstdunstan @marksandspencer @michaelfranti yes. someday, we will learn how to manage the wild and untamed nature of this post-marital socks situation. but for now, let me turn them into hand puppet. do not deny the joy of socks.
@indyfromspace @neilhimself @realstdunstan @marksandspencer every sock puppet will come with its own electric toothbrush.
@neilhimself @realstdunstan @marksandspencer @michaelfranti and don’t make me post pictures to the internet. i swear to god i’ll do it if you push me too far
@neilhimself @realstdunstan @marksandspencer neil, sorry, but no. these are the EXTRA SOCKS. THAT ARE IN THE TUB IN THE BASEMENT THAT WILL NOT FIT IN THE DRAWER WITH THE 70+ PAIRS OF SOCKS ALREADY IN PLAY. do not dramatize this situation.  you will not walk sockless through the world. unless you want to be @michaelfranti.
@realstdunstan @neilhimself @marksandspencer i'm a musician not a mathematician. i meant 1,870 socks, obviously.

@ashleymloftin @neilhimself that’s a good story. x
@neilhimself when i have spare time, which will probably never happen, i plan to sew little puppet eyes and wigs onto all 187 of your extra/excessive black british @marksandspencer socks and sell them at an egregious price for charity. at $100 per sock-puppet, that’s $187,000 for the UNHCR.
@Miriam_Curzon @neilhimself i’ve considered doing that wirh his socks. there are (literally) hundreds. literally.
@smoknbobjd @neilhimself let’s not get into the chargers. there are more chargers than teethbrushes.
@dustyshockley @neilhimself a bristle of brushes.
@neilhimself on so inexaggerated SLIGHTLY. there are four. and you have one with you which makes five. but one is mine so four. but still. four. i mean...FOUR. SONICARE. TEETHBRUSH.

as i look sadly back &amp; forth between the news, the #MuellerInvestigation and my 3-yr-old son, who knows nothing about politics, i am suddenly filled with a joyous optimism: maybe this entire generation will grow up believing that it is absolutely crucial to always tell the truth.
@lord_of_ravioli what? which city/show?
the audiobook or the book book? either way...i’m so glad i made you cry. in the good way. pass it forward. x https://t.co/9zDG5aQIAV
“Trump has spent...his personal life surrounding himself with a particular type of woman: young, working hard at being attractive to men &amp; compliant. He filters the women in his professional life through this same lens, demanding unyielding female loyalty &amp; prizing female beauty”
https://t.co/9SWvCFiUFn
“While Trump has snaked and slithered his way in and out of scandal, corruption &amp; self-dealing his entire life, there’s one force that seems to truly destabilize him: a competent woman. Which is why, in the Trump era, there’s no better speaker of the House than Nancy Pelosi.”...

dear TORONTO, please RT for locals! i am coming back to you again and i am so, so happy. i'll be bringing my "THERE WILL BE NO INTERMISSION" solo piano stage show to you on march 22nd @ the queen elizabeth theatre. tickets are moving fast. get em here: https://t.co/2ACWEfUZKs https://t.co/UphmC48eEz

@chadwsugg thank you!!! i almost just had a heart attack.
@samislaughing YES!!!!!! SOLVED !! thank you
@tericee nope....
@traderscrucible nothing happens.
@tericee there is NO stop icon, or done button ! that's the weird thing. it's only giving me the choice to resume or pause.
this is a very specific nerdy question, but a 38-minute un-recreatable piece of voice-memo recording is currently at stake. the voice memo app on the iphone 7 is driving me nuts. it's toggling between two options: resume or pause. there's no stop/save/done. what am i missing? https://t.co/L8dGrWPZce

@girlvsplanet @therealbobbear @neilhimself i like sharing the “real” (read: unglamorous) parts of my life more than the so-called glamorous ones. sharing the real means my love and conversation with my community is built on actual-reality, not some superficial performance of myself. 🚀
in these confusing, divided, flailing times: a reminder from one of america’s greatest leaders that radical compassion - for all, for ALL - is always, always, always the way forward. love and compassion must not be selective. everybody means goddamn everybody. 🙏🏼#MLKDay2019 https://t.co/Fh1tMCbtA9

@jarredjennings HOW
OLD LESBIANS ORGANIZING FOR CHANGE. YES. #womensmarch https://t.co/E7k7lu4xBd
whatever way you look at it, all women are marching together today. marchin’ to grocery stores, marchin’ to jobs...some of us, who can, with signs &amp; banners. infighting happens, but onward we march. as one. away from voicelessness. towards a future. let’s do it. #womensmarch
no matter what you are doing today - do SOMETHING. walk your goddamn feet, literally or figuratively, towards progress. support your local march, or call/email a rep about your local reproductive laws, or just walk around in public with “i will survive” on your phone full blast.
consensus is impossible. no two people will ever agree on a perfect feminism. know yer history. suffrage, civil rights...all filled with infighting and people getting left behind - or staying behind - as the march marched on. we shouldn’t expect this to be easy or simple.
since i’ve been buried under an album release and taking care of a three year old with no co-parent around, i’m only just catching up on the fracturing surrounding the #womensmarch as i go to march today in my own small town. aie aie aie. it’s sad but it’s not surprising. listen:

@vjerkov everybody’s gotta start somewhere. x
@DevinHiggins it’s tough for all of us. keep fighting the good fight. 🏆
@frankychukz i totally agree with you. there’s a ton of awfulness out there. in the media, in the whole world. but there’s also an awful lot of really good men &amp; women fighting for equality of all beings. we gotta not forget that. 🙏🏼
@frankychukz you’re hanging out with the wrong feminists. you gotta come over to my house. x
@StinkerBelle74 it’s good to remind them. :)
@LovingAural in that way, we are all struggling. sometimes everything can feel so insignificant. but my point is that...it isn’t. seeing all the men coming out of the woodwork lately is really inspiring. sometimes a mass of small actions feels like the most hopeful path to lasting progress.
@elcheshen i’m tryin 🎡
a note to all men who may read this. if you’re helping the feminist cause in any way on here...by RTing, by commenting, by shining lights on important subjects, by not passively sitting back and letting others do the work: thank you. we see &amp; appreciate it. and it’s so important.

@dirkhaun I AM A BUSY WOMAN
haha. terrible auto-typo there. that’s “frida khalo”. though...im@gonna leave it. because i believe a frida khaki meme might be in order.
welcome !! thank you for coming along. 💙 https://t.co/NsSmQbIffR
this community we have built is incredible - each according to their need. i am taking none of this for granted. i am an incredibly blessed artist, indeed. P.S. thanks to @JustineMarzack who helped me negotiate La Poste, and helped lick stamps over coffee 🙏🏼♥. all together now.
along with all my other patrons, they’ve made it possible for me to follow my own, shameless artistic path with no orders from fucking anybody: no museum, no art dealers, no major label, no man. patrons come &amp; go according to their ability.
my postcard-tier patrons -30+ of them - have been responsible for covering somewhere in the ballpark of $100,000 worth of costs for life+artwork over the last three and a half years.... so that i can work  fearlessly, with no commercial regard for anything. https://t.co/NRtozXe6Nb
instead, i bought 35 headless fridas &amp; am sending them worldwide to my postcard-tier patrons. i’d love to know how frida &amp; diego dealt with finances/survival as artists - the dough always has to come from somewhere. paint costs money. https://t.co/zoSlBkm4Ue
there was not a single postcard of this corset artwork. maybe the gift shop thought it was too offensive. i wish they hadn’t. i would have bought 50 &amp; sent them to every woman i know who’s had an abortion or a miscarriage lately. https://t.co/AIaMLsN133
the exhibit gift shop was really fascinating. there were THOUSANDS of items, including outfits, copies of the communist manifesto, puzzles and socks. and a particularly offensive paper doll set, showing friday with a perfectly shaped barbie-looking legs. but... https://t.co/NA3sRnU1dD
THIS IS WHY. this is why frida kahlo, now. when you see her likeness, know this. women need icons who lit the path out of the dark &amp; showed us creative ways out of shame, and pain. i stood there in front of that corset, a year after my own miscarriage, weeping grateful tears. https://t.co/NQonyBgGYv
her life was mostly bed-ridden. drugs, corsets, 20+  surgeries. she painted her way through, often in her bed. i hadn’t known that she’d also had several medically necessary abortions and an emotionally searing miscarriage. the corset you see here depicts her miscarried fetus. https://t.co/JNWe9q0udg
i was overcome with recognition: an artist plundering her own pain and predicament to make relentlessly honest, therapeutic art. after being born with polio and a short leg, frida was in a bus accident as a teen, impaled by a pole that cut through her spine, vagina and pelvis. https://t.co/fDbALx5vBJ
{thread} march of the headless frida kahlos. she’s surging in popularity, competing w/ che-in-beret for “replicated on the most unlikely merchandise”. why now? i didn’t fully understand until i went to the “frida khaki: making herself up” exhibit @V_and_A museum in london... https://t.co/1Mcsqa6jMY
@moorehn ...what if it’s MUSIC?? if so, i am fully fucked when my new solo record comes out this spring. i go there hard. but “songwriting” is lauded somewhere above “mommy blogging” (and poetry, sadly). even if we are all saying the same shit.
@moorehn fascinating thread, having just finished a didion book....where we are slotting “mommy blogging” versus “literature kinda shit”. what if it’s poetry? what if its fiction(alized) but terribly mean and obvious to the child, vs blunt memoir framed compassionately?...
@ItsMeHenning i was about to say david bowie, which is true, or bono, or jon bon jovi....but while i was thinking about all of them and who was more famous, i realized i’ve recently met bette midler and was like yeah...she wins.

this last bag (a “nyssa” from eastern mtn sports) had four pockets with zips that opened so broadly that things were often lost in transit. bad bad bad. CAN YOU SEND ME INTRODUCTIONS TO BACKPACKS WITH WHOM I MAY BUILD A LASTING RELATIONSHIP. thanks all.
i am determined to find the right relationship. big enough for laptop, folders, change of clothes; small enough to fit under plane seat. MANY POCKETS. i use one pocket for toiletries, cos you never know. built to last, no bullshit: i do not need a built-in x-desert hydration belt
i have a question. when you travel for a living, the right backpack is almost more important than your choice in life partner. i’m about to say goodbye to this one after 7 years. we had a rough run...i never loved it like i loved the one that lived with me 2003-2011 (RIP). now... https://t.co/T2H75pupUX

@Michell69266563 prying him away after the refrains of “I WANT TO PLAY THE FLUTE MAMA” got increasingly more violent. :)
in a dime store in the deep carribean today, ash (who is 3) saw a toy machine gun. he said: “i want it”. i said: “what is it?” he didn’t know. i said: “which instrument is it, ash?” he thought &amp; said: “a flute.” then: “can i play it, mama?” i closed my eyes, willing time to stop.
@SeanFrancis it felt like “kids” except way less bleak.

to @neilhimself: wherever you are now, whether we are flying solo, in tandem, or merged...i’ve got your back.   happy anniversary, my love.  and to all y’all trying to keep steady on the winds of long-distance relationships...keep the faith. anything’s possible with enough love.
the day after, we flew separate directions &amp; didn’t see each other for ages. in many ways, little has changed. we run on a certain kind of faith that, eventually, we will alight on the same branch. eight years later, with a child, we are still in a long-distance relationship.
this is our first anniversary apart from one another. we miss each other. we didn’t know what we were doing then, and we don’t know what we are doing now. back then, we were trying to fit a real relationship into the cracks of what was most important to us...our work.
{thread} 8 years ago today, we got married in ayelet &amp; michael‘s living room.  there was no photograher, no cake (but ayelet ordered some really delicious pies), no band (but there was an accordion around somewhere), no invitations, no decorations, no dramas. but there was love. https://t.co/j0evwiSYah

@MsMarialba bernie seems healthy af. like, healthier than trump. look at RBG. i think bernie’s got at least a good 10 years in him before he starts to fade out.
i’m curious to see where everybody stands in terms of excitement re: presidential candidates running against trump in 2020. bernie? warren? beto? biden? harris? there are so many possibilities....who are you gunning for? or are you waiting/ambivalent? tell me everything, please.

@youngb3 @Kleenex thank you !! let me check how long i’ve been weeping about the fucking system by checking my @Cartier watch
@wavyknife 😐
@tiffaniangus @JRThurner this has been my career for 15 years. long live the non-brandable artist.
@daviocious i’m not a brand ambassador of patreon unless they offer to stop taking their 5% fee in exchange for me pimping their product. i’m like any other artist there. we need to distinguish between what i talk about because i use it &amp; what i talk about because i’m paid to talk about it.
@daviocious absolutely. i always have to navigate this with class. and as happy as i am taking gifts &amp; thanking people (when and if i feel like it), i think the most important thing for an artist is to be unencumbered by the expectations and needs of others. including audiences. and brands.
@doryowen @socialsiege thank you for sharing. this is good.
@rabbitholer maybe we should all agree to say something on the way out. like "i miss you just being a person and all the ads are bugging me." but it can be hard to say that. it's all hard.
@AKAsusangreen @socialsiege it's just weird when the lines are blurred between what is life and what is ad.
@JRThurner the end product of capitalism. we have become the product.
@River_Vox compassionately.
@JRhodesPianist hey james, thanks! i’m so totally psyched to be reading your tweet while lying on the couch wearing my rad new @SpaceX-brand SUPER SOFT @astronautpajamas and popping @valium and @othercoolsedatives !!
@TabethaWatching what’s weirder is talking to younger artists who get mad at me for “shaming” artists who have become professional product-hockers. i don’t want to shame anybody. but i don’t want the art and music world to turn into a inauthentic capitalist-apocalypse either. it’s a hard one.
@BCHezza how’s that mame you feel ? i’m genuinely curious about this kind of stuff.
@GloriaChapa1 my general question is about the hidden costs of all of this. what is it doing to our ability to trust one another online if everyone is becoming a paid brand ambassador?
@River_Vox the thing that bugs me out isn’t the ubiquity of hocking. it’s the fact that people aren’t fighting back. everyone is so protective of everybody else’s vulnerability; it seems really unkind uncouth to be like: WHAT ARE YOU DOING GOD NO. but seriously, WHAT ARE YOU DOING GOD NO
@socialsiege this. i’m not upset with my friends. i’m upset with the system. i was brought up to believe that hocking product using your art channel was selling out. and i remember a time when social media was used for communication and community, not buying and selling. i feel old &amp; bitter.
@KeonHimself i’m sure it is. but it’s making this old punk really fucking grumpy.
@reubenparks 😭
@tonymeade there’s gotta be a better way.
@LukeRobertMason @brokep 🤘
everywhere i look all these people i know on social media are posting photos for “brands” and “products”. i am trying not to judge. but my stomach is sinking. is it just me? or is the product placement especially egregiously bad right now? is this what everything has come to?

y’know, just a little light reading for the bus or the subway. NO - that will not happen. this book is 12 inches by 12 inches and is mostly meant for shelves and coffee tables. coffee tables that are into death.

well, friends, i did it. i wrote 7,000 words today, sent them to my editor, this artbook is gonna have some damn fine stories in it. it’s all over he place. but then again, so am i, and so is this album. patrons only can order the hardback. softcover to the public in the new year
it took me a second as well. but now i’m in love. And the demo feels LACKING https://t.co/nhzDeR1Bez

@guiltymuse i can’t tell you anything about 2003-2012. i just say “i was somewhere....on tour”.
@Fatalani i feel that. i erased the due date of my miscarried pregnancy, but the date i actually miscarried is pretty hard to unlodge from my brain (it was fucking christmas). i’m about to have my one year miscarriage-versary!! HAPPY CHRISTMISCARRIAGE.
memoir writing + google = weird. every time i have to remember when that abortion was, i google the month &amp; year i spoke at canadian music week. i've now googled it 3 times in the course of writing this book. you'd think these dates would stick. maybe they don't...for a reason.
yeah https://t.co/L3hrQoUu3h

i’m on deadline now,...still putting the finishing touches on the text for the artbook that’s going to house all of these photos. i’m learning a lot, through the writing, about how therapeutic this whole album has been..the writing, the recording, photoshoots, the collaborating. https://t.co/Z5k1FO0kpN
recently, i’ve watched so many women separate; driven from one another by competition, comparison, scarcity. but also, i’ve watched the reaction: vines growing deeper &amp; higher as we communicate more deeply about the real shit we've experienced. sharing the truth is unwinding us. https://t.co/n1OcxpjJmp
the same thing happened when i started discussing abortion more openly: so many women in my life drew closer to me in those moments, as if we were part of an underground railroad of information. those who came closer to me were deeply held. the tables were often turned quickly. https://t.co/0sHnDIE65r

that was the idea. but also made it hard to choose this one as the album cover in a digital age. vinyl - YES. poster - YES. but everything is always so tiny on the net. i wanted something that would slice through the screen. thus the nekkid shot as cover. https://t.co/M8gFUdwJWn
to the almost 25k people who supported "theatre is evil" on kickstarter (remember that?) i just posted a LONG update for y'all. it should have emailed to you,,,,but emails change, and that was 2012. read it here, it's public. https://t.co/0S7yPTkMP6

update: my eye is fine. the tree...i dunno. it’s complicated. we had a long discussion about it. we already killed it. but then it hurt me. befriend? fire? we decided to befriend it but give ash a lesson about our new “ouchy christmas cactus tree”. 🌲♥️🍷 https://t.co/LGkSp55CfS

Q: Do you ever feel an albums complete or does the perfectionist in you always feel you could change this or that? #AskNoIntermission - @nrmeadows  A: https://t.co/BcqTAAWcgk
I AM ON FIRE !!!! THANK YOU FOR ASKING. I LOVE YOU TOO. https://t.co/TocVZww8tu
LAST CALL !!! https://t.co/1vhEfVwahI
thank you. making this record was an unavoidable pleasure for me. https://t.co/XEUeEEPmZK
OOOH GOOD ONE. 1: “dilate” by @AniDifranco and 2: “skeleton tree” by @nickcave - which i listened to a lot while recording. it was my beacon. https://t.co/aMnQuq5KtK
nope. https://t.co/GVHssgu8bn
this album has a lot of punk cabaret in it. “look mummy no hands” is LITERALLY a cabaret song...and “machete” is punk af. so yeah. https://t.co/oReT9ugfR4
Q: #AskNoIntermission I’m going to my first AFP show when you come to STL, I’m also going by myself. I’m excited and anxious. What are your favorite things about your shows? - @saltshadowtarot  A: https://t.co/PgbDCso2nj
it feels like giving birth after being pregnant for a long time. without the labor pains; but with added fear of criticism. (i would have loved it if they’d come to review my birth. (@pitchfork would have given it an 8.2....really great but minus 1.8 points for “trying too hard”) https://t.co/nQvOPkEbzU
actually, two of the songs on this album were crowd-sources through my blog on patreon: “drowning in the sound” and “the ride”. everybody helped. x https://t.co/reCFZ1tSdx
Q: @amandapalmer What are you most proud of in the creation of this album? #AskNoIntermission - @vvyris  A: https://t.co/mLAI7KTiCw
hahaha we are working very hard at taking care of a marriage and a goddamn toddler. that’s enough for right now. 😬 https://t.co/AeQUU5veeQ
this tour is going to be my VERY FIRST global tour with just an acoustic piano. (and a little ukulele). it’s just me, on stage, in giant theaters, playing songs and talking. it’s going to be really powerful. i’m excited. https://t.co/3vvcKhgCQ7
UK/europe dates will be announced in february. https://t.co/AXsf48RNCV
YES. I FUCKING AM. THIS BABY LIT A FIRE UNDER MY ASS TO BE AN UNAPOLOGETIC ART MOTHERFUCKER MOTHER. i was worried that i would die an art death when i became a mother. instead, i became fearless. https://t.co/GyQJq5J4vy
i’m sure those will find their moments. they didn’t fit on this album, if you know what i mean. they could be future @dresdendolls songs 😱 https://t.co/QlIGquxRZ7
very probably. xxx https://t.co/rKAdaVSNOo
prouder than anything i’ve ever done. including the last book. and like i’m fully liberated from a lot of things. https://t.co/FBuMlO0YRq
hahaha. just @jasonwebley on one song. it’s perfect. i wrote that song on his houseboat and he recorded the demo there as well. full circle. 🎡 https://t.co/JaGDow96Ln
this record is the deepest and direct i’ve ever written. so if you’ve been moved in the past, this one is like mainlining. it’s just one gut-punching song after another. i wrote them to survive the last 6 years, so i assume they will resonate with others trying to survive. https://t.co/aWN2jA9M1B
Q: #AskNoIntermission i noticed some of the tracks are named with parts of another songs so is it something like melodrama with liability or like bsides that made into the a side - @deweydenouement  A: https://t.co/VyUFi6cTSX
this is a theater show. it’s a sit down and listen show. there was no way i was gonna make people stand through this kind of experience. also, many of the songs are quiet. so all that. https://t.co/6mlJtGsxSQ
Q: @amandapalmer Did you know that you'll be in Denver on Comic Con weekend? I feel like that's a sign! I'm not sure what it means... but it seems like a harbinger of fabulous things to come ... #asknointermission - @minidawn  A: https://t.co/g1WF9BRCAP
loss. grief. motherhood. influences. fear. abortion. cancer. miscarriage. IT’S A LAUGH A MINUTE, I TELL YOU. GUT-BUSTING. https://t.co/gzoDoGHQ0h
Q: #AskNoIntermission I'm always curious about song sequencing on an album. what helped guide the decision making for order of songs on "No Intermission" thx - @Aimsel  A: https://t.co/hVTL9zF6ZX
oooh thank you for the heads up!!! i’ll bring my cape. https://t.co/hdR93tWwAH

WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR THE PRODUCTION ON THE SONG YOU WILL DIE https://t.co/QalWoSbJcw
i’m taking off july and august to collapse with @neilhimself and our three-year-old, ash. :) then i hit europe and the UK and australia. those dates will get announced later .... https://t.co/FPXWVKFcVC
Q: Why did you choose a nude photo for the album cover?#AskNoIntermission - @jtmarie67  A: https://t.co/99ZVhhkBf7
yes. that song was probably “the ride” or “death thing” - both of which made it onto the album. (and are awesome.) https://t.co/xCHeMKWtuB
FIVE. HANKY. RECORD. https://t.co/u2dlBG9bvn

@CrowSongLodge here’s a pile of cred: ⛰
@jocastarora i’ve barely shaved since 17 i STILL get self-conscious. it’s all still fueled by the constant micro-judgments of others. it’s not just about overcoming that self-consciousness, it’s about living in the discomfort &amp; finding an identity there. of bravery in the face of all that.
you’re so welcome. and i love you and any leg hair you chose to have or not have. FREEDOM FOR ALL EVERYWHERE FOREVER. xx https://t.co/cMxSJG1les
this is the most beautiful, articulate piece of writing i have ever read about patronage and what is actually is and means. my head almost fell off from nodding. thank you for sending it, i’ll share it widely. xx https://t.co/BpS1h19rBO
it is not weird. every woman i know wants some part of her body to be more this or less that, that is the way we are taught to think: to find ourselves flawed or lacking. we revere comparison like a varsity sport and it destroys us. fuck em all. i love your leg hair. the end. ♥️ https://t.co/JLMggFlHta

@Samantha12Jane @neilhimself that’s actually our plan for 2019. damn woman needs to get back in the kitchen and earn his keep.
@vampandora classic bullshit.
it’s worth pointing out that never, not once, has @neilhimself received a tweet suggesting he shouldn’t charge for books because his wife’s career is going well. think about it. and here’s the link to my patreon. help me pay for art &amp; support my husband! https://t.co/StKQnUYJqk
@catzpuccino exactly.
how much money my partner makes has absolutely zero to do it. it’s 2018. i don’t see anyone saying to Beyoncé: “why are you selling your music on itunes when your husband has plenty of money?” it’s silly, slightly sexist, and generally disrespectful towards what we do as artists. https://t.co/f8lOHQB175

@MischiefSacred AMEN 🍷
@kayleighathena and i love you. thank you. 🔥
to my patrons (i know many of you are reading this), thank you all for getting it, and for your years of support. if you’re not a patron and want to join this circus, i encourage you. it’s only getting better and weirder every day. the end, i love you all. https://t.co/StKQnUYJqk
i got so much grief in 2012 for using kickstarter &amp; i hope, deeply, that the world has woken up &amp; understands a little more about crowdfunding, how it works, and WHY it works for so many artists and their supporters. if you have questions, ask. if you still don’t get it... 💁🏻‍♀️
this relationship i have with my 12,000 patrons is actual, hardcore, old-school patronage. these people want to see my art in the world &amp; they’re willing to throw down to make sure it happens, however messy the process. it’s an agreement between consenting adults. everybody wins.
my choice to build a community on patreon for the last 3 years has meant, for the first time in my career i’ve been able to draw a stead salary, pay my staff &amp; office costs with no drama, and most important: make non-commercial art with no “market value” without LOSING money.
my patrons support me so that i can spend more time making music &amp; art, and less time stressing about how to “sell” that art. it isn’t a fan club, and it isn’t charity. charity implies that there’s a pity component - and that i’m not giving these folks anything for their support.
i believe that they support me, at an average of about $3/month, so that i DON’T have to think desperately about how to market and hock my work, so that i never have to take a soul-crushing corporate endorsement to pay my bills, so that i can keep ads off my damn youtube channel.
the truth is: artists don’t want to think that way. audiences don’t either. i have 12,000 patrons right now, and i have a feeling that the reason 99% support me isn’t to get the blogs and merch deals and exclusive content...even though i do all that shit as a sign of gratitude.
art is - and always has been - about a deeper human connection than just a buy-sell-supply-demand. it’s hard for us to remember this at times, because the industry RELIES on everybody to think of art, music, and even EXPERIENCE as a commodity; a thing you can stick a price on.
when i turned to crowdfunding, i sae that despite the fact that NONE of the powers that be  “approved” - not the labels, not the media - the direct line i had to my community was the most powerful tool i had, and that art is about so more than just money, “content” and “product”.
my entire career, like so many artists i know, was a cycle of confusing feast of famine for many years. giant advances, unexpected costs, lying record labels, sudden windfalls, sudden catastrophes. i thought that this was just “how it was” if you were a musician, and suck it.
{thread) i’m dropping a new album &amp; tour announcement in a few days - my first big one in six years (since my kickstarter record “theatre is evil” in 2012). for anyone about to give me grief about using patreon for any reason, let me explain so we can get this over with, okay?
you’re welcome. my new record is going to drown you in an ocean of your own tears. it makes theatre is evil feel like a happy holiday record. it’s so goddamn tear-producing. https://t.co/jHXAN1ITab

i try to explain it to people using a public radio metaphor; better than a tip jar. i never feel like i’m “tipping” @NPR, i feel like i’m giving them my $100 bucks a year so they can just always exist and be awesome. it’s actual, old-school patronage. https://t.co/FSQrh0A3Qw

i gotta say - i am loving watching the universal embrace of patreon. i spent three years having to explain kickstarter to people. now i don’t need to anymore. and it feels like 2011 again: i’m having to explain patreon over and over and over. but soon everyone will just get it. https://t.co/okVH27sgB5

i love this. the germans don’t really have a perfect word for “shitstorm” so merkel just borrowed the original english. i suppose “Scheißsturm” doesn’t have the same ring.  #ScheißSturmUndDrang  https://t.co/MvaMosCYTy
@BonDenbo i am incapable of drinking a drink slowly. i am basically my three year old. WANT.

@AnorakParka DAMN RIGHT. 9,007.
@atlveg stay tuned.
@maureenjohnson started at 10:30, wrote til 4:30, did a call from 5-6, put the kid to bed, wrote from 7-11pm. killin it. didn’t eat well, and didn’t answer any fucking emails. and didn’t work on my show run-through for tomorrow. whatever.
i was on wine 2 by words 7-8,000, im pretty sure they’re the best. wine 3 by the last 1,500 words. i’m pretty sure they’re the worst.  PACING 🍷🍷 https://t.co/PY4M6XEBuM
amazing interview with @Marisha_Ray...so many resonances with her street performing hustle stories at about 1:05. 🤘♥️ https://t.co/oai3ynpUTm

i'm not sure. this wasn't an issue until last night, but now i'm really curious to find out why. https://t.co/O1zMComljP
eh - thats arguable. it's coming from all sides. https://t.co/WWPWDELNVw
NYC! dec 30th. must-see; one of my all-time heroes, Baby Dee, the gender–dysphoric medievalist songwriter is ending touring. say goodbye &amp; hear her sing about predestination, elevator guys, manic depressive snowmen &amp;disgruntled reindeer... https://t.co/ZYluSrzP1k
listening to a story on @NPR about “rape kit destruction”. even the term itself - a kind of layered impossible poetry with no center - seems to encompass everything that’s wrong with the world.
@danirat the irony is that “freedom” is starting to mean such different things to different people. we are all painting ourselves into our own strange corners. it’s dismal.
@__roxor this was part of why it was so funny. the fact that it came from new york and not salt lake city...go figure.
and for my final act, ladies and gentleman, they won’t be able to do much about the nudity at the merch table. my album art and the posters are full fucking frontal. 😊
i’ve asked every theater on my upcoming tour in north america to please allow my touring party to post all-gender signs on all venue bathrooms. we’ll see if that goes down like a lead balloon, but maybe they’re ready to join the future. The Change is coming.
anyway, discuss here. i didn’t want to shut down the conversation. and also, to my promoters, sorry for giving you aneurisms. also, one thing i wanted to include:
someone’s gotta say something, and i don’t mind being the one to say it. i don’t want my country sliding backwards into hell. too many women and performers and sex workers have fought too hard for progress for me to just say “oh well no tits too bad”. that’s why i posted it.
as a feminist, and as a performer, it makes me happy that i can post emails like that and spark a discussion about nudity, about freedom, and about how shocking it is that in NYC - of all places - i would get an email like that from a venue.
however, i wrote back to my tour team and told them that, all joking aside, this topic is actually pretty important to me. given what’s been going on with tumblr and the crack-down on nudity on the web, i feel like the country is headed into a puritan dystopia.
i’m not in the habit of deleting tweets, especially when it means that all the traffic beneath loses its context. i got some immediate emails from my promoters, who got scared. and i admit its not the most professional move to post an email, even one as hilarious as that....
{thread} i just deleted a thread in which i’d posted a blacked-out-for-anonymity screenshotted email from my upcoming theater/venue in NYC; they’d seen “photos of me on-line” along with a “friendly reminder” about their no-nudity policy. i’d like to discuss. first of all...
@maureenjohnson cue dramatic, melancholy, orchestral music
@HeyEunjoo ✋
@brothrstrawbrry omg. i may ask all men to attend this show shirtless. or, come to think of it, all humans. they didn’t say ANYTHING about the AUDIENCE ....🤔
@autumn_leavitt but come now. they left out the most important part of my fucking name.
@maureenjohnson *throws on robe, rushes barefoot outside into cold night, realizes there are no directions to your house, chides self for wanting to show tits at any hour to any person, wanders back to twitter on the couch*
while i have you here...i’ve requested that every show in north america this spring allow me to hang all-gender signs on all venue bathrooms. i’m assuming it will go down like a lead balloon but who knows. maybe the theaters of the world are actually ready to join the future.
@allisoncc i mean, i could promote a naked signing outside the venue after the show. BUT YOU WOULD ALL HAVE TO BE NAKED and where would you put your stuff. wait. i’ve got it. clothing-totes at the merch table. i am feeling the beginning of a beautiful plan.
@SockeyeSah https://t.co/PYy3ScurrB
@lediva new york is not a giant seated theater with its own rules 😊
@Coene_Arts maybe i will have to ditch the whole sad-solo-piano bit...just prance around and sing popular karaoke songs in my rubber fake boob bra. *begins planning playlist*
p.s.  extra eye-roll for the clueless misspelling of “online”. i have a feeling this office communicates via fax.

SURPRISE i’ve been working on secret TV! the bizarrofun folks at @HappySYFY - based on the @grantmorrison comic - have invited me into their coven for a cameo. season 1 drops on @netflix dec. 6 &amp; season 2 (this) drops on @syfy in 2019. everyone on the set &amp; crew has been gold. 🙏🏼 https://t.co/Zu5bUkPUXL
@thorharris666 @StoodUpTooFast @dietcig listen to thor. but also, as one who had to tour for months at a time...i just didn’t (and @neilhimself still don’t) have pets. it’s a heartbreaking reality of road life. i’m 42 and hoping i can finally slow down enough to get a fucking cat. you gotta consider the critters.

...Garber says, "Harris's book manifests its cultural anxiety through a kind of baroque bravado of plot," and calls the book "a fable of gender dysphoria gone spectacularly awry".[4] https://t.co/SxMeHjbWhW
from wiki--- Marjorie Garber, author of "Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing and Cultural Anxiety", asserts that despite the book and the film indicating that Buffalo Bill merely believes himself to be transsexual, they still imply negative connotations about transsexualism....

ok, end of late-night silence of the lambs appreciation thread. i'm going to make some tea and go down a silence of the lambs google hole. talk to me. i love you all. **makes fava/chianti teeth-sucking noise and waves** {end thread}
..and there was not only a MOTH WRANGLER &amp; STYLIST (!) BUT AN *ASSISTANT* MOTHER WRANGLER &amp; STYLIST. that's how fucking good this film is. and my mind's still blown by finding out recently that Q Lazzarus, the singer of "goodbye horses" (the "would you fuck me" song), is female.
i love the language of this film, the endlessly detailed layers of visual symbolism. and in 2018, i'm struck w/ the way clarice starling is constantly objectified by the male gaze around her, how bill makes women into actual objects, how "object"-ification is such a huge theme...
AND GODDAMN SILENCE OF THE LAMBS IS STILL THE BEST MOVIE EVER. so interesting revisiting it in 2018...first: i really wonder what the trans community thought/thinks of it. also...no wonder i've always loved it when i don't even like horrors/thrillers...IT IS FEMINIST *AS FUCK*.
{thread} after 3 epic london @dresdendolls shows, which involved re-learning 20+ dolls songs, all after coming straight from LA &amp; memorizing 70+min of new songs for my 1st solo record in 6 yrs, i HAD to turn my brain off. so i watched silence of the lambs for like the 5th time...
the current working title of that new dolls song is "blaming the victim" and it's got no plans to be recorded right now....give us a sec, though. the @DresdenDolls are always full of surprises :) https://t.co/a25b0zF7AN

they can call us naive but making open and honest and visceral and satirical art is a huge part of how we are going to protest and fight this madness. it has always been true since the dawn of history. art fights and works. we fight with words and pens and songs. it’s time now. https://t.co/89o7lrNLD2
one of the #PittsburghSynagogueShooting victims, rose mallinger, was 97. that means born in 1921. that means she lived through the entire holocaust &amp; WWII. imagine surviving that, and seeing millions of jews slaughtered by nazis that long ago, only to be gunned down at 97. why.

ninety-six Americans die every single day in this country due to gun violence. yes: 96. that’s almost a hundred people a day. think of their faces, their daughters, sons, moms, dads. their histories. every person. then think about why we aren’t fighting harder for gun control.

...if i’d stayed in the system, the chances of my having a forced caesarian were 99%. women deserve so much more than this. i was lucky and privileged to be able to have to dough to take off work, escape and do it my way. that option should be open to every woman having a baby.
i also chose to get the hell out of western hospital land when they started giving me grief about being an “advanced age” pregnant lady. it was so patronizing. so i said fuck it &amp; hid out in progressive hippie land w/ The Farm midwives and had a totally safe, natural childbirth.

@geetadayal 😬
my patrons are my family. social media has changed so much. facebook and twitter aren't like they were ten years ago...there's so much noise &amp; filtration &amp; negative garbage. my patreon blog is a really beautiful place where the community can connect without that. end of pitch.
all of my patrons get access to behind-the-scenes art in workshop phase, access to a private blog to which i post constantly (probably too much, i am a firehose). and patrons also get early access to tour tickets and to merch and other stuff that the public doesn't. but mostly...
i am currently micro-funded by 12,000 patrons, the artistic equivalent of taking zero money from super PACS. no label, no compromise, no bullshit, no corporate tie-ins, just the art i believe in &amp; make with my friends. please join us so we can do more. https://t.co/StKQnUYJqk
@de_void nah - she wasn’t the host from hell. i have HAD the host from hell in sydney, australia :) she was actually really nice. that’s why it hurts. i feel like a disappointment. also: that joint held and comforted me while i recorded my album. it all feels wrong.
@laimelde I HAVE BEEN THERE.
@skalovingeek haha. i doubt it. the host was a sweetheart.
@geetadayal thanks! i didn’t think i was crazy. there was one real faux pas: there was sharpie on a sheet. i tried to bleach. apparently bleach no make sharpie go away. but other than that it was standard usage dust. okay and one of the candlesticks was singed. wait, maybe i am awful.
i thought i left that air bnb in pretty good shape. i got an email from the host saying she was appalled. is it truth or world view? either way i feel twelve and scolded and sad.

“mr. weinstein will see you now” was a song written in the character of a women in a hotel room with a weinstein/cosby/(fill in the blank) type with those exact voices doug battle in her head. those battles we have to listen to on volume 11 all our lives.
every woman i know deals with these daily micro-battles in her head to survive, mentally. culture and media, generally, doesn’t support us: it feeds the mental battle, constantly making our inner lives and mental heath - our fight to stay sane - a full-time fucking job.
should i sleep with this person? am i really attracted to them or am i just trying to get something? what if people think i’m sleeping with this person because i’m trying to get something? what is real? what if i just want a shag and a cuddle? who is going to judge my desires?
was it my fault? how much of it was my fault? how should i look today? what should i wear tomorrow? should i get my emails done or spend effort brushing my fucking hair so that i look acceptable enough to go to this meeting? why is this man getting angry at me for attracting him?
the battle that women have to in their own heads on a daily, minutes basis. sizing up situations, playing theatrical roles, protecting ourselves and our “reputations”. laughing at jokes that aren’t funny. making jokes that are funny just because we need tools to NOT. GO. CRAZY.
the date rape i experienced at 20. i woke up with someone i’d gone home with the night before having intercourse with me in my sleep. we hadn’t fucked the night before. i was too shocked to tell him to stop. the fact that it didn’t occur to me that what was happening was rape.
all the men i thought i had to seduce if i wanted to be liked &amp; heard. all the piano teachers i had as a teenager who wanted to fuck me instead of teach me. all the choices i made, blindly and carelessly, because i didn’t realize that i had value outside of my sexual worth.
my entire inner, mental life - and those of all the women i’ve had the pleasure of having deep, truthful intimate exchanges with - is even darker than i was aware of. even more filled with rotten baggage covered with glitter, humor, sarcasm &amp; other well-sharpened tools and armor.
{thread} deep breath. today is #WorldMentaHealthDay and i wanted to say a few words about “mr. weinstein will see you now” and about what inspired the song, then the video. i’m a lifelong feminist but it wasn’t until the recent uptick in assault cases that i stopped &amp; realized:
dear @people magazine, the fact that you picked up “mr weinstein will see you now” is nothing short of a miracle. thank you for being brave enough to share content this bold unapologetic piece of art on your massive platform. we raise our fists at you. x https://t.co/HbvYNSMBJT

@AyannaPressley @womensmarch @BostonGlobe THANK YOU FOR WRITING THIS. X
@IjeomaOluo @womensmarch on it.
listening to final mixes for approval and changes, wondering which songs to cut, trying not cry too much.i can’t believe this is what i am doing today. i’m clocking in at 71 minutes. i just googled “boys for pele”’s running time. 70 minutes. i think i’m in the clear. fuck it. https://t.co/KF7gSLIe6s
look at that video. there’s not only me, there’s 60 other women in there and all the women who worked behind the scenes. you’re not alone. https://t.co/xf9sBjJQVf
@RelativelyMe the revolt is literally now. now.
dear andrew. no. love, amanda. https://t.co/g1HNmqG8Qy
stay tuned. i will let you know what we come up with. i am thinking of trying to band together a group of female artists and musicians to get together a creative bloc of voices. and meanwhile, ask everybody you know to vote. vote. vote. https://t.co/lkyqihFW6q
ironic tweets aside: this is a difficult time for everyone, and for the artists and women who make up a big part of my circle, there is a general feeling that we are going to have to become more extreme if things are going to turn around. please help us, here, to organize. yes?
happy Everything’s Fucked day !!!
yes https://t.co/eDZmpYGY80
YES. THIS. join @emilyslist to support and educate yourself about female candidates. https://t.co/1gxoce4JCN

@KariByron thank you so much kari. please share it if you can. there has been practically no media coverage, and absolute silence from the feminist press. x
@Librocubculrist @SchoolonWheels that’s so fucking wonderful.
who wants to share some small, seemingly insignificant GOOD NEWS today to combat the tidal wave of crushingly bad news? I’LL START: the neighbor 2 doors down from my rental in LA is giving away free guavas from their backyard, complete with bilingual sign! i took three! now you! https://t.co/wQEMr7uoJ4

“MR WEINSTEIN WILL SEE YOU NOW” is a crowdfunded artistic battlecry made by over 60 women. today marks 1 year since the NYtimes exposé blasted open #MeToo, but the timing could not be more relevant due to kavanaugh.

@pygmywhales nothing is pointless. think of all of this as a massive cold water wave that has the capacity to wake up humanity like never, ever before in human history. feel it all. but feel awake. or we will all drown together.

@loladiana FUCK YES. i am making a super personal record as we speak, including one of the best songs i’ve ever written. about abortion. it’s zero coincidence. so it must be. the zeitgeist is engaged in a marathon tango with all artists right now.
dear everybody. channel your anger. if you have time today, make some art. anything. you don’t have to show it to anybody and it absolutely does not have to be good. make sounds. paint shapes. write something. take plants and arrange. anything. make some art. love, amanda

kavanaugh or no, NOTHING CAN NOW STOP THE AVALANCHE of truth &amp; power that women are finally - after too many millennia of this shit - reclaiming. we will vote. and march. we will make art. but most importantly, we will continue to relentlessly tell our stories. watch this space. https://t.co/K8amqYnOEN

no. it’s about my ability to express from the core, unhindered. i’m fucking ready. this album is going to be a wrecking ball. (this little video by my soul brother @jherekbischoff who is in the studio as one of my song midwives. not pictured, my engineer midwife john congleton.)
...many reasons (so many) i never would have been able to get my head into this kind of place - to write this kind of song for public consumption - had i stayed on my old major label. make no mistake: this kind of independence that i have is not really about money:
....that has literally taken me twenty years to figure out how to write. something is coming unlocked everywhere. i am so proud of this whole record. i am also feeling the profound and unwavering support of the 12,000 patrons who are behind me on this record. for so....
{thread} i do not feel like it is one single bit of coincidence that the day i wake up to christine blasey’s testimony &amp; weep at the state of this country is also the day i go into the recording studio to officially commit to tape the solo piano &amp; voice song about abortion... https://t.co/IE2RwBcONv

the laughing. this is the moment that got me the most. to be assaulted and terrified....while hearing the easy, drunken laughter. that’s the darkest. those two universes. theirs: a party, a girl, good times. hers: hell; fear. so many women know this feeling.

i’m gonna post to the patreon about it, where it would live, but how do y’all feel about an Amanda Fucking Book Club? would you read/discuss books with me? i’m back to reading more voraciously now that the kid has turned 3 and we also have to change the world right quick.

@oni_wuv haha that ain’t burlesque. that’s pure performance art baby.
@properdepravity i could have been a pretty great pianist, instead i settled for being a pretty nice person and a pretty good pianist. i’m very happy with my choice. the choice to be a killer piano player would have led me down a path that i don’t think would have served my personhood.
@oni_wuv wait. i do burlesque? where? when? i wanna see that.
@ThomasDBS @rekk38 @sdx76 @neilhimself well obviously https://t.co/9O804vhTsk
took the day off today, studio cost be damned, because my voice is still thin from a lingering cold (thanks, ash). instead, my fingers practiced. can’t remember the last time i sat down and just rehearsed complicated runs for four hours. i am a bad pianist. i am a good pianist.

good morning everyone. last night i fought the jetlag &amp; went to a screening of @MMFlint’s new film “Fahrenheit 11/9” here in LA. it was in turns depressing, funny, irreverent, infuriating. i doubt it’ll be seen by many trump supporters, much less change many political minds. but
@YaMomN_Ems i was being sarcastic.

my british friend on the train just informed me that it’s “bollocks”. that’s what you get clearly.
in closing: this is what i did my TED talk &amp; wrote my book, “the art of asking” about, and every word of it is even more true in 2018. and it’s been viewed almost 10,000,000 times and the book’s a bestseller, so i must have gotten something right, suckers. https://t.co/BlVYrlMyUE
i don’t plan on stopping this anti-stigma battle until EVERY artist i know feels 100% okay with saying “hey, instead of buying this art from a third party, why not just support me directly so i can actually use all that money for materials, help and rent?”
anyway. i feel so strongly about this that i have spent a good part of the past ten years explaining it, giving about it, losing sleep and managers over it. i’ve earned a respectable but un-envied reputation in the music business for being a total outlier and non-game-player...
yes i said bullocks, get off my case mate i am in london now i can say bullocks if i want
i still see so much stigma when it comes to artists feeling like they can directly “ask” their fans/listeners/audience/readers for support. we have all been so fucking conditioned to thinking we need a middleman to look legit and seem big and important. and it’s just bullocks.
i have used so called “direct to fan” (i prefer to call them “punk rock”) methods for 20 years. i have used @kickstarter. i use @patreon. i have learned so, so much. and the biggest  thing i have learned is that capitalism/standard commerce and true artistry are difficult friends
to all artists out there, and to all the people who love art/music/writing/you-name-it (and that is pretty much everyone i know): DON’T BE AFRIAD TO LET ART+COMMERCE BE WHAT IT IS: MESSY AS FUCK. the commercial and big-media world wants to you to think otherwise.
it’s #artistpayday. i hope every freelance artist out there remembers: WE LIVE IN A CAPITALIST SOCIETY, yes. but art will never quite fit in a perfect box with a perfect price tag. human connection &amp; expression is not $.99 a track, nor is it $10/month for unlimited streaming....

@WoollyWormhead happy to help you find people. if you tag me, i can share a post. x
you are psychic. neil was saying last night - while almost asleep - that perhaps it is time for him to go behind the trees. all of my work is for nought. (thanks for sharing it. hooray for patron-funded-art that would never exist otherwise). https://t.co/SS4aza4wTz

@MsRobieS THANK CHRIST !!! all people everywhere. i’ll pretend it wasn’t a bad omen for the trip. by the way: i was actually in his way. but he could have asked me to move. *sigh*
@bringyourownsun true fax.
@misterjoeblack it’s so interpretable. i always assumed it was coffee.
@YPattison here to do album prep &amp; spend time with my (very nice) british husband and half-breed child for a few weeks. neil’s in the UK through years end working on his good omens tv show for the bbc. after this i go record my magnum opus. i may squeeze in a patron-thing! playing by ear.
@misterjoeblack wait is that coffee or tea
@unicorn it’s like the birdsong of this species.
@misterjoeblack an abundance of choices at the passive aggressive buffet of life !!
@riotbadger i know. americans sigh too. but this was such a....british....passive aggressive....übersigh. i wasn’t even joking. i kinda have missed it. british people be so british.
my first interaction with a british person upon returning to the UK. man in train station sighs at me loudly &amp; dramatically because i’m in his way. me, with many suitcases: “i’ve missed the way people sigh in the UK!” him: totally aghast. hello, brits. i am american. watch out.
@garethlpowell o shit
@sandylakdar thanks sandy !!
@FelixHagan i’ve got great leads on private hire rehearsal spaces. was more hoping someone had a living room they weren’t using...i like nooky little spaces.
@jamesmoran WILL. GO. thank you for this.

i’m so sorry to hear that. it’s bizarre. we are tribal, and are tribe on the internet isn’t quite one we can manage or understand. i wonder what’s going to happen to us; whether we we figure it out. x https://t.co/5Fv2xrODiO

@_TeDiouS_ i don’t hate the student. i hate the system. it’s the equivalent to me waving a warning at a musician before selling all of their publishing to a major label in a shitty 360 deal. you can do it: but the cost isn’t worth it.
@ShayneCassidy it’s the blurry insidiousness.
college students, if you’re listening to me: RESIST!!!! and if you see a friend using their social feeds to Advertise You Some Bullshit, gently tell them that they are losing your trust. we are human beings, godammit, cannot we try to retain SOME dignity? https://t.co/EucV5cmwCi

top new patron comment of the day: "As a 65yo military retiree...living in South Carolina since leaving the military, I may seem a bit of an outlier in your mob, but I have enjoyed your music and long admired your forthrightness. Art, after all, does not apologize." DAMN SKIPPY&lt;3
so join if you can. it’s $1/month to join this wondrous community....and support me &amp; these groundbreaking filmmakers/artists make more totally non-commercial, non-corporatist and, tbh, NON-MARKETABLE artwork. it’s so inspiring watching this happen. https://t.co/vPv0UWrIT2
this is why i love patreon. i am making art for those who care about honesty, experimentation, progress, real art. i don’t want to imagine what this person would have posted if they’d seen the actual, entire 7 minute video. i shudder to think. but i don’t have to shudder anymore.
and someone named ‘vito missing bear’ on instagram commented under this photo: “well there goes my breakfast”. this is what i replied: https://t.co/AkRdgVCSfc
the comments and stories that the video have been drawing out are bringing me - and a lot of other people, apparently - to tears. we have so much shame around our own bodies, it’s absolutely bananas. we have also welcomed 500+ new people to the patreon in the last few days...
{thread} mother nature was on our team for this shoot. that sunset, people. this was on the film set last september w/ skye ferrante &amp; @popecinema making the first round of footage for “REWIRED”, which we released 2 days ago.... https://t.co/vPv0UWrIT2 https://t.co/iE9ABcAL1x

i’ve been asking patreon that for three years. if you’re not a patron, you can set it up for her with your card but with her name. but lu can’t directly “gift” patronage to someone. it’s frustrating. xx https://t.co/2r7ZkoF6uc

you’ve impressed me, scotland. finally opening up presents that you gave to @aaalex555 at the edinburgh merch table. highlights: a broken pocketwatch, leaves, some great books, a painting of a bloodshot eye &amp; a paper bag full of yeast. you guys win some sort of surrealist prize. https://t.co/uRnySC3jUD
