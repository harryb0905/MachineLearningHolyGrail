@dbctravels Appreciate the media theory refresher, but this is the crux of the problem: “You report to Facebook, they do nothing,” one of the researchers (in Sri Lanka)said. “There’s incitements to violence against entire communities and Facebook says it doesn’t violate community standards.”
@dbctravels And that’s precisely the issue — as you say, “*amplified* by algorithms” at a scope and scale we’ve never dealt with before. This is because of the platform. The platform is reaping the benefits of scale. What about bearing some of the responsibility?
