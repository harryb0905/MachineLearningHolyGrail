Aunt Marie sent this to us from PA, and thought the leaders in DC should give it a read. Agreed, and I also think it’s good for the rest of us too. https://t.co/5u7R6zyQPi

#ExposeChristianSchools I was surrounded by people who cared about me as a human being, not just a student. I got a top notch education that allowed me to graduate magma cum laude undergrad and w honors from law school.  It wasn’t perfect, but there was a high standard and love.
UPDATE:  Pres @realDonaldTrump remarks regarding the border moved to 4pm ET.
Yup - standing by @DanCrenshawTX @AOC https://t.co/IXAOzk8AfD
11p @FoxNews @FoxNewsNight - Special Counsel's office knocks down BuzzFeed's claim that POTUS directed his former lawyer to lie to Congress.  BuzzFeed stands by the story.  Tonight, both the Pres @realDonaldTrump and his current lawyer speak out.  We've got the latest coming up!
Ha!  And the night is still young 😉 https://t.co/4EHw5kMsKj
BREAKING:  Spokesman for Special Counsel's Office - "BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate."
Apparently you weren't listening when I noted that he has lied to Congress and is in big trouble on multiple fronts. https://t.co/O5aqFnd4xg
Wasn't about that.  It was that the salon workers are now losing money and worrying about their own income. https://t.co/9ENk8f0uHc
Always the goal - just the facts.  If someone thinks I'm rooting for or against the President, they are more likely than not projecting their own pro/anti Trump emotions.  #peace https://t.co/VGWwvMyuuI

SenBlumenthal pressing Barr on whether or not a sitting president can be indicted.
SenFeinstein now asking Barr about "drawing the line" on interrogations.  Asks if torture is lawful.  Barr - no.
SenFeinstein asks Barr:  Will you provide Mueller's report to Congress, not a re-write or summary?  Barr:  regulations say Mueller is supposed to do a summary of decisions and will be handled as confidential documents.  My goal is to get as much out as I can to the public.
Barr says priority with violent gun crime is keeping firearms out of the hands of those who are mentally ill.  "Won't be easy"
SenTillis asks Barr - Have you ever been on record trying to stop the various Russia and Mueller investigations?  Barr - no.
SenHarris says to Barr - the war on drugs was an "abject failure".  Adds - locking these people up is not the smartest use of tax dollars.
SenHarris asks Barr - are you aware that most illegal drugs come through ports of entry?  Barr - yes.
SenHarris asks Barr - are you advocating for a wall?  Barr - I'm advocating for a system.  Wall may not be necessary in all places.
SenHarris now up in Barr hearing - thanks him for lifetime of public service.
SenBlackburn - new to the Senate (formerly of the House) and new to the @senjudiciary Committee now questioning Barr.
SenBooker to Barr - will you commit to meeting with me?  Barr - I'd very much welcome that, Senator.
SenBooker begins his questions to Barr talking about states with legalized marijuana vs. federal drug laws.
SenKennedy to Barr - I'd encourage you to make the final Mueller report public.  Let people see it for themselves and let's move on.
Barr on "universal injunctions" -  I'd like to see these challenged.
SenKennedy asking Barr about "universal injunctions" - which allow a single federal judge to block something nationwide.  Barr - relatively new phenomenon, it should be limited to the parties in the case or controversy.
SenKennedy asks Barr if he's Catholic and whether that should disqualify him.  Kennedy says "some of my colleagues might think so."  Barr says no - cites "render unto Caesar what is Caesar's"
SenKennedy asks Barr - Do you believe ICE should be abolished.  Barr - certainly not.
SenKennedy now asking Barr about the issue of leaks from within DOJ.
Barr:  all I can say right now is - my goal and intent it to get as much information out as I can consistent with the law.
Barr - as the rules stand now - I think they say the Special Counsel will prepare a summary report on any prosecutorial decisions - will be confidential.  In addition, the AG is responsible for notifying and reporting certain information upon conclusion of investigation.
SenHirono to Barr - are you saying Mueller investigation is confidential - and all we'll get is YOUR report on the Mueller report?  Barr - I don't know, at the end of the day, will be releasable.  I don't know what Mueller is writing.
SenHirono now asking Barr about various Trump-related investigations out of the Southern Dist of NY.  Asks:  do you consider them to be lawful investigations?  Barr:  I have no reason to think they're not lawful investigations - whatever they are.
SenBlumenthal asks Barr if he'll make sure Mueller team has all resources it needs.  Barr says it sounds like they're winding down, doesn't see that would be any problem.
See you at 2pm! @dailybriefing @FoxNews https://t.co/89m4xvRQDy
SenBlumenthal questioning Barr about how much of the Mueller report he'll allow to go public.  Barr - My purpose is to get as much accurate information out as I can within the law.
Thanks @thetoyman1 - You've put me in excellent company 😉 https://t.co/ewIjjtNdcB

SenDurbin now asking Barr about "zero tolerance" policy Durbin says destroy families who come to the US  (illegally)
SenDurbin asks Barr - What would be your breaking point?  What would be your Mattis moment if you had to walk out?  Doesn't it give you pause to have to consider that?  Barr - if I was in my 40s, 50s - not anymore.  Barr - I won't be bullied by editorial bds, Congress, POTUS.
SenDurbin to Barr - You see like a rational person.  When you consider what Sessions went through with POTUS, why do you want this job?  Barr - because I love the Dept and they're critical to preserving the rule of law.
SenCornyn asks Barr - do you agree that re-establishing FBI/DOJ as apolitical is important?  Barr - yes - that's why I'm sitting here.  I think I can help.
SenCornyn asks Barr about Comey announcement of decision not to pursue charges against HRC.  Barr says - If you're not going to indict someone, you don't stand up there and unload negative information.  That's not how the DOJ operates.
SenLeahy says Barr has criticized the Russia probe.  Barr:  "How have I criticized the Russian probe?"  Barr says - we have to get to the bottom of Russian interference

Barr says he was approached about discussing legal strategy for the President.  Barr says he didn't want to put his heat into "that meat grinder" - but agreed to meet with POTUS.  Brief meeting, POTUS asked how well I knew Mueller.  Told him we were good friends.  (cont)
SenGrassley asks Barr:  You've been very tough on crime in the past.  Will you commit to fully implementing the First Step Act? (recently-passed, bipartisan crim justice reform)  Barr:  yes
SenGrassley to Barr:  All you Cabinet people come up here and tell us "Yes" you're gonna answer our stuff.  If you'd like to say "maybe" - you can say that.  I expect you to respond to my October letter if we get you voted in.
SenGrassley (former Chair of this Committee) now questioning AG Nominee Barr
SenFeinstein asks Barr:  Have you discussed the Mueller investigation with POTUS or anyone in the WH?  Barr - yes, not in any particular substance.  I'd be happy to walk through those conversations with you.  Feinstein - not at this time, may come back to it.
SenFeinstein asks Barr if it's true the President interviewed him and asked him to join legal team?  Barr - I had one conversation June 2017 - happy to relate that to you.
SenFeinstein asks Barr - Has anyone given you non-public info about Mueller investigation?  Barr - I do not recall getting any such information

AG nominee (and former AG 91-93) Bill Barr says:   In the best interest of everyone that this matter be resolve by allowing Mueller to complete his work.  The country needs a resolution to these matters.  On my watch, Bob will be allowed to finish his work.
AG nominee (and former AG 91-93) Bill Barr says:  I believe it's vitally impt that Special Counsel be able to complete his investigation.  I have the utmost respect for Bob (Mueller) and his intellect.  I have confidence he'll handle things fairly.

SenGraham @ #BarrHearing - Just a reminder that Senate rules prohibit outbursts, etc.  I've asked US Capitol Police to take out anyone who disrupts.
SenFeinstein @ #BarrHearing:  Do you have the strength to resist pressures from the White House - which you will undoubtedly face?
SenFeinstein @ #BarrHearing:  There are q's about your willingness to reach a conclusion before you know all the facts
SenFeinstein @ #BarrHearing:  Just 5 months before you were nominated - I read over the memo you sent unsolicited to DOJ - concluding that the Mueller team had no good obstruction of justice case against POTUS re:  Comey firing
SenFeinstein @ #BarrHearing:  Please that you've publicly and privately affirmed the principle that the Mueller investigation must be able to proceed unhindered
SenFeinstein @ #BarrHearing:  Now more than ever AG needs to be "people's lawyer" not "the president's lawyer" - must be willing to resist political pressure
#BarrHearing starts - New @senjudiciary Chair @LindseyGrahamSC reminds everyone Barr was previously confirmed - unanimously - in a Dem-controlled Senate.  Also notes this time the vote may be a little different experience ...

Breaking down the President’s speech and the Democrats’ response as Pres @realDonaldTrump prepares to head to the border on Thursday - 11p ET @FoxNews @FoxNewsNight https://t.co/QrnmiO4mI8
SenSchumer says:  Reopen the govt and then we can work to resolve our differences over border security.
SenSchumer says:  No excuse for hurting millions of Americans over policy differences.
SenSchumer says:   Separate the shutdown from arguments over border security.
SenSchumer says:  POTUS has appealed to fear, not facts - division, not unity.  Make no mistake - POTUS and Dems both want secure borders.  We disagree about how to do it.
SenSchumer says:  POTUS has shut down the govt.  American democracy doesn't work that way.  We don't govern by temper tantrum.
SpkrPelosi says:  POTUS must stop holding Americans hostage, manufacturing crisis and re-open the govt.
SpkrPelosi says:  We can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.  Women, children at border are not a security threat.
SpkrPelosi says:   We all agree we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values.
SpkrPelosi says:   POTUS holding Americans hostage.
SpkrPelosi says:  POTUS is rejecting bipartisan solutions over obsession w/ expensive and ineffective wall.
SpkrPelosi:  Sadly, much of what we've heard from POTUS has been misinfo and malice.  "The President has chosen fear."
POTUS from Oval Office:  I swore to protect our country and that is what I will always do, so help me God.  Thank you and good night.
POTUS from Oval Office:  To Congress - pass a bill that ends this crisis.  Citizens - call Congress and tell them to secure our border.  "This is a choice between right and wrong."
POTUS from Oval Office:  If barrier is immoral why do wealthy politicians build walls around their homes?  Don't build walls b/c they hate people on the outside, but bc they love the people on the inside.
POTUS from Oval Office:  This could be solved in 45 min meeting.  I've invited Congressional leadership to WH tomorrow to get this done.  Hope we can rise above partisan politics.
POTUS from Oval Office:  Sen Schumer and other Dems have supported barrier at border in the past.  Positions only changed after I was elected.
POTUS from Oval Office:  Wall will be paid for indirectly by our new trade deal with Mexico.
POTUS from Oval Office:  Border wall would very quickly pay for itself.  Costs related to illegal drugs tops $500B a year.
POTUS from Oval Office:  Law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7B for physical barrier.  Per Democrats' request - it'll be steel barrier rather than concrete wall.
POTUS from Oval Office:  We've requested more agents, immigration judges and bed space.  Also - an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.  Asking Congress to close loopholes.
POTUS from Oval Office:  We've put together a proposal based on what law enforcement and border patrol tell us they need.
POTUS from Oval Office:  This is a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.  Children are being used as human pawns by ruthless coyotes and gangs.  Women being sexually assaulted.  Women/Children biggest victims of tragedy on southern border.
POTUS from Oval Office:  Thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now.
POTUS from Oval Office:  Heroin and meth - 90% floods across southern border.
POTUS from Oval Office:  African Americans and Hispanic Americans are hit hardest by illegal immigration.
POTUS from Oval Office:  There is a growing humanitarian and national security crisis at the border.  We're out of space to hold illegal immigrants and have no way to return them to their home countries.
Will Pres @realDonaldTrump announce a national emergency tonight with regard to the border?

J.Kavanaugh says:  I'm still an optimist.
J.Kavanaugh says:  Although the Senate confirmation process tested me, it did not change me or my approach to judging.  I must be neutral, impartial, independent.
J.Kavanaugh says:  I will seek to be a force for stability and unity.  My goal is to be a great justice for all Americans.  I was appointed not to serve one party or interest, but to serve one nation.
J.Kavanaugh calls his wife his "rock" and says he thanks God every day for her and for his family.
J.Kavanaugh says:  My daughters are smart, strong, awesome girls.  I thank their teachers for giving them the day off tomorrow so they can come watch two cases being argued at the Supreme Court.

J.Kavanaugh says:  As a new Justice, I understand the responsibility that I bear.
J.Kavanaugh says:  The Supreme Court is an institution of law.  It is not partisan or political.  The Justices do not sit on separate sides of the aisle.  We are a team of 9.  I will always be a team player.
J.Kavanaugh says:  I'm honored to serve on a court headed by Chief Justice John Roberts.  I'm honored to serve along side all of my new colleagues.  We all revere the Constitution.
J.Kavanaugh says:  "Mr. President, thank you for everything."
J.Kavanaugh says:  Thank you for the great honor of appointing me.  I am grateful for your steadfast, unwavering support throughout this process.

RepPelosi reaction:  "Today is a profoundly heart-breaking day for women, girls and families across America."
Feinstein: Confirmation "shifts the Supreme Court far to the right, putting women’s reproductive rights, civil rights, environmental protections, worker’s rights, the ability to implement gun safety rules and the ability to hold presidents accountable at risk for a generation."
CONFIRMED:  Judge Kavanaugh will be administered both the Constitutional Oath (by Chief Justice Roberts) and the Judicial Oath (by retired Justice Kennedy - for whom Kavanaugh clerked) TODAY so he can get to work "immediately."

You heard it - SenCollins is a YES on #Kavanaugh
SenCollins on floor now:  I have been alarmed and disturbed by those who say unless senate rejects Kavanaugh it approves of sex assault
SenCollins on floor now:  allegations should at least reach “more likely than not” - not saying Ford was not assaulted that night or another time - but we don’t get to “more likely than not” based on what she’s provided
SenCollins on floor now:  I found Ford’s testimony to be sincere and compelling. I believe she’s a victim of a sexual assault, but none of her witnesses could corroborate.
SenCollins on floor now:  calls gang rape allegations “outrageous” and with no corroborating evidence
SenCollins on floor now:  I worry that departing from the presumption of innocence would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process moving forward
SenCollins on floor now:  in evaluating any claim we aren’t served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence
SenCollins on floor now:  the confirmation process now involves whether Kavanaugh committed sexual assault and lied about it
SenCollins on floor now:  now addressing temperament - notes perfect ABA rating
SenCollins on floor now:  Kavanaugh believes no president is above the law.
SenCollins on floor now:  I do not agree with those who think Kavanaugh will gut Obamacare.
SenCollins on floor now:  I’ve met with thousands of my constituents on both sides.
SenCollins on floor now:  I have reviewed Kavanaugh’s lengthy record - opinions, articles, etc. I met with Kavanaugh for 2+ hours privately.  Talked with him a 2nd time for another hour.
SenCollins on floor now:  I voted for Roberts, Alito, Sotomayor, Kagan and Gorsuch.
SenCollins on floor now:  I fully expect nominee to put aside any and all preferences in deciding cases. I never consider Pres identity or party.
SenCollins on floor now:  Pres has broad discretion.  My duty is to focus on nominee’s qualifications.
SenCollins on floor now:  the SCOTUS confirmation process has steadily deteriorated over last 30 years
SenCollins on floor now:  over the top rhetoric and false statements - even after debunked- lived on
SenCollins on floor now: talking about opposition before #Kavanaugh was even announced
SenSusanCollins on the floor NOW. About to announce her #Kavanaugh vote.

If you've gotten news whiplash today - join us at 11pm ET @FoxNews - We'll break down all the #Kavanaugh developments with our legal eagles and a personal friend of the family.  On #Rosenstein we'll talk with author of #DeepState @jasoninthehouse Plus, Iran w/ @DanielHoffmanDC
SenSchumer on Senate floor: "If you really believed these allegations are part of a despicable smear job, Leader McConnell, why don’t you call for an FBI investigation? What are you afraid of? What are you hiding? What is Judge Kavanaugh hiding?"
McConnell says:  Before the week is out both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh will be heard under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee - We'll have an up or down vote on Kavanaugh on the Senate floor in the very near future
McConnell says:  Come Thursday, Dr. Ford can make her case under oath and Judge Kavanaugh will respond.  But that was just Act 1.  Now they're calling for further delays and obstruction.  Even NYT refused to run a story about second accuser.  "So dubious the NYT passed entirely"
McConnell says:  Dems won't let something like complete lack of evidence or accuser's request for anonymity get between them and a good smear.
McConnell says:  Under penalty of felony all alleged witnesses said they do not remember such a party and/or never saw Kavanaugh do anything remotely like what Ford has alleged.
McConnell says:  Democrats sat on Dr. Ford's letter for 7 weeks, kept it secret, did nothing - then they threw Professor Ford's wishes overboard and leaked it to the press.
McConnell says:  This is what the so-called resistance has become, a smear campaign plain and simple - aided and abetted by members of the United States Senate.
Sen Majority Leader Mitch McConnell LIVE now on Senate floor ... https://t.co/vv9wRnXJsf

BREAKING - Kavanaugh letter to Grassley https://t.co/tKauHUSk6W
The (albeit fantastic) flight attendant cannot actually be telling me to turn off my phone at this moment 😭 #Rosenstein #Kavanaugh #UNGA
Monday.  It’s only Monday. https://t.co/Etcg6SkM9Q
“Ms. Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recalled the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself.” – NYT (2/2)
“In her initial conversations with The New Yorker, she was reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh’s role in the alleged incident with certainty. After six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough ...” 1/2
SenFeinstein to SenGrassley: “I am writing to request an immediate postponement of any further proceedings related to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.”
Can we start by defining “demanding the opportunity to present testimony”?  Are you proposing immediate sworn statement? Meeting with Senate investigators?  Giving live testimony?  Timeline? https://t.co/QQielLlJG4
Made some new friends at church this morning 🤗 Deeba and Darius from Iran 🙏🏼 https://t.co/grvtRLJKM2
BREAKING Ford’s attys: “We committed to moving forward with an open hearing on Thursday Sept 27 at 10:00 am. Despite actual threats to her safety and her life, Dr. Ford believes it is important for Senators to hear directly from her about the sexual assault committed against her.
Thoughts? https://t.co/6Vb8n1EdAV
Atty for person alleged to be at party:  “Simply put, [my client] does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.”
Committee source says they wouldn’t characterize discussions w Ford’s legal team as “negotiations”.  Say they’ve consented to half of Ford team’s demands, now waiting for some concessions from the other side. “We’re where we are when her attorney said on Monday she’d testify.”
Committee source says they’ve contacted five people alleged to be at party.  4 deny any knowledge of the party and allegations.  5th person - Dr. Ford - is the only one who has not provided them a statement. #Kavanaugh
Again talking to my 93 year old grandmother about assisted living. Same response as always, “I don’t want to be hanging out with a bunch of old people!”  😂
WH on #Kavanaugh: “Since then, we have heard about different dates, conditions, and ever changing schedules, but today we appear no closer to a fair hearing.  But one thing has remained consistent: Brett Kavanaugh remains ready, willing and eager to testify as soon as possible.”
WH on #Kavanaugh (cont) “On Monday, Brett Kavanaugh met with Committee counsels to answer questions subject to criminal penalties and offered to testify publicly Tuesday morning... (cont)
WH statement on #Kavanaugh: ““Brett Kavanaugh has been clear from the beginning—he categorically and unequivocally denies this allegation and is eager to testify publicly to defend his integrity and clear his good name... (cont)
SenWhitehouse statement:  “Dr. Blasey Ford made it clear to the Committee she is willing to testify next week with reasonable precautions for her safety and ground rules to ensure a fair hearing.  She did so in spite of Republicans’ astounding disregard for basic due process ...”

If the name sounds familiar, Bromwich has been representing Former Dep FBI Director Andrew McCabe. https://t.co/ItsDyMTAmx
Sources tell us Ford team has been pushing for Thursday, while Committee has reportedly been suggesting Wednesday.  (2/2)
SenBlumenthal statement:   “Courageously, Dr. Ford will tell her story in the face of an impossible choice and vile bullying by Republican leadership. I will support her steadfast bravery against the arbitrary, unfair, irrational constraints set by Chairman Grassley.” (1/2)
WH official tells Fox: This is an ask to continue “negotiations” without committing to anything. It’s a clever way to push off the vote Monday without committing to appear Wednesday. https://t.co/YQj7A1MmsI
BREAKING:  Ford atty to SJ Committee “... we are disappointed with the leaks and the bullying that have tainted the process, we are hopeful that we can reach agreement on details.  Can we set up a time for later this afternoon to continue our negotiations?” #Kavanaugh
Congrats, you guys! 🥂 https://t.co/HT45AcOhOw
Lots of news breaking late tonight. So happy my buddy @MikeEmanuelFox is ready to rock and roll! 11p @FoxNews @FoxNewsNight https://t.co/mzmaJXTV7n
Dr. Ford atty to SJ Committee - “She has already been forced out of her home and continues to be subjected to harassment, hate mail, and death threats.  Our modest request is that she be given an additional day to make her decision.” (meaning Saturday)
BREAKING:  Dr. Ford atty letter to SJ Committee - “The 10:00 p.m. deadline is arbitrary.  Its sole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-altering implications for her and her family.”
BREAKING:  Dr. Ford atty letter to SJ Committee - “The imposition of aggressive and artificial deadlines regarding the date and conditions of any hearing has created tremendous and unwarranted anxiety and stress on Dr. Ford.”  More ...

Senate staffer:  It only makes sense for the accused to follow and respond to the charges.  Judge #Kavanaugh would obviously follow Dr. Ford.
Senate staffer:  Committee doesn't issue subpoenas in the process of considering nominations.  Other alleged witnesses made clear they have no intention of testifying.  #Kavanaugh
I'm not the world's most experienced atty, but can't recall the defense ever going FIRST...
SOURCES:  Ford team wants NO questions from lawyers, only Qs from Committee members, #Kavanaugh cannot be in the room, Kavanaugh must testify FIRST  - more to come ...
Kavanaugh ltr to Grassley:  "I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name.  Since the moment I first heard this allegation, I have categorically and unequivocally denied it.  I remain committed to defending my integrity." (3/3)
Kavanaugh ltr to Grassley (cont):  "I also appreciate the time that Committee staff took to interview me on Monday, September 17.  During that interview, I twice requested a Committee hearing for the following day, Tuesday, September 18."  (2/3)
Kavanaugh ltr to Grassley:  "Thank you for the invitation to appear before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on Monday, September 24.  I will be there.  I look forward to the opportunity to testify before the Committee." (1/3)
If the questions aren’t all #Kavanaugh related, I’m toast. See you tonight! @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews https://t.co/NnEYYBWsNr

In for my buddy @BretBaier tonight - See you at 6pm @FoxNews - back at 11pm b/c ... well, it never stops these days, does it?  @FoxNewsNight
New Grassley ltr to SJC Dems: "There has been delay and obstruction of this process at every turn and with every argument available.  Therefore, I will view any additional complaints about the process very skeptically."
New Grassley ltr to SJC Dems: "Of course, we wouldn't find ourselves in this position if we had been made aware of the allegations in a timelier manner.  The Ranking Member was aware of these allegations since July."
New Grassley ltr to SJC Dems: "It is my understanding that Dr. Ford has been represented by counsel in this matter for months and thus should be adequately prepared to testify." (Monday)
New Grassley ltr to SJC Dems: "As is standard practice, we invited the Minority staff to participate and ask Judge Kavanaugh its own questions, but the Minority staff declined."
New Grassley ltr to SJC Dems: "Judge Kavanaugh ... sat for a transcribed interview on Monday.  He understood that he was under penalty of felony, if he was not truthful.  He fully, candidly, and unequivocally answered all questions."
New Grassley ltr to SJC Dems: "Because Dr. Ford's allegations are in the public arena, there is no longer a need for a confidential FBI investigation."
New Grassley ltr to SJC Dems:  "I certainly understand why Dr. Ford might be distrustful of the Committee's ability to keep matters confidential based on the Democratic members' recent conduct ..."
See you at 6pm! @FoxNews @SpecialReport   #stop #paneltime https://t.co/SgEtZ10TDJ
BREAKING:  SJCommittee source tells me they are willing to send staffers to Dr. Ford at her chosen location to get her story in person. Unclear if that would be in lieu of Monday’s hearing or a prelude to it. #Kavanaugh

Ltr from Christine Blasey Ford atty to Grassley: "A full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing..."
Ltr from atty for Christine Blasey Ford to Grassley: "... you and your staff scheduled a public hearing for her to testify at the same table as Judge Kavanaugh ..." and  "... an FBI investigation of the incident should be the first step in addressing her allegations."
BREAKING:  Letter from 2nd man Dr. Ford says was in room during alleged assault, Mark Judge - "I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes."  Says he has no memory of the alleged incident, has no information to offer Committee and doesn't want to speak publicly.

SenBooker now appears to be doing "lightning round" giving #Kavanaugh case names and asking to say only whether it was a right/wrong decision.  #Kavanaugh tries to explain the obligation he has to follow precedent regardless of his personal feelings.  Booker not allowing answers.
11p @FoxNews @FoxNewsNight - Every twist in today's #KavanaughHearing - plus Sen @ChuckGrassley on WHEN @SenBooker knew the emails he released this morning were already cleared for public release, @SenSasse on whether the hearings have been nothing but political theater &amp; more!
Beyond blessed to call these two FRIENDS (and co-workers ; ) @FoxNewsNight https://t.co/Wd9f03dRjx
SenHarris now talking about "heartbreaking separations of parents and children" - because of "this administration"
#Kavanaugh cites J. Kagan (as a nominee) - can't give a thumbs up or down
#Kavanaugh referring to various key cases that led to Obergefell decision - and noting that it is precedent.  SenHarris says she doesn't want to hear the history - she knows it.  Kavanaugh says nominees should decline to hint at any position they would take.
SenHarris now pushing #Kavanaugh on whether he thinks Obergefell was rightly decided (legalizing same sex marriage) - wants his "personal opinion" on whether it was correctly decided.
#Kavanaugh says - if I committed to any particular action regarding a case that may come before me - I'd be demonstrating I don't actually have independence
SenBooker to #Kavanaugh - calls on him to "right now" vow "you will recuse" from any civil or criminal case involving Pres @realDonaldTrump
SenBooker now talking about anonymous NYT piece, says we're all going to be tested - Constitutional crisis - faith in this country could be shaken - really impt SCOTUS be above suspicion
#Kavanaugh says to SenBooker - I think you should read my 12 years of opinions, look at my other documents - my whole life - and conclude that "I have the independence required to be a good judge"
#Kavanaugh says - my only loyalty is to the Constitution - I've made that clear
SenBooker says to #Kavanaugh - it's reasonable to suspect something is going on, that this is rigged (Trump picking him for SCOTUS)
SenBooker - Pres has been credible accused by his former lawyer of being an "unindicted co-conspirator."  (note:  this language does not appear in the legal documents)
SenBooker to #Kavanaugh - Suddenly you've gone mum on all this president's lies.
SenBooker says - you're not willing to comment on Pres's character, whether you respect him.  "I'm just wondering what kind of loyalty is being required of you for this job."
SenBooker asks, "Do you have the greatest respect for Donald Trump?"  #Kavanaugh says - "I appreciate the question" - but indicates he will stay away from politics.
SenBooker says to #Kavanaugh - "you talk a lot about character."  Booker says POTUS lies all the time.  "Do you think character matters for the Pres of the United States?"  Kavanaugh - I need to stay 3 zipcodes away from anything political.
We knew it would. https://t.co/vPmKMEXBB2
Numerous Dem senators have now presented statements by Pres @realDonaldTrump to #Kavanaugh and asked him whether he agrees.  SenHirono also asking him whether he's afraid to break with the Pres.  Kavanaugh says he's an independent judge - doesn't want to get involved in politics.
Throughout the afternoon, SenBooker is now releasing additional documents still under the "Committee Confidential" classification.  His team points out he is now actually violating the Senate process for the documents - which they also maintain he did last night during hearing.
Also breaking news:  2,300 Americans hospitalized by pizza in 2017 https://t.co/sTBQm8l1Bw via @MailOnline
Afternoon inbox:  "Women’s March: Kavanaugh Birth Control Position Makes This an Emergency, All-Hands-On-Deck Moment for Women" and "Women’s March on Kavanaugh Files Release: Cory Booker is a Patriot, Kavanaugh is a Lying Disaster"
Press corps is either so exhausted or so immune to it now that we are rarely batting an eyelash when someone stands up, yells at the top of their lungs and gets dragged out of a Senate hearing.  New normal? #Kavanaugh
#Kavanaugh introducing the young women he's coached on various basketball teams - now sitting in seats behind him.  As room applauds, SenFlake says, "Well, there goes my entire line of questioning."  Room laughs...
SenCoons to #Kavanaugh - We all know you are a good and capable man.  Need to know about your judicial philosophy.  #Kavanaugh smiles, thx - says they've known each other since law school.
I watched SenLee vow to help SenBooker get the documents released last night.  Lee then walked across the room, chatted quietly with Booker and they shook hands before Lee walked away.  All seemed pleasant around 8:45pm Weds  (2/2)
Neither SenBooker nor his staff will directly answer our Q about WHEN he knew the documents he released around 11am this morning were cleared for public release (Committee staff says 4am).  Instead, claims GOP was shamed into expediting release.  (1/2)
So, now we're being told (by Committee staffers) that SenBooker knew BEFORE he made these statements - that the documents in question had already been cleared for release.  That's a significant claim to make, so I've asked his office directly.  Will update if/when I get response. https://t.co/lNxx3wEVCZ
Senate Judiciary Committee staffers tell our @GriffJenkins that the documents SenBooker released today were already agreed to and cleared late LAST NIGHT.  Not clear exactly which senators knew that before Booker publicly announced he was willing to violate policy and release.
Miranda statement regarding allegations SenLeahy is making about "stolen email" shared with #Kavanaugh:  "Nothing was stolen or hacked.  Republican senators should not continue to surrender their words to those with malign intent."
SenGraham asks #Kavanaugh - are there any words in the Constitution about abortion?  What are the limits on the ability of any court to find a "penumbra of rights" for any situation?  (law school drinking game - don't get it twisted - I was drinking Ben&amp;Jerrys)
BREAKING:  Per Fox's @jason_donner SenBooker says he doesn't think SenCornyn will pursue action against him for releasing "Committee Confidential" documents - "I think he was just like a lot of bullies are, a lot of talk and no action."
SenGraham says some are calling this #Kavanaugh hearing a circus - says he wants to defend circuses - those are fun and you can take your kids.
SenLeahy invokes the "I was born at night, but not last night" line to #Kavanaugh
SenBooker has released 4 documents that were id'd as "committee confidential" - trying to clarify with his office whether that label has been removed or whether he's following through on his threat to violate policy - and that they still remain classified that way.  #Kavanaugh
Protester screams something to the effect "you're overseeing the death of the Republic!"  #civics #notademocracy
Man screams "Save Democracy!  Save Roe!" as he's dragged out, taking down several chairs (and at least one other person I could see) to the ground.
Protester screaming about "millions of Americans who've died without healthcare" and then repeatedly screams "SHAME!" as she's dragged out... #KavanaughHearing
SenTillis says - ok - let's waive the rules and all agree we'll let all our emails about the Kavanaugh process go public.  Wouldn't that make sense to expose all that info to the American people?
SenTillis says - I hope everyone will record transcript of what's going on right now.  Are we making Senate an untrustworthy body to process sensitive documents?  You'll rue that day if that's what we're doing.
SenLee says - we don't own these documents.  We have to go through a process based on a law WE passed.  Let's go through the steps.  We can make this work - we've been doing that.
SenLee says - this privilege thing is real.  This isn't our privilege.  This is a presidential privilege.
SenBlumenthal asks "What are they concealing?  What are they afraid the American people would see?"
SenBooker says this is closest I'll get to my "I am Spartacus" moment - I'm knowingly violating policy - and to SenCornyn - bring it on.  If you think I'm really breaking a Senate rule - I hope you'll bring charges against me - also against Durbin, Coons, Whitehouse, Hirono, etal
SenKlobuchar - by ram-rodding this through for political reason - we're denying the public to see documents.  #Kavanaugh
SenKlobuchar says - as we've pointed out - with late document dump - there's no way to adequately review them.  We're going to wind up finding documents we want to make public - no time.  This hearing is being "ram-rodded through".
SenCornyn says there was a person to sift through documents on behalf of former PresClinton when JusticeKagan was nominated (b/c of her time w/i Clinton administration).  Says this is no different.
SenDurbin calls out SenCornyn for calling out SenBooker ...
SenDurbin throws out Steve Bannon's name - "a man I cannot describe in a few words."  2nd day of #Kavanaugh question still hasn't started.
SenDurbin says - the authority we've given to the man vetting Bush43 documents to assert Bush's presidential privilege is ridiculous, asks - who is this man to keep these documents from the American people? Again, SenCornyn said Senate has no authority to ignore pres. privilege.
SenFeinstein says 99% of Justice Kagan's White House records were available for anyone to see.  We only have 4% of Kavanaugh's WH records.
SenFeinstein says - JudiciaryCommittee doesn't have any standing rules on how/when docs are labeled "committee confidential" - This is w/o precedent.
SenLee says:  we have documents that are subject to any number of privileges.  We've got an accommodation for the Committee - ways we can clear documents.  It worked here.  We should move forward.
SenLee says when this happened last night I was concerned as I would be in any court - not fair to question a witness about a document he can't even see.  I offered to SenBooker to release the doc with help of staff.  That's happening - the process worked.  We can do this.
SenBlumenthal says he reserves right to release any documents he feels are appropriate before final vote on Kavanaugh.  Says all Senators should.
ChairGrassley says many of the sensitive documents being cleared are going through DOJ - says people there are long time employees who have "worked through multiple administrations" and expects they are nonpartisan.
SenBlumenthal says - we're in uncharted territory - the "process has broken down."  "All these documents belong to the people of the United States."  "Shame on my colleagues if they conceal them now."  Cornyn noted that the Senate cannot ignore privilege claimed by PresBush.
SenKennedy notes he was chairing the committee last night - gave SenBooker "some leeway" - and gave #Kavanaugh time to reply.  I was trying to be fair to both sides...
SenWhitehouse says I want to make clear I don't accept the legitimacy or validity of the process of releasing "committee confidential" documents - so I'm not bound by the rules.
#KavanaughHearing off to a rocky start this morning with numerous Dem Senators on Judiciary Comm objecting.  Grassley says "we can stay here until midnight."
BREAKING:  SenBooker says he knows he is violating Senate rules by releasing a sensitive email in #Kavanaugh hearing.  Booker calls it civil disobedience and is prepared to get kicked out of the Senate.  SenCornyn asks him to reconsider "irresponsible conduct unbecoming a Sen"
Protesters have “taken over” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen @ChuckGrassley office - saying they’ll stay until #Kavanaugh hearing is shut down.  Hearing is underway. Photo by @lilwil7 https://t.co/Mj80eGqmTr
Doing final book edits at the same time I'm covering a SCOTUS hearing from 9am to midnight all week:

Big thank you to @SenatorCardin for stopping by to talk about Dem positions on #Kavanaugh Watch tonight 11p @foxnewsnight @FoxNews https://t.co/4NmM5GHzI5
"Religious whack-job" AND "floozie"??  Wow - that's quite a combo 🤔 https://t.co/AsmVz9ETOr
I'm in nerd paradise.  @SenMikeLee asks #Kavanaugh what his fave Federalist Paper is.  Who knew this hearing would get so Sophie's Choice??
Every night at 11pm - for as long as it takes!  Senators Cardin, Hatch and Lee scheduled to join us tonight @FoxNews @FoxNewsNight #KavanaughHearing https://t.co/Ju4tfkq7dE
!! #KavanaughHearing was scheduled to go until roughly 9:30pm https://t.co/3oOecIQnjZ
SenLeahy asks when you were in the WH did you work with John Yoo on ANY warrantless surveillance.  Kavanaugh says - can't rule that out, so much happening in the days/months after 9/11/01
ChairGrassley re: video SenLeahy played -  in 15 SCOTUS hearings I've been a part of - never seen a video like that used before - I will insist Kavanaugh has chance to put this in context
ChairGrassley to SenLeahy - If you were interested in the material you're talking about - it's been available for weeks
ChairGrassley raising his voice a bit with SenLeahy - dust up over material from Kavanaugh WH years
It’s freezing in the #KavanaughHearing - @lilwil7 came prepared (obvi - she’s the most organized human I know) #blankie #brrrrr https://t.co/AdKsA7dpUr
SenLeahy asking Kavanaugh about a draft Dem letter that "ended up in your inbox."  "You didn't realize what you had was a stolen letter signed by me?"
Ok - took a little break to do radio with @kilmeade and @BillHemmer - Done with those jokers, now back to #Kavanaugh
Kavanaugh says:  limited contact and communication with Judge Kozinski over the years - knew "nothing" about the allegations before they became public.  When I heard it, it was "a gut punch."  Hatch says it was for him too.  Kavanaugh says he was disappointed and shocked.
Kavanaugh clerked for former 9th Cir Judge Kozinski - who resigned last year following numerous allegations of inappropriate conduct, sex harassment.  SenHatch brings it up before left gets to - giving Kavanaugh a chance to respond to "guilt by association" allegations.
Kavanaugh says:  I was not read into or part of crafting legal justifications for post 9/11 interrogation issues - was not involved
SenHatch up now - cites glowing praise for #Kavanaugh  ... from liberals
SenFeinstein to Kavanaugh - You're becoming very good at filibustering
Kavanaugh says:  I've been asked what changed my views about investigations for sitting presidents.  9/11 is what changed it for me.  I thought very deeply about seeing PresBush on 9/12/01 - single-minded focus.
Kavanaugh says:  After the Ken Starr investigation, I went to work in the WH for several years.  Years later I wrote about/reflected on what I'd learned.
SenFeinstein moves on to issue of presidential power - refers to Kavanaugh's time on Ken Starr team
Feinstein again pushes Kavanaugh about whether his view on Roe has changed since he was in Bush43 WH.  Clear she's getting at something they believe they have indicating his feelings on Roe back in those days.  He says - let me be clear on how I view Roe right now.
Kavanaugh says:  I don't live in a bubble.  I understand the importance of the issue (abortion).
Feinstein says "I don't want to go back to those death tolls" (from illegal abortions)  Says Kavanaugh explanation is important to her decision about how to vote for him.
SenFeinstein asks Kavanaugh - What do you mean that Roe is "settled law"?  Do you believe it could be overturned?  Have your views changed since you worked in Bush43 WH?
SenFeinstein says up to 1M died from illegal abortions in US pre-Roe (believe that's the time period she cited)
Kavanaugh outlines holding of Roe and progeny - abortion pre-viability, with other key guidelines
Feinstein asks:  do you agree that women's control over her reproductive rights impacts her economic position (paraphrase)
Kavanaugh says:  as a judge - my job was to follow 2A of SCOTUS whether I agreed with it or not (re: guns)
Kavanaugh says:  handguns are used in lots of crimes that result in death, so are semi-automatic rifles  -  people also use for hunting and self-defense
Kavanaugh says:  Even at my girls' school they're doing things differently to try to make things more safe.
Feinstein asks:  How do you reconcile your position with "hundreds" of school shootings with these weapons?
Feinstein says - your position is that it's unconstitutional to ban assault weapons?  Kavanaugh says - was adhering to SCOTUS precedent, regardless of whether I agree or not.
Kavanaugh says:  most people don't realize most handguns are semi-automatic,  and semi-automatic rifles are widely possessed in the US - millions of them.  Feinstein says - you're basing common use on number?  That's not same as "widely used".  Kav response - they are widely used
Kavanaugh says:  In Heller, SCOTUS struck down ban on handguns - most are semi-automatic (Feinstein breaks in - I think we're on different topics)  Kavanaugh again cites Scalia's Heller opinion
Kavanaugh speaking on his dissent in Heller II - tells SenFeinstein he was following SupCt precedent
SenFeinstein now starting questioning - beginning with gun laws #KavanaughHearings
Kavanaugh says:  I've studied previous hearings - how nominees have answered - cites Justices Ginsburg/Kagan about not giving clues about how they will rule on an issue that could come before the SupCt
Kavanaugh says:  I always ask myself - how's it been done before - as a judge that means precedent
Kavanaugh says:  judge doesn't bounce around thinking about what's best - no, they adhere to precedent
Kavanaugh says:  my personal opinions have nothing to do with judicial decisions
Protests haven't slowed at all. We all discussed this morning whether that had been exhausted yesterday.  Clearly not.  Latest chant:  "No Trump puppet!"  Grassley and Kavanaugh continue not to acknowledge -
Kavanaugh says: No one asked me to guarantee I'd vote a specific way in any case - including Roe
Protester yelling "Save Roe!  Vote No!"
Protesters yelling "This is a democracy!"  and calling someone (unclear) "a criminal"
Kavanaugh says:  "If you walk into my courtroom and you have the better legal arguments, you will win."
ChairGrassley says  - Fine, let these protesters have their free speech - if they want to keep interrupting the other 300 million people trying to hear from you ...
Protesters are quickly removed, #Kavanaugh keeps talking - but every interruption takes several seconds.  ie, I don't think we're going to wrap on time...
Protester screams:  "You are gaslighting the American people!" - Larger group this time, very loud - #Kavanaugh keeps talking
Kavanaugh says:  Equal justice under the law for everyone #KavanaughHearing
Kavanaugh says:  We are not to be influenced by executive or legislative branch #KavanaughHearing
Kavanaugh says:  Executive Branch is subject to the law and court system - impt part of our constitutional structure
Kavanaugh says: "no one is above the law in our Constitutional system"
First time Kavanaugh speaks - a protester instantly interrupts https://t.co/zuaGY6uP9m
Protesters continue to pipe up - but seems they are quickly removed and neither Grassley nor #Kavanaugh is acknowledging them at this point
Ok @lilwil and I look like crazy stalkers - but such a treat to meet the Senator today (finally!) #Kavanaugh https://t.co/mfXVv1qHme
Kavanaugh says - I always want the losing party to say - "Kavanaugh gave me a fair shake" - want both sides to say "he had an open mind"
Kavanaugh - as he mentions civility, another protester erupts - he continues
Kavanaugh says:  being a good job also includes human qualities - I'm joining a team of 9 if I'm confirmed - I don't make decisions by myself - learn from each other when deciding cases - work together - collegiality, civility
Right off the top - protesting begins #KavanaughHearing Day 2. https://t.co/eZ11HWbPgm
Kavanaugh says:  good judge pays attention to the words as they're written - the law - the Constitution
Kavanaugh says - Important for judges to be independent, to have a backbone
Protester now yelling about Merrick Garland
Protester screaming “We are not working with Democrats!  We’re doing this for ourselves!”  ChairGrassley proceeds ...
Aaaaaaaaand we have our first group protest. Screaming “Mother Earth” and “Sham President”
Day 2: Judge #Kavanaugh has been seated - let the questioning begin! https://t.co/mSAeuQoCHu
Getting ready for day 2 of #KavanaughHearing - coffee was a must this morning! https://t.co/QNfH9Ko9h2

Did you miss the #KavanaughHearing today? We’ve got you covered on all the ins and outs - 11p ET @FoxNewsNight @FoxNews! https://t.co/yflVqgBxNp
Trying to be diplomatic so we can leave the door open. Always think it serves our viewers best to hear both sides.  He and his staffers know who they are. We’ll try again tomorrow. https://t.co/xQEc4NFAjg
Our team spent weeks inviting Dem senators to be part of our Kavanaugh coverage this week.  One eventually agreed to tonight - and just cancelled.  I honestly thought they'd welcome the opportunity to voice their objections to Kavanaugh and the process.  Oh well - invite stands.
Kavanaugh says:  I've handled more than 2,000 cases.  I've given it my all in every case.  I'm proud of my body of work.  I tell people, "Don't read about my judicial opinions.  READ my judicial opinions."
Kavanaugh says:  My Mom always said use your common sense.  Taught me good judges stand in the shoes of others.
Kavanaugh says:  My Mom started as a public school teacher in DC.  She taught me importance of equal rights/justice/dignity for all.  When I was 10 she went to law school and b/c a prosecutor - practiced her closing arguments on my Dad and me.
Kavanaugh says:  To sum up Justice Kennedy's legacy in one word - liberty.
Kavanaugh says:  I thank the President for this honor.  I'm very grateful for his courtesy.  Press and Mrs. Trump were very kind to my family on the night I was announced.  My daughter refers to it as her debut on national tv.  (room laughs)
Kavanaugh says:  I have met with 65 senators, including almost every member of this committee.  They've been substantive and personal discussions.  Greatly enjoyed all 65 meetings.  I've learned by listening to you - about this country and the people you represent.
Judge Kavanaugh about to give his opening statement.  #SCOTUS
Standing just above where the public is sitting @lilwil7 and I have gotten pretty good and looking down and predicting which ones are going to be protesters...
SenKennedy says he wants a Justice to protect the Constitution and Bill of Rights (“it’s not a la carte”) AND who knows how to properly use a semicolon.  #KavanaughHearing
Latest protester screams, “Stop the oppression of women!” Removed from room.
SenBlumenthal tells #Kavanaugh there will always be an asterisk by his name bc he’s nominated “by an unindicted co-conspirator”.  Joins SenCoons in asking #Kavanaugh himself to stop the hearing.
SenBlumenthal says he plans to ask #Kavanagh - “Do you think Roe was correctly decided?”
Protester yells, “Motion to Adjourn!”  Don’t think it works that way, but ...
I always found @SenJonKyl to be a straightforward guy, with plenty of respect on both sides of the aisle.
Newest protester:  “This is what democracy looks like.”  #KavanaughHearing
Protesters yelling that “women will be sent to back alley abortions” if #Kavanaugh could firmed.
Most definitely the primary Dem objection this morning - https://t.co/QSMalVhLo8
SenFeinstein expresses concerns to #Kavanagh re: abortion, guns, time working in Bush43 White House.
This hearing room has lots of 2020 feels. #KavanaughHearing
SenBlumenthal again moves to adjourn. SenGrassley:  denied. Now SenHirono interrupting.
SenGrassley seems he’s reaching the end of his patience.  Asks Dems: “How long do you want to go on?”
Judge Kavanaugh’s children just left the hearing room with escorts.
SenCornyn says - we have rules, decorum. Every Senator will have a chance to speak.  Hard to take seriously Dems claims “they can’t do their job” when most made up their minds before the hearing. #KavanaughHearing
Protests continue erupting. You get the picture.  Nothing has returned to regular order.  Not sure when Grassley is going to wrap up letting Dems air their grievances. He’s indicated he thinks it’s best to let everyone get their say and - at some point - move on.
10:19am ET - protests continue and opening statements have yet to start https://t.co/rpwOOdmkpn
SenGrassley says he’s got patience, is letting people speak so “we can proceed peacefully”. #KavanaughHearing
Silent protests outside the #KavanaughHearing this morning https://t.co/nd9qNuogNw
SenGrassley says I don’t have to explain to you that this is out of order.  Another round of multiple protesters erupts.
The original group of protestors at the #KavanaughHearing https://t.co/p6M95Ynlzb
SenFeinstein says country is deeply divided, now outlining “corruption, scandal” in Trump administration.
SenGrassley says we’ll stay here as long as it takes if Dems want to argue.  Hearing scheduled tomorrow wrap Friday. Grassley says - fine we’ll work through Saturday, Sunday, as long as it takes for the disruptions.
SenBlumenthal again asks ChairmanGrassley to adjourn #KavanaughHearing SenBooker supports motion
The video is coming. You’ll see with your own eyes. #standby Several single protesters too. https://t.co/iVmUW8aLoF
protests continue https://t.co/t0fX4TSWue
more protests #KavanaughHearing https://t.co/XBPtNHzv4y
8th protester group now yelling #KavanaughHearing
7th protester now up #KavanaughHearing
6th protester outburst #KavanaughHearing
5th protester outburst #KavanaughHearing
Now a 4th set of protesters. #KavanaughHearing
This is the 4th SCOTUS confirmation hearing I’ve covered. This is easily most raucous. And now a third group of protesters.
SenBooker now interrupts SenGrassley. New round of protesters loudly disrupting.  #KavanaughHearing
Sens Harris, Klobuchar, Blumenthal interrupt Chairman Grassley opening statement.  Blumenthal calls to adjourn. Lots of loud protesters now screaming.

I’m genuinely glad you felt safe. It was a rowdy night out there. I’ve done many a liveshot in the midst #SCOTUS protests, but our team was put in a situation that made us uneasy.

SenSchumer on Senate floor says all nominees claim they'll respect precedent and Senators just nod, but there are numerous examples of judges who reversed their position once on the bench.  #SCOTUS
SenSchumer on Senate floor says key rights are gravely under threat - based on list of #SCOTUS candidates.
SenSchumer on Senate floor says:  The President has gone to two far out of the mainstream groups and asked them - not the Senate - to do the advise and consent function.
SenSchumer on Senate floor says - "America is on tenterhooks, so worried about any choice from this list." #SCOTUS
SenSchumer speaking on Senate floor now - ripping Leonard Leo and list of #SCOTUS candidates. Says Leo has spent his life trying to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Chief Justice always votes, unless he's had to recuse from the case for some reason (rare).  #SCOTUS https://t.co/lJ2hbGQeq3
They never tell us which opinions are coming, but the next scheduled opinion day is Monday the 11th.  Stand by! https://t.co/1nQytM23h7
Correct, J.Ginsburg also wrote:  "The fact that Philips might sell other cakes and cookies to gay and lesbian customers was irrelevant to the issue [in this case]." https://t.co/FjHaRvP1F8
NOTE:  The Justices could vote as soon as Thurs on whether they'll hear the case of a Washington florist who declined when a longtime customer asked her to do flowers for his same-sex ceremony.  I suspect J.Kennedy would like to stick around if they vote "yes"
J.Ginsburg (dissenting): " I see no reason why the comments of one or two Commissioners should be taken to overcome Phillips’ refusal to sell a wedding cake to Craig and Mullins." #SCOTUS #Masterpiece
J.Kennedy: "When it comes to weddings, it can be assumed that a member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral and religious grounds could not be compelled to perform the ceremony without denial of his or her right to the free exercise of religion" #SCOTUS #Masterpiece
If you feel strongly on EITHER side of this case I'd urge you to read the opinion for yourself.  It's much more than a quick headline:   https://t.co/hj5BJdSSKo
Key to Masterpiece opinion - Majority felt anti-religious comments by Commissioners who first heard the case were "inappropriate for a Commission charged with the solemn responsibility of fair and neutral enforcement" of Colorado law.  #SCOTUS

My understanding of the proposed reg is that drs can give patients data/facts/counseling on abortion.

Just out of SCOTUS. J. Sotomayor asked what gives Pres @realDonaldTrump power to go beyond what Congress has done on immigration.

SecDef says:  We urge responsible nations to condemn the Assad regime.
SecDef says:  We have gone to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties.
SecDef says:  Clearly the Assad regime did not get the message last time.
SecDef says:  US has interest in deterring the use of chemical weapons.
Pres says:  We pray God will watch over and bless the United States of America.
Pres says:  I ask Americans to pray for our noble warriors and those of our allies.
Pres says:  The US will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people.
Pres says:  American does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria - "under no circumstances."  We look forward to the day we can bring our warriors home - and great warriors they are.  We cannot purge the world of evil or act everywhere there is tyranny.
Pres says:  Maybe one day we'll be friends with Russia/Iran
Pres says:  In 2013 Putin promised world they'd guarantee elimination of Syria's chem weapons.  What's happened is direct failure of Russia to keep that promise.  Russia must decide if it will now join with civilized nations for stability and peace.
Pres says:  I have message for Russia/Iran - "What kind of a nation wants to be associated with a mass murder of innocent men, women and children?"
Pres says: Chem weapons are uniquely dangerous.  Even small amounts unleash widespread devastation.
Pres says:  These are crimes of a monster.  #Syria
Pres says:  Last Saturday Assad regime used chem weapons to slaughter innocents.  It was a significant escalation in a pattern of  chem weapons use.
Pres says:  Short time ago I ordered US forces to launch operation with France/UK in response to chemical weapons attack in Syria - now underway "We thank them both" https://t.co/VvwewTdXyY

Does any of this jumpstart the conversation about FISA Courts operating ex parte?
Full House Intel memo to be posted here "shortly"   https://t.co/6DshXapQsI
Per @ByronYork "DOJ official Bruce Ohr met with Steele beginning in the summer of 2016 and relayed to DOJ information about Steele's bias. Steele told Ohr that he, Steele, was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected president and was passionate about him not becoming pres."
Per @ByronYork "The political origins of the Steele dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials, but excluded from the FISA applications."
Per @ByronYork "Andrew McCabe confirmed that no FISA warrant would have been sought from the FISA Court without the Steele dossier information."
Per @ByronYork "The Steele dossier formed an essential part of the initial and all three renewal FISA applications against Carter Page."

Per Fox's @ChadPergram - Five GOP NO votes on moving forward on House-passed short-term funding measure:  Flake, Graham, Lee, Paul and McConnell. BUT McConnell's NO vote is ONLY a procedural move - allows him to re-open the vote and try again if he wishes.
Per Fox's @ChadPergram - five Dems voted YES to move forward on House-passed short-term funding measure:  Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin, Jones, McCaskill
