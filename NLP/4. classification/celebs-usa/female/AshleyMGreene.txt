@riiileekeeoh on the @RogueAudience #RogueTV set, it was probably the first time i worked with @Richard_Schiff and @colehauser
@ash_greeneorg probably how fearless she is.
@riiileekeeoh meaning while I was on the #RogueTV set? or in general?
@greenemydiva @RogueAudience The end is pretty killer....
@femmerebbel @RogueAudience @deadpoolmovie and I loved it enough to see it twice! If you're into perfect comedic timing, watch it!

@TheTobimeister I intend to :)
@femmerebbel @RogueAudience I would say that they both have something mysterious about them. They're both capable of more than ppl think
@greenemydiva @RogueAudience It depends on the scene, but music is a very powerful medium.
@IbelieveKellash My favorite thing about Mia is probably her perseverance
@ash_greeneorg I wish I could have kept some of the more dangerous items :) but no luck. I got a great leather jacket though!
@RogueAudience is airing now! Let me know your thoughts or questions!
@IbelieveKellash @umaReaser of course! i love when I get to interact with fans! You guys are incredible!!

Terrifying. Elevated. Dark. #TheApparition
RT @x3itshayley: @AshleyMGreene #AskAshleyGreene can you describe the movie in 3 words ?? :D #TheApparition
Alice! She's extremely fashionable, loyal, and she could definitely protect me from bad guys.
RT @krinapatel_: if you could be friends with any of the characters you've played, who would it be and why? :) #AskAshleyGreene x
Billy Madison. My mom had to hide the tape from my brother and I because we watched it over and over and over again.
RT @ZahraBlack94: @AshleyMGreene what's your favourite comedy movie? #AskAshleyGreene
A hummingbird :)
RT @FuckYesKS: @AshleyMGreene If you could be an animal by choice, what would you be? A bat? #askashleygreene
I think we are both pretty proactive and have strong personalities. She's also an animal lover like me :)
RT @Meriem4JH: @AshleyMGreene Are there any similarities between yourself and Kelly? #AskAshleyGreene :)
Marlo.... not so much. Theo on the other hand thinks he is 10 feet tall.... great guard dog.
RT @CandyAshKrisJen: Would Marlo make a good companion for apparition hunting, or does she get scared easily? #AskAshleyGreene
Probably the hotel scene. I got a little claustrophobic .
RT @mddeese: @AshleyMGreene Wht was the scariest scene u filmed? #AskAshleyGreene #TheApparition
Audrey Hepburn.
RT @mddeese: @AshleyMGreene Ur favorite actors or actresses? #AskAshleyGreene
Being physically and mentally exhausted for three months.....
RT @IHeartJWhitlock: @AshleyMGreene What was the hardest part of filming #TheApparition? #AskAshleyGreene
Will Ferrell....hands down
RT @CityOfAshleyG: @AshleyMGreene If you could be anyone for just a day, who would it be and why? #AskAshleyGreene :)
Probably "The Shining" or "The Strangers" Both terrifying.
RT @mizzzezzbieber: @AshleyMGreene All time favorite scary movie? #AskAshleyGreene
I liked the fact that the character of Kelly was a smart strong woman. The film is scary on a psychological level and I really liked that.
RT @missstarlightx:  Why did you choose this role in the first place? How was the process to get it? #AskAshleyGreene #TheApparition
Right now my focus is on acting and taking on new challenging roles, but I do love fashion, so maybe one day.
RT @MiniAliceGreene: #AskAshleyGreene @AshleyMGreene would you ever want to create your own fashion line? That would be AWESOME :D
Being able to portray  a character that I loved so much and having the support of all the amazing fans :)
RT @GabbyMcleod: #AskAshleyGreene what was your favorite part of being in twilight?
The unknown.
RT @BethanyCullen_: #AskAshleyGreene @AshleyMGreene what's your biggest fear ?
Exploring different emotions and situations. I'd never done a film this dark. It was definitely a challenge and I'm proud that I did it.
RT @AnnalisaJukebox: @AshleyMGreene #AskAshleyGreene What did you like the most filming The Apparition? :)
I try not to think too in depth about all of that stuff... but I definitely don't rule it out.
RT @BMcAllistercKy: Do you personally believe in the paranormal and if so, any personal ghost stories? #AskAshleyGreene #THEAPPARITION
Ready to start answering your questions - fire away! :) #AskAshleyGreene
