@LukeBroadlick Lol stop😂
Don’t see the miracles.. it’s okay they are coming.
The enemy will make you argue with your spouse on the way to church.. and the Lord can make you kiss one another leaving.. That is the power of God.
If you fell.. just get back up. Don’t over think.. don’t look back.. just get back up.

Oh London how I have missed you! ❤️
You need your fire back!
Fire! Jeremiah 20:9
Had a dream..    God told me to read Galatians.
God will not give up on me.. and God will not give up on you.
Just because you messed up doesn’t mean you can’t get up and keep going.. we all have done things we said we wouldn’t.. even when you are trying to follow Christ. Just repent and keep going ❤️  The Battle Isn’t Over
GOD is reachable ❤️
The enemy wants you to feel that God is unreachable.
If the devil tried to tempt Jesus.. the devil will try to tempt you. Stay on the straight and narrow.
Learn to seek God
Trust. Believe. Have Faith
Stay Focused
What I’m working on this week.. Self Control😊

New Blog Post! Sharing my skin care goodies! https://t.co/Bxo0KG6JlP
Conviction is a good thing.
Not everyone is called to be a beauty blogger.. find your purpose! Submit yourself under God.
I encourage everyone to marry someone you can pray with. I’ve never had a relationship with so much meaning in my life. I love that I can pray with my husband.
Don’t be in the lazy spiritually
Get Up and March Forward
Your never going to sleep your way to your destiny.
“The Lord is going to fight for you and your going to hold your peace”
“You’ve got to get into a position and a posture to hear from God”
Friendly reminder ❤️
Timing is everything! Everything will come to pass that is for you.
Don’t rush your career!
Don’t rush to have kids!
Don’t rush to get married.
Life isn’t a race!
Don’t be deceived the grass isn’t greener on the other side.
All this free time what are you going to do with it.
What are you going to do to prepare?
I want to be used by God.
Don’t count on the devil giving up
I’m on the right path
The sword of the spirit is the word of God.
Did you know God didn’t have to give us his name?
Having a breakthrough this morning!
Your going to feel uncomfortable if you want to grow!

Not gonna lie.. sometimes L.A I love y’alls laundry mats 💕
Get over your fears!
It’s not you that will move your mountain .. it’s your faith that will.
Start operating in the realm of faith!
It’s not on your time..  it’s on Jesus time.
All things are possible to them that believe!
God responds to faith!
Push Through
Faith Finds A Way
Am I Putting Limits On Jesus?
I’m obsessed with my husband
Thank God for gut feelings
Got the weirdest vibe..  making my circle a bit smaller ❤️

Becoming a Doer Will Change Your Life.
Get to know God.

Embrace the Process.
You can hear from God any time of the day.
Packing for Los Angeles ❤️

Coming back to London this year! Super Excited ❤️❤️
Prayed with my parents last night and it was amazing! I encourage you when you can pray with your parents it makes your bond even stronger!

Matthew 25:3-9  Lord you are a great God
I finished.. and felt like I could run even longer.
He told me while I was running.. you have enough oil.. you have enough oil. And if you continue to seek after me you will always have oil.. more than enough.
And it did! He told me.. your going to finish keep going. But it was burning and I just wanted to stop.. but hearing God made me not give up.
So today while running. I was on my last minute. God told me this going to feel like the longest minute of your life.
When I workout I talk to God.
Make sure your routine everyday is a routine that makes you stronger mentally and physically.
Make sure you pray it is important. How many prayers are in the Bible?
If you find yourself in the waiting zone use that time to work on yourself.. educate yourself.. you are  in the waiting zone for a reason.. so the next season you are ready.
The world may look good but it’s filled with evil.
The Lord dwells in humility.
You’ve got to get your self control back again
Stop trying to learn the hard way.
His mercies are new everyday!

One at a time.
Don’t make decisions based on fear.
What you think.. is what you will become.. Reset your mind.. SPEAK out into the atmosphere positive things to enter into your life!
Stepping out on faith.. is hard.. but what would life be if you knew every single outcome. Take a chance and lean on God. He will look out for you more than you can try to look out for yourself.

Remember those days baby when we were both on our knees in our studio apartment.. praying for the things that we have today @LukeBroadlick
Remember those days baby when just your laughter and us making music together in the apartment.. and bible study’s about God was all our days consisted of.@LukeBroadlick
Remember those days baby when Id wake up in the morning to flowers in the wine bottles we had drank together.. cause red wine educated conversation and sweet music go hand in hand.. and flowers were just a sweet touch to your romance
Remember those days baby when our children were in our dreams and we were just excited to wake up to see each other’s face and say your real .. @LukeBroadlick
Remember those days baby.. when we would chase the sun down to make sure we would get a chance to stare at the stars.. drink wine together and laugh at our imperfections. @LukeBroadlick

Good night all.   Love.
Big thank you to everyone for following me and reading these tweets!  Be sure to never go to sleep angry. And Praise God if you see tomorrow
Encouraging others if you want something or an answer from God.. Look into fasting in the scripture.. It will change your life
And God pushed me to a place I didn't think or know I could go
I know you guys are going to think I'm crazy but just last month I realized what true fasting was.. It amazed me..
When you are still you can hear from God very clearly
Right now.. I'm learning to be still.. And if you know me.. You know this is extremely hard for me..
I'd rather be cool with God
I've had to learn and still learning that you must stay on the straight and narrow.. People are going to think your uncool.. Whatever..
My voice will be heard.. And my ear will be at the mouth piece of God.
I've been silent lately.. The enemy has been attacking me in ways if you aren't a believer you wouldn't understand.. So I'll just say this.
That took growth.. Cause the old me would have been envious of things that weren't even for me.
I love to see people do great things.. It makes me happy to see others happy..
On my heart.. Always stick to your gut.. You ever know what it is going to get you out of.. Or bring to you.
It's crazy how the enemy tries to hide the amazing stuff that God has for you.
The package I finally received were books.. And man oh man were they hard to find..
Embrace growth.. Heal.. Protect.. Demonstrate.. Be passionate.. Strong.. Happy
I stay inspired.. I stay influenced.. By those who not only want to be better.. But their actions are better..
Communication and Conversation hasn't ceased you just have to find and know the right people to keep around you.
Up late thinking about how some want materialistic items.. And some want knowledge.. They are two totally different mindsets.
Baby sleep.. And I finally got my package I was waiting for! ❤️😍😍😍❤️ happy day!
@RalphCo11ins 🙂 hope your doing well

Dear @LukeBroadlick  I love you
Remember we are strong.  Our ancestors taught us that.
Please Lord don't let the evil in this world harden the hearts that love you.
We need you Jesus guide our steps and please send your Holy Spirit to those who need your comfort!
Without prayer and just action we go on our own understanding.
Ask Jesus for answers of what to do next!
First! We need to pray! Ask Jesus for his help and protection!
Everybody is wondering what are we going to do. As black people what do we do!
Praying for the innocent.

@kenraggiocom I thank Jesus Christ for you.. The truth cuts deep
@kenraggiocom every time I retweet you.. My followers don't speak to me.. If I tweeted about new music hundreds would respond..
I'd rather be hated for what I believe in than loved for my iniquities.
You can clearly see that the truth makes people feel uncomfortable ❤️
Love your enemies 😊
@MeganeiraM are you okay Hun? If you want to talk about any of your issues I'll be there.. Hope you have a blessed day 😊

You just think you do
A lot of y'all don't even know what love really means.
Love early mornings.. Love late nights.. Love life 😊
Nothing has any hold on you.. Once you have asked God for forgiveness.. Forgiven yourself.. And turned from your old ways.

Come on.. When are you going to have both feet with Jesus? Instead of one foot in and one foot focusing on what others are doing.
Change your routine.. Try waking up praying and then reading a scripture.. Peaceful start❤️
You're right no one is better than another.. But there are better choices than other choices you could be choosing.
@_MandaaaS awesome! Send verses my way... Would love to read them anytime😊
Main fruit..  Obedient to the word of God. (Faithfulness)
Fruit of the spirit - " Love, Joy, Peace,Patience,Kindness,Goodness,Faithfullness,Gentleness, and Self-Control" - Galatians 5:22-23
Once God reveals the truth of that persons fruits to you.. The bible says Just keep loving them and also keep seeking him for more truth
If someone claims to be Christian the bible tells us to look at their fruits.. that is how to tell the real from the fakes..
We have so many distractions.. For many of us we can't focus at one thing at a time..  Keep your priorities in order
The closer you get to God.. The less you'll want from what the world is trying to sell you.
Remember to always to say positive words in the atmosphere.
Love yourself first.. Then you'll know how to love others
Love what God gave you.. It gives you a type of strength no one can take away from you.
Storm Ravaged Faith  Luke 8:22-25   The Miracles of Jesus in Luke-Chap.4 to Chap.7   Storms will reveal your faith http://t.co/Vc1gyvvJsN
Can't wait to be fed by the word of God.. 🚙 church here we come!
Get a goal.. And go after it!
Someone asked me "what's in your makeup bag." 😂 As of right now.. Just moisturizer 😎
Let's both wear denim and hang out at the beach 😏
True. No one is perfect. But that's not going to stop me from being the best person I can be.
The love you guys show.. Gives me joy! Thank you guys 😍
@officialcefi followed! Your so sweet
@__Vante__ ugh! I'm so sorry! Happy belated birthday my love! I really hope it was amazing😉
Hello Twitter baby!
I've missed you instababy 😏 https://t.co/PXTzpBWLh3
Wish love to people.. Wish people success in happiness. That's the goal right?
Never compare your life.. Your life is unique beautiful things happen to everyone.. Nothing happens to everyone the same way 😏
Never compare your life to  someone else's life.. You will be miserable.
What God has for you.. It is for you.
My man has never been the type to stay behind a star.. He is a star 😎
I would be a fool if I would ever argue with a fool
In the eyes of God
I'm starting to think some of us are just trying to be beautiful all the time like the Egyptians.. Smh we know what happened to them.
The people that make time for you.. Are the ones that love you.
His Hand kisses😍

World we need more love
Mine 😏 @lukebroadlick https://t.co/YUiNwxOTn1
I'm not perfect.. The key is to learn from your mistakes..  And DONT LOOK BACK.. JESUS always has better right in front of you.
My faith can not be broken.. I have felt God pick me up while I was broken and restore me.
We are in the generation where people are confused on what is right from wrong.. And suddenly bad is now good. Be careful know yourself.
Stay sober.. Be watchful
I just don't understand
It just seems like the more money you have the more you want to be entertained.. What about helping more people than helping yourself
I just don't understand.
We have cooking competitions while kids go hungry.
Don't you guys think it's weird that some of us have more than enough clothes while some don't have any.
Why so serious.. Because it seems like no one else can be.
@jaetok nothing but love 😊
I believe it's extremely dangerous when you can't see the struggle.. That means struggle may be beyond physicality
People keep telling me how great it is to grow up in such an era.. And I don't agree.
@jaetok then try hard not to lust after her. Stay strong in the faith. Follow God he will lead you.
@jaetok Is she your wife?
I know I'm not tweeting what's popular to read.. But it's something you need to hear
Women of God try hard to love God more than you love your body.. Respect your temple.
Men of God try hard not to lust after women
Stay strong Christians stay strong
Everyone is beautiful OKAY!
No matter what the color of the sky is I'm always loving you https://t.co/vspxfoebDN

Last but not least Your Love , when you figure out what you want and who you are.. This is the love that makes you the happiest.
Your real love .. Most of the time that's the one that hurts the most.
Your first love .. Excited and eager but  doesnt pan out the way you imagined.
I believe there are three types of pure love you  can experience in your life..

Never judge the one you don't understand. Cause you too could be misunderstood.
Spending time with mom❤
They say I have expensive taste because I have big dreams! Oh well
Let me be the legend in your life that you tell your children. Let me be the girl that showed you what real love feels like.
Leave me in this room in the dark &amp; I swear when you come back the room will be so bright you will need those shades you wear in a dark room
I can't afford your love..  *empty pockets* but what I do have is a strong enough heart to pick up your happy off of the ground
I'm not afraid to say that I can be fragile.. I'm not afraid to say I'm simple.. I'm not afraid to admit that I am everything you are not.
I'm the type that likes to have late night long deep conversations
You should make peace with your past so it doesn't spoil your present.
Nothing's guaranteed but right now it's you that I need ❤
