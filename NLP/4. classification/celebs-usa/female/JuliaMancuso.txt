@leegartner @usskiteam Yes! This is a great idea- we should start training a top secret super talented old school team for the next olympics😂 too bad there aren't extra quota spots.....
I'm just saying nobody asked me if I wanted to make a comeback in the team event🤷‍♀️😜🙌 if we can't find young athletes maybe the old ones can step in!
@_charlie____ @usskiteam @TinaMaze @nytimes @MikaelaShiffrin Yes- ofcourse it's tough to balance training and racing, but the team event should be taken seriously or it should not be an event. And it would be a perfect place to put in youngsters or tech racers that may not be at the world champs level. We have to start somewhere!
I think it's really sad that @usskiteam has neglected the team event again. It's now an Olympic Medal and we should have an incredible team competing there. https://t.co/hyvFuaD6NK
Such a fun day @squawalpine thanks to that team for opening the whole entire mountain!
@Steven_Nyman I agree!!! It really does showcase the best all around athletes.  Just need to even it out a bit...

@69barbra @Are2019 Best ranking still picks odd numbers. I don't think it will matter with cold temps and perfect snow:) nice to be able to watch a few.

@tennis_shots Yeah that's what I read... the internet is such a strange place! I thought I was talking to a legit agent! Until I had to review the documents to sign up... then it seemed fishy
Does anyone have experience with Heath Insurance Innovations? Since retiring from skiing I am now responsible for my health insurance and that sounds way easier said than done! Ha. So this agent sold me a plan that seems like a scam? I'm confused.

@cfsnurfer Shouldn't we leave that to the experts involved in the investigation?
I don't think shooters identities should be public. They don't deserve to be famous for hideous crimes.
So.. just to give some props to the @united customer service team. They contacted us and are ready to make us feel loved despite their mistake last trip. Thanks @united for listening. I'm a loyal customer and it makes a huge difference:)
@Tomtomtomtommie @united 🤙
A little disappointed with the lack of customer service considering the next flights aren't for 9 hours and now we will miss our morning meeting. I guess we will have to settle for a board meeting🤪
Dear @united , we boarded our flight at 1230pm, they messed around with a mechanical problem for 2 hours, let us off just in time to still be able to buy a 3pm flight to sfo. Instead of helping us at the counter, united sent  a less than half full airplane without helping anyone

@LBartenberg @LedeckaEster Gold in Alpine Super G skiing and Gold in Parallel GS snowboard 🎿 🏂
I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! Curling rocks:) https://t.co/6aghxMBWXW
I'm so impressed impressed with @LedeckaEster She won #Gold in two completely different sports at the same #olympics Wow! I always wanted to do multiple sports, and my coaches never let me. I hope this changes everyone's perspective! #BeYourself 🙌
Yes!!! So exciting:) 🙌 https://t.co/FiRYVZxS5b

@yankee8255 @lindseyvonn @MikaelaShiffrin @usskiteam Yes! Good idea:)
@BillyRiceT I didn't say that exactly :) But you know that's the only time we see them at home, sneaking in to find food! I would have one as a pet for sure! But they are a little mischievous 😏
@blytham @MikaelaShiffrin @MarcelHirscher I would say Ester winning gold, because it's so easy to mess up in slalom! But that was still pretty shocking!

This is an exciting race! @michellegisin wow!!!
Yes! I think the split was wrong too @MillerBode
Wow! Overtime in the #usawomenshockey #usaVsCanada
I think @MikaelaShiffrin has a great chance here.... it's proving to be hard to stay close to the slalom skiers on this hill.
This is shaping up to be a great race! Anything is possible!
She has such quick feet! @WendyHoldener nice run!
.@WendyHoldener this is it! She will be going for it
Wow, this slalom course is tight and quick. Doesn't look like you can make up a lot of time in it tho!
I hope @MikaelaShiffrin and @lindseyvonn feel like this after their runs! Go @TeamUSA https://t.co/8iWheXmpla
@GordyMegroz @outsidemagazine @kikkanimal @jessdiggs She is amazing! I'm so happy for them

@mera_naam1990 @23andMe I think pretty far. Not as specific yet but will keep getting better I think!

So @mrDavidWise that was insane! Performance under pressure . WOW
@SteepSkiing No! What a bummer

About to go to sleep just amazed at @kikkanimal and @jessdiggs you ladies freaken rock! That was so incredible and WOW. Kikkan- a mom at your 5th #Olympics now I will 💤 inspired:)

@Hubriscorpus Never! Jumping up and down😂😂🙌
Wow! He is risking it all! @AlexPinturault
He is taking a high line! @LeifHaugen has to keep pushing it!!!
@JGriebichler Yep! 😱
@DepineJoseph @H_Kristoffersen Looking like it! Wow
@GDadrovski @H_Kristoffersen 😂
Tonetti is on the limit!!
@WayneShisler @Olympics @fisalpine @usskiteam Because not all athletes get to compete. Only the best 4 from each country
Looks like @H_Kristoffersen 's time is holding up!!
This will be a good test!
@GDadrovski @Olympics @fisalpine @usskiteam Correct! The Olympics are not part of the World Cup because not all athletes are able to compete (only the countries criteria) so they only award the top 15 with World Cup Start List points WCSL on @fisalpine
Now that's exciting! @H_Kristoffersen will it be enough!?
He needs to come down with a big lead to have a chance at a medal @H_Kristoffersen
Only top 15 receive World Cup points at the @Olympics so this is huge for Ryan Cochran-Siegle that will be great for his confidence on the @fisalpine tour @usskiteam
@John_Ka4y Equipment is crucial in skiing. They do tons of testing, and the snow is especially grippy so he could have had some issues there
A tie! That is crazy when we already measure in hundredths of a second! Wow:)
@escher18 It's a fine line between too late and too early
Bummer for @tedligety but remember it's still an honor to represent @TeamUSA and I am impressed with every athlete fighting back from injury! So much easier said than done:) 🙌
Looking a little soft at the top of the turn again @tedligety
SHRED @tedligety on course:)
RCS 🇺🇸 awesome to see him skiing well!
The snow looks a little softer than when the women raced. Might break up a little...
@M2seKay @ibeTommyFord @Olympics Gold @MarcelHirscher silver @LeifHaugen bronze Tonetti :) let's see!
Yes @ibeTommyFord nice second run:) always great to come down in the lead @Olympics
In case you missed it, it's #WorldWhaleDay and that is my spirit animal:) I'm always searching to swim with them😂❤️🐳 https://t.co/b5OkBiRxdn
@OmarC221 I had a bad injury and wasn't able to get back to top form:(
@clh0206 They reset the course, but it's the same hill(run) the gates just have different placements
Oh I remember this video! Impressive! @Andriragettli https://t.co/xVzw7Tbxpo
@blytham @LeifHaugen Anything can happen in ski racing! One mistake and it all changes. But I think @MarcelHirscher is looking good right now
@Astyeer @Olympics Switched to slopestyle...
@NBCOlympics @TeamUSA @NickGoepper @nbc Nick remembered his poles!!! 🙌😂 @NickGoepper  just teasing:) and I really am curious about that. Does it help or hurt to have poles in Slopestyle?
How crazy is the level of skiing in this #slopestyle @Olympics  incredible!
@chosenhorse2 😂 ski sure! (Does that mean I have to hit the features😜)
Get in the fall line! @ibeTommyFord  (easier said than done)
Nice! 🇮🇹  it's still@possible to have a fast run! Looks good for @ibeTommyFord
@albinoscarecrow @tedligety Typically super g and dh are meant to be longer and just one run. So the total time would be similiar.  But yeah the speed is grueling but actually it will be two runs of dh in the 2022 Olympics because the hill isn't long enough!
@AllanSiman @MarcelHirscher Not calling a gold, just curious to hear who else everyone thinks can do it!
How cool is it when brother and sister are competing in the same Olympics! @manfredmoelgg
Ok! @LeifHaugen is only .03 behind the silver! I had a feeling this was his kind of course! But it isn't over until the 2nd run!
Stay forward!
My dark horse! @LeifHaugen let's go!
@escher18 @MarcelHirscher True! I like his approach! He didn't try to do anything crazy! And he didn't need too
@Whitecaps1 GS is a little different story. The ruts build up a little more with each skier
The course isn't getting faster. These guys need to push it hard if they wanna stay close. I hope they watched Feller, he was risking it and that's what you need to do.
Not much energy in @tedligety skiing... a little too conservative... that is going to be a lot to come back from
Not quite as smooth. Come on @tedligety
There is room for @tedligety to come down with a fast run! Let's go!!!
@BradEssex @LeifHaugen My hip wouldn't let me compete anymore:(
That roll again!!!  Ugh! ❤️ 🇮🇹
Looking forward to @LeifHaugen on this course!
The rivalry between @H_Kristoffersen and @MarcelHirscher is great! They continue to push each other! @H_Kristoffersen will have to step it up second run!
@sdish23 @usskiteam @spyderactive @Steven_Nyman @TommyBiesemeyer @Jared_Goldberg @TeamUSA @spyderactive can help! Not sure when it's on sale
@evbeedev Yes! But not near my home:) hmm I wonder where the closest oval is🤔
@callipygian4lyf He straddled that last gate... both skis have to go around it
Looking good for second run! Impressive how easy he makes that look! @MarcelHirscher
Looking smooth and calm. I think he can attack more! @MarcelHirscher
The king on course! @MarcelHirscher
That last roller is sneaky! Too bad for Feller
What do you guys think? Can anyone get past @MarcelHirscher ?

@blytham I think she would have had a medal without that mistake...
My top moment was winning Gold. It was the last race of Torino, and I had to battle past some prior disappointment and ofcourse it was my childhood dream to get the gold! https://t.co/HaSJ2vrvxN
@blytham She was unlucky and had to choose last. Only choice was 1
@jonasbergfeldt Yes, because you get practice runs so should have a better idea what to expect
@laurarmartin90 Ranking 1-10 have to pick every odd number 1-19 and I think @lindseyvonn got stuck with last pick and got 1
@andrew_mattice Yes! Huge. Ester's best finish was 19th prior to this race. Might be the biggest upset in Olympic ski racing history
@Mika_Byt Yeah .01 is a tough margin. But that can come down to skiing as well.
@raulik81 Oops! I meant Ester! And how cool a snowboard athlete competing in both sports! Winning a gold in the unexpected 🙌
@dtpowski 😂🙌 I am winning the #funolympics
@lindseyvonn You are skiing amazing! @lindseyvonn I ave no doubt!
@NBCOlympics Yes!!!! This is amazing. Those bears.
@Heiz_16 @ericrjohnson I don't like this new system. It's not fair...
I would say the most disappointed has to be @Laragut .01 off the podium now. Tough place to be...
So @JamieAsnow you are gonna love this story! How did you win Esther? "Well I am probably the only snowboarder at the start" 😂🙌 #OlympicSuperGchamp
@tar2379 Typically this is true.. but in alpine you can never count anyone out.
In Alpine skiing you can't never count anyone out!!! WOW
It looks like Esther is in awe!!! She can't believe it.
I'm sitting here talking about the race and my husband is like how can @NBCOlympics call is already... and sure enough!

I saw some wind during @RagMow ... dang!
Now @RagMow skiing so smooth
Wow @anna_veith seriously impressive!!!!!!!
A little time to make up @anna_veith she has come back from so much!!! Great to see her skiing well again
You can loose so much at the bottom! Just like @lindseyvonn @RagMow still to come
Vicky is looking solid! All of the ladies are skiing so well!
She is an all or nothin kind of athlete
Slow start for Goggia. But she is going fast now!
Great run for @lalalalaurenne ❤️❤️🇺🇸 not the podium but a really great execution
Go @lalalalaurenne find that special gear!!!!
Ahh  and she comes down in 4th. Have to nail those jumps.
Here she goes! @FedeBrignone has a great touch on the snow
. @lalalalaurenne coming up soon! Go girl!  She has been coming back from injury and she is a fighter! Let's go!!
It may be tough for little Nicole Schmidhofer. It's a pretty flat course.
One hundredth to @TinaWeirather its a tough race!!! That bottom section is so tricky.
The same thing happened to me in Vancouver, started 1st and made one mistake because of no real course report. It's the toughest starting position https://t.co/dufkRdujRi
@woodsofnj 😂😂 I wish I was so bad! That is my kind of course (was 😜)
@andrew_mattice Both! She wasn't the fastest on top but was picking up a lot of speed on the bottom causing that mistake...
I still see a lot of time on that course... not sure @Laragut will stay on the podium
@Laragut putting down some solid skiing. You can't throw your skis sideways at all tho!!!
Still seeing a lot of time to be made on this course....
Wow! Hanna! You are ripping!
This course looks so fun!
Nooo! She was having a great run. But that's not gonna be good enough..., sorry @lindseyvonn
Sometimes nerves help:) extra adrenaline
Looking nervous!! Go @lindseyvonn
My predictions @goggiasofia @FedeBrignone @lindseyvonn  I think bib 1 might be tough! But if they lowered the start @lindseyvonn can really push it! It is a stacked super g! @TinaWeirather @Laragut @anna_veith so many favorites!
It's time! Turn on your TVs, tune in to @NBCOlympics to watch the queen! @lindseyvonn
@antopettit @John_Ka4y @lindseyvonn @lalalalaurenne @AliceMckennis @TeamUSA Not sure. I'm not there.... so I don't know how windy it is
I hope the wind stops so we can see some racing!!! @lindseyvonn @lalalalaurenne @AliceMckennis Breezy Johnson @TeamUSA 🙌
@Lozares Ahh! This is the best. ❤️
@angelakevans @thekellyclark This is such a sweet story. ❤️❤️ I love it! @chloekimsnow and @thekellyclark you guys are the best. 🥇
@SkiersRight @fisalpine I think they (South Koreans) don't know much about some of the sports, and so they don't show up... not many foreigners around...
@MurdocNichols @fisalpine Yeah, I heard that too. Sooo maybe they should have had the Olympics a little earlier? I don't see many foreigners here...
Olympic Superstore is where it's at in #PyeongChang2018 https://t.co/n4rZYVQFVa
I found the people!!! @fisalpine https://t.co/5khKEkGbwX
From the continuous shadow of @MikaelaShiffrin she picked the right day to shine!!! Congrats Frida https://t.co/vwQxm2UeN6
So Frida saw me at the start and came over to say hi! She was cool and calm and won the gold! Legend! https://t.co/5aIebwYpy0
Ok! I am loving how all these ladies are skiing this course. It's nice and flowy! Way to charge. One thing we do know is that @MikaelaShiffrin can throw down fast second runs. Let's go!
And the big surprise @RagMow yay! I'm so happy I called that on live tv:) ❤️❤️🙌🙌
She did it! @MikaelaShiffrin amazing! Way to show the world:)
Go @FedeBrignone ❤️🙌 https://t.co/3VO7f7sPK4
Getting ready for the 2nd run of GS here. Can @MikaelaShiffrin win! Do you guys remember who won the last Gold in gs for  @TeamUSA ? Hint hint😜❤️ @NBCOlympics #pyeongchang2018
Wow!!! @Kjansrud and @akselsvindal  impressive show so far!
Bravo! @akselsvindal 🙌
😂 https://t.co/m0ffjjzLTH
Wow! Lots of air and @BeatFeuz is risking it!
Dh time! Excited:)
@MikeCowher @MillerBode I know I couldn't do it without the support of my husband! Regardless of my results after getting married:) the lack of results was more because of my injury, and I would have never been back in the starting gate without him!
@Whitecaps1 Yeah, it's pretty tough! I hear a lot of talk about how the lunar new year at the same time is keeping some of the crowd away...  I was at the halfpipe and that was the first packed event!
@SteepSkiing Hill looks super tough! Excited to see how second run is set
@MikeCowher I hope that was a joke:) pretty sure @MillerBode was trying to be funny...
@struppe Cancellations make it hard!
@AP This is so disturbing and needs to change. 🙏
Italy looking strong in the gs! 2 more to go in the top 15.  @MikaelaShiffrin safely down in 2nd, that will set her up for 2nd run nicely.
What a tough course! What do you guys think? #womensgs
Inside the booth getting my first behind the scenes look at the @NBCOlympics production with @DanHicksNBC and @MillerBode  let's go! https://t.co/yz1jGbKCzH

Watch tonight on the Olympic zone! I'm challenging @shaunwhite in air hockey! Who do you think will win! https://t.co/7MIQqT1Rfl
So @MikaelaShiffrin is finally racing tomorrow!!! What do you guys think? 5 Golds? https://t.co/FC8Gez8eer
@_Pauli Hey! YeH that looks too high. It should be flat rate of around 75$
. @MarcelHirscher so impressive!! Congrats on your first gold🥇of the games! I have a feeling you aren't finished! 🙌
@cmccoyjr Thanks:) I miss it too!!!

One thing that always stuck in my mind, that's always true for big events. You can never count anyone out. Including yourself. Anything can happen. Who is excited for the @Olympics ! I can't wait to see who will step up!
Uh oh! Mikaela might be feeling the pressure of the Olympics! No doubt a couple weeks of training can get her back in the game.
Meanwhile things are shaping up @squawalpine with a foot of new snow! ❤️❄️ https://t.co/sGlQypnbJ9
Thanks to Spyder Active Sports for always being legendary in ski racing:) https://t.co/qdgwVnygzx
@lalalalaurenne I will miss you girl but look forward to more speed unicorn wins!!! ❤️❤️
Wow! It's bumpy. Great skiing by the Italians so far!
Ps. I'm not racing. Saving my energy and hoping to have my best races in Cortina!!! One more week to qualify for the Olympics! 🙌🤞
Schedule a women's downhill and bad weather will come😂😂 bad luck again! Short dh starting now! Go @usskiteam
@_Pauli That's incredibly sad. We are going backwards in so many ways...
Well, I didn't feel great at warmup today, and with that course you had to charge 100%. So I had to pass. Congrats @FedeBrignone 🙌
@TravisGanong You got this! 🙌🙌
@MsIngaSpoke @sporino Not out yet! Still working towards the Olympics. It's a tough road! But miracles happen:)
Spoil alert😂  @MikaelaShiffrin is amazing! Continues to dominate and impress! 🙌
@allriseyanks99 @fisalpine 😂 I'm talking about the parallel race... I'm not actually racing in it! Haha. But thanks:)
And the red course is way faster... @fisalpine why only one run?
I love parallel:) this course is pretty straight tho! I do t think it should be considered slalom... #nonevent
Heading to @courchevel to cheer on the ladies! Tomorrow looks like a powder day, looking for a guide to show us the sweet spots! Anyone around?
Yeah 🙌❤️ to both of you:) https://t.co/iQljshZEDQ
