## MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This repository contains the code for the MNIST digit classification problem. This dataset is considered the 'Hello World' of machine learning. This project is my solution to an exercise of the Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow book by Aurélien Géron.
